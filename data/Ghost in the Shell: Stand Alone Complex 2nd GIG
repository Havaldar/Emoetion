i'd rewatch GitS, but i think three eps per two days is a bit fast paced since i'll be back in school by the time we start.
>> ARTICLE
Pssh. 3 episodes? Nothing. I watch that much everyday regardless school or not. And I still get my homework done. 
>> ARTICLE
this is college i'm talking about, a college engineering program and 17 credit hours which is equivalent to probably about 19 non-engineering credit hours.

Wait until you get a job..

Work is far easier than school if your engineering program is worth its salt. 
>> ARTICLE
You can't spare 3x25 minutes in 2 days? I find that either really troubling or amazing (if becouse of that hard dedication)

Or the movies count as 1 ep as well?
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has done full time university course work and full time job work at the same time, it is more on the troubling side. Pulling consecutive 80, 90 + hour weeks is awful.
>> ARTICLE
There was no mention of work, but yeah, with both it's pretty much the weekends left only
>> ARTICLE
You know people have other hobbies than just watching chinese cartoons, right?
>> ARTICLE
I do, but really you can't spare 40 minutes a day? I mean really, i understand that a lot of us work 8(or more) hours a day, have to do chores, prolly watch over kids as well, but it's 40 damned minutes, I'm not against making in less ep/day, just saying that I wouldn't really participate in an event when I can't keep up with a reasonable pace.
>> ARTICLE
> just saying that I wouldn't really participate in an event when I can't keep up with a reasonable pace.

They wouldn't be participating in that case then.  They *want* to participate and are lobbying to try to get the schedule to be one that they will be able to participate in.

But the other issue is that maybe they can find 40 minutes per day on *most* days, but not all and not much if any more than 40-50 minutes.  Then they have to miss a day and now they need to watch 80 minutes to be caught up, then they miss 2 days for some reason and they're behind 120-150 minutes and it spirals out of control and they can no longer participate.  If its only one episode per day then its much easier to find time to catch up on the days you have to miss.
>> ARTICLE
Okay then, let's count with 30 mins a day right? 1 ep, third of a movie per day. That makes this little rewatch thing 3+3+26+26+3+10+3 =74 days long. That counting no downtime, no let's wait for others, instant transition from 1 part to another. More realistically it'd be ~ 3 months at least. With the 3 ep /2 day, it's be more like 2+2+18+18+2+7+2 = 61 days, we saved 2 weeks, with adding 10 minutes of watchtime each day. I don't know of others but I tend to lose attention pretty fast. Watching a series for about 3 months or 2,5 IS a big deal for me :) 

Also you can still miss a day, and the 30 min plus every other day doesn't seem unmanageable. What could be a solution is what OP tried to do, that we all have a week to catch up in between the parts.
>> ARTICLE
It's not an issue of can't/inability, it's that they don't want to or would like some more flexibility. A rewatch/group watch is a community effort, so it's not unreasonable to ask for the event to be more accommodating. Sure, the organizer can say "smell you later, peace" but that defeats the purpose of getting people to join you in a group activity.
>> ARTICLE
My school's engineering program is founded on the principle of taking up 100% of our free time.

I'm in an engineering univ as well, but (seems like fortunately) I've got enough free time any day
>> ARTICLE
yes, you're not at my college though XD
>> ARTICLE
unless you are from Budapest, you are prolly right :)
>> ARTICLE
but anyways it's not so much that i have zero free time as the work load will go like 2 weeks with hardly any homework, then 2 where i'm spending almost every minute working on homework/studying/projects.
>> ARTICLE
That sounds more like it :) we also have the 7th and 14th (last) weeks, they are pretty much w/o any sleep :)
>> ARTICLE
did your professors also give you a speech on your first day of your first engineering class about how from that point on you had no life? that was such a great pep talk!
>> ARTICLE
Nah, they just stated that ~40% of us will ever be finishing it :)

(Also who the hell is downvoting every comment?)

I'll rethink the pacing of the watch when I get more feedback. I didn't think about school.

Black leather seats. FeelsBadMan.

But to be on topic, I'd be hella down for a GitS rewatch as my first rewatch in this sub. 
>> ARTICLE
Paint and window tint seems to matter more than seat color (though leather vs. cloth, and type of leather matter a *lot.*) At least this is my experience having owned a light grey car with dark blue seats and now a black car with beige seats.

Oh yea definitely. I've got a navy blue sedan with black leather seats. I'd open the car doors after it being in the sun and you can see the hot air radiating from the upholstery like you could fry an egg on them.

I work in Tx, it is indeed hot as hell. I agree with how he felt now.

GitS: SAC is my favourite anime series. I think it is worth mentioning (since OP stipulates it influenced pop culture) that GitS from 1995 lay the ground work for the matrix. The writers for the Matrix literally source GitS as the inspiration and both stories parallel at many points.

As for the influence GitS has had on hollywood, here is a [source](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/19/hollywood-ghost-in-the-shell)

EDIT: formatting

Ghost in the shell is one of those anime that I should have really seen by now, count me in.

Same boat

Yup. I still havent seen GitS, Cowbow Bebop, Evangelion, or Angel Beats.

Neither have I. To add to my shame, I haven't seen death note or Fullmetal alchemist.

I've downloaded all of it then just looked at multiple times. It's intimidating for some reason

The main visual for the first thing is intimidating. Plus it sounds like the kind of show that is thought provoking.

>thought provoking


Dear Lord, wouldn't it be just *the worst* to have to think guys?
>> ARTICLE
I can understand their reason though. Sometimes, people don't want to spend the effort to think when they watching something. For them, it's much enjoyable to let the "thinking part" arise naturally rather than being bombarded right from the start.

Recent example? Gakkou Gurashi first episode.

To be fair, the tech in the franchise is basically at indistinguishable-from-magic stage

Real talk: Non Non Biyori is a legitimately good show. It will never be the juggernaut of GITS, but show some respect to Moeshishi. 
>> ARTICLE
I've watched a few episodes of Non Non Biyori and enjoyed the experience. It's a nice show that's kind of different from what I usually watch, which is mostly shows like Ghost in the Shell. 

Pleasantly surprised, would watch again. 
>> ARTICLE
People hardly mention it because they would sound like broken records at this point. Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop and all of these other series that have reached the status of classics are praised so frequently that literally anyone who's even just slightly interested in anime as a medium will have at least heard of them. I suppose that at this point, going around and recommending either of these series would be the equivalent of saying: 'Hey guys, did you hear of this band called the Beatles? They're pretty good, you should check them out!'.
>> ARTICLE
You say that as though there aren't too many kids who don't understand the influence The Beatles has. 

I don't think GitS *needs* to be mentioned at every turn, but I don't think there is anything wrong with taking some time to reaffirm why we all respect it so much.
>> ARTICLE
\>You say that as though there aren't too many kids who don't understand the influence The Beatles has.

Yeah, but who cares? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not against your idea of a rewatch by any means, I just found it strange to see someone claim that a show which has reached such an incredible amount of popularity is supposedly 'hardly mentioned'. 

When I first got into anime (not long ago), I constantly read 'watch Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Ghost in the Shell and Legend of the Galactic Heroes' everywhere, so you can be assured that we newbies are aware of the existence of these series, even when you think they deserve more attention. 
>> ARTICLE
I think a healthy community needs a certain level of "darn kids don't understand the good stuff" in the attitudes of it's population. 

Though you are right. I don't think there would be many who haven't at least heard of GitS and praise it tends to get.

Personally I wrote the rewatch suggestion this way because I thought it was a fun angle to write from. Not because I truly believe the show has become an obscure dusty gem from the past.
>> ARTICLE
Could it be that Gits is just more universally accepted? I think we see eva come up a lot because there are people who didn't understand it or just didn't like it.

I think there's no denying that they're all good suggestions for beginner level shows, but for me Ghost is the only one that really holds up past the nostalgia and changing demographic tides. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, I guess one of the reasons EVA is pretty famous is because the girls in it are pretty top tier waifu material despite not being moe anime. Also Hdeaki Anno is just boss.

The thing about anime today is that it's mostly about moe otaku pandering and best girl arguments, both of which doesn't really apply to GiTS. Most of otaku and anime fans today like their 2d waifus to be cute wife material and not some capable battle bitch who can shoot bullets through them if the situation calls for it. While GiTS does explore the territory of eroticism, it's more exploratory in nature and less pandering.

I think us people who grew up in the era of Bebop, GiTS and EVA are them ones who really value storytelling in our anime and consider fanservice just a bonus. Of course we had fanservice anime  back then too, but if you compare Ranma to say something like Freezing, you can see how much fanservice is now brought to the limelight nowadays.
>> ARTICLE
I agree for the most part. Though I do generally think the manga is under appreciated. That shit gets *dense*. It's really a triumph. 
I know we're talking about the anime here but I feel like the manga doesn't get enough love. 
>> ARTICLE
Its funny you should pick the Beatles as your example. You may recall recently Kanye West collaborating with Paul McCartney to a torrent of twits twittering their twatness.

I wish I could agree with you, but after seeing Motoko get kicked out of the Best Girl contest by a side-character from Oreimo, I think it's abundantly clear that most of this sub just hasn't seen it.
>> ARTICLE
Tbf I don't really see Motoko as a girl you know.
>> ARTICLE
She should be though. Motoko is a wonderful classic main character.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention she's not your standard best girl material. I was definitely rather salty when she got knocked out so early but i understood. She's a bad bitch. Bad bitches will always lose to moeshit, hyper-kawaii and more typical character types
>> ARTICLE
Good fucking lord, Motoko is sexy as hell, in more ways than one. She has an actual personality, independent, can kick your ass and handle a gun, can outthink, outstrategize you. And that scene with that kid asking if cyborgs can have sex and she ask if he wanna  try it. Omg, fucking fuck fuck!
>> ARTICLE
Is that in the series I don't remember it from the movie.
>> ARTICLE
2nd season, GitS 2nd gig, ep 17.
>> ARTICLE
And probably the best sex imaginable with the ghost link.
>> ARTICLE
The original manga by Masamune Shirow had a lot of eroticism based on ghost linking while having sex IIRC, so yea that was also explored. GitS is like the Simpsons of cyberpunk. GitS did it! GitS did it! GitS did it!
>> ARTICLE
Oh damn son! I didn't thought the manga would have ehmm more important topics then the anime . I need to read something up. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I'd probably say that Masamune Shirow is primarily an erotic artist who happens to have also drawn Appurushido, Dominion, and Ghost in the Shell.

>> ARTICLE
I'm glad in a way. You have to be otaku "waifu" material to win that kind of contest, and that doesn't suit Motoko at all.
>> ARTICLE
I've said it before and I'll say it again: It's a Best Fuckdoll contest, not a Best Girl contest. Unfortunately, character strength doesn't mean anything compared to sex appeal.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck it. GitS SAC is one of the best series ever made imo, and I've been meaning to rewatch it and delve deeper into analysis. Guess I might as well join in.
>> ARTICLE
I'm seeing a lot of good things about it here and I don't get it. I watched the 1995 movie and it was amazing. Then I watched stand alone complex and I never watched GitS again. Sure it had some very good content, but it was so diluted it was really underwhelming.
>> ARTICLE
Different strokes for different folks I suppose. The movie without a doubt accomplishes a LOT given its time length, and it has definitely established a prominent place for itself among the greatest works of fiction ever. However, SAC takes the underlying themes we are introduced to in the movie and examines them in depth. It is arguable whether or not the pace at which it does explore these themes is well executed, but I feel that the way it throws the grittiness of the original film in your face in combination with a more intimate look into the philosophical undertones of the cyberpunk world the characters inhabit (ESPECIALLY the second season) is awesome. The writing and direction are also far more complex than the film's (though the original film's animation is historical and far more intricate direction and care was used)

And then there's the fact that SAC delivers some of the most fascinating characters in anime. Two seasons and several spinoffs worth. How can you not love that?

I think one of the big reasons why people don't talk about it that much on this subreddit is the same reason why we don't talk about a *lot* of other classic shows.

This subreddit is more dedicated to talking about stuff that is new or oncoming, we've already seen and know the classics very well. There are occasionally threads that are more geared towards discussion of anime as a whole, but they also get to be redundant quickly. 

A rewatch though isn't a bad idea if people are on board.
>> ARTICLE
I have seen GitS 1995 only, it is definitely one of the best sci-fi movies has ever been made. I don't know if SAC is as good as the movie ?
>> ARTICLE
I personally think the SAC is better than the film, but only because the film takes itself way too seriously and the manga rarely did. The character designs IMHO of SAC are closer to the manga too.
>> ARTICLE
SAC is very different from the films. I would say they're on equal footing as works, but it has to be said that the 1995 benefits from the detailed efforts that can only be done in the highly focused film format. While I love SAC, it does suffer from the sometimes lower levels of quality that almost need to be there when producing as much content as a 52 episode series demands.

You're in for a treat with SAC, but don't expect the same minute to minute levels of brilliance as from GitS 1995.
>> ARTICLE
I first saw GITS 1995 when I was really young. It's an amazing movie and one of my favorite animes if not my favorite. I really like the GITS SAC series and it's one of my favorites too. I think they're both really good. To me the movie is a seminal masterpiece that cannot be topped really. Because that's just what it was, a classic. However the series is amazing, and should not be overlooked. If you liked the movie I def recommend checking out the series. 

For more detailed explanation read further.

This is how I explain the difference between the movie and the series. The movie is a bit slower paced with bursts of action here and there and focuses a lot on atmosphere and on philosophizing in between. This is really great for fans of the anime as it does what it does right. 

Now the series is a little bit different, it's brighter for one, Makoto's outfit is a bit more revealing but she's still a badass, and where the movie focused on philosophy, the show focuses on political machinations and badass police procedural stuff and crazy crime-things. I would also say there's more action. It's a *really* good show. So I think they're both very good they just focus on different areas.

I hope you enjoy.

Oh, and while you're at it check out GITS 2 : Innocence, starring Batou, it's a little bit slower and with more philosophizing than the first but it's a good movie, and some even claim to like it more than the first movie. You might enjoy watching it before you move on to the series.
>> ARTICLE
I think SAC is actually better than the film. A part of it has to do with the difference in narrative structure, but I personally feel that SAC has actual arguments it posits, fleshed out characters and a strong sense of direction in its narrative where the film lacks in all these regards.
>> ARTICLE
That's great to hear because those are exactly the things I thought 1995 fell short on.
>> ARTICLE
How would you say GitS 2.0 is compared to 1995? I got the impression it was like a remaster or remake or the 1995, released in 2008? 
>> ARTICLE
I watched Innocence and the '95 film, but not the 2.0. What you say is exactly how I understand it though. I can't tell you if it's better to watch it or anything, but I thought the '95 film looked pretty great as it was, so I don't know if there's a need to watch 2.0.
>> ARTICLE
2.0 is widely regarded as the lesser (understatement) version. You can watch it if you want to, but please don't skip the 1995 version.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't watch the series after watching the films. The change in pacing and especially visual quality (the films look amazing but the series looks pretty mediocre) was too much to keep me interested.
>> ARTICLE
To each his own. I just value a narrative with direction and exploration of themes through developing characters and their interactions a bit more than visual quality or otherwise I'd be prefer currently airing shows over shows like GitS.
>> ARTICLE
Saying its better than the film is a pretty big leap. As good as maybe, but the original film is an immensely impressive work of art. The second season is probably closer to the quality of the film.

This is coming from someone who has a lot of respect for both.
>> ARTICLE
The second season was more exciting and had a stronger script, but the plot was worse than the first season. The first season more closely captures the spirit of the film even though it's a bit stiff in its execution. The climaxes of the first season do a much better job of displaying the themes of Ghost in the Shell than the second season. Both are good, but neither should be compared directly the the film since a film has to accomplish its goal in about 2 hours whereas the shows used 26 episodes per season.
>> ARTICLE
We already had one for SAC like 3 months ago and the discussion threads got like no comments at all so I don't think it is going to work out well unfortunately.
>> ARTICLE
No one ever participates in the Anime Club discussions.
>> ARTICLE
That's all the Anime Club threads though. I don't know if it is the shows they watch or something else, but they're always nearly empty for whatever reason.
>> ARTICLE
Possibly but this sub typically doesn't watch the kind of show GitS is. They more about the pop type shows. KnK rewatch seems to have some momentum currently so maybe times are changing. It's also a fairly older show where most of this sub hasn't really been watching anime past 5 years ago. KnK benefits from being rather gorgeous and not too old compared.
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher I'm excited 
>> ARTICLE
you're in for a treat :)
>> ARTICLE
I would do it too. I love Ghost in the Shell as it was one of the first anime that I watched and the primary reason why I got into anime.
>> ARTICLE
GitS is one of those shows that I've started watching so many times and dropped. Which doesn't make sense, it's the genre that I like and everything, and I've seen the movie so many times and I love it. 

Since there are so many episodes I feel like starting from the beginning is too hard, but picking up where I left off (which I'm never sure where that is) ends up too difficult to follow. I get caught in this limbo that leads me to trip over the too-hard basket and drop it again.

I have a 7 day weekend coming up though. So I can either binge on it over that period, or try and join in on this rewatch... I've never done one of these things before, but I think I could keep up. 

Will see what dates get decided on and then I'll decide, but thanks for posting this, it reminds me that I really need to try again! :3
>> ARTICLE
GitS is such an important watch, even for people who are not fans of anime. I would possibly be down for joining this.
>> ARTICLE
Its sad how the poor mans ghost in the shell is more popular than ghost in the shell itself 
 

People raving about how deep and complex pp is sigh...
>> ARTICLE
Psycho Pass holds your hand to gently guide you through its ideas. Much more time is spent to make sure concepts get across properly, and this is clear through the inclusion of the newbie Akane.

Ghost in the Shell wouldn't spend more than a sentence to explain who Spooky Boogie is. It expects the viewer to keep up and doesn't mind if some don't weather the ride. Development plays out at the pace characters would be keeping up with, and there is no rookie to bog down the speed of things. Togusa is a master detective from the get go.

They're differently done shows, and they both come with their flaws. The rather more careful approach of PP isn't as much to my personal taste as GitS, but it's no wonder that the former was able to appeal to such a wide audience as it did.
>> ARTICLE
While I have watched, and enjoyed ghost in the shell, clearly laying out the ideas and themes doesn't make a show bad( like psycho pass).

Being bad at illustrating, and conveying ideas and themes is often a sign of poor editing / directing - and being obvious and easy to understand is if anything, not a bad approach.

Now don't mistake me, I think GitS is amazing, but i think criticising psycho pass for being easy to understand, or "holding someone's hand "through it is a bad argument. If anything in modern cinema ( you can argue it's declining or becoming dumber/ worse but that's beside the point) it's generally thought to be better to convey themes and ideas very clearly.

>> ARTICLE
Sorry, maybe I should have been more clear on my thoughts:

I really liked Psycho Pass a whole lot. It think it stands on its own and I hope we don't spend too much time in these threads talking it down compared to GitS.

I just wanted to shed light on why it doesn't pull the same strings GitS does with its own fans. It didn't mean it as a criticism.
>> ARTICLE
Pp is a good gateway  to this genre with it being easy in the eye and a proven formula its no wonder  its popular.  But the world building, story and mc development of gits is on another level.




>> ARTICLE
They're similar in the sense that both are cyberpunk crime thrillers so I get why people make the comparison but it's like comparing apples to pineapples. Aome of the fundamental themes differ quite a bit. Psycho Pass focuses heavily on some of the Foucauldian philosophy from Discipline and Punish, panopticism, and a few other philosophical/sociological themes that borders on excessive name-dropping (I mean I didn't even see the point of some of the stuff like Joseph Conrad). 

GitS on the other hand, focuses on what it means to be human, a machine, an individual, or to have consciousness. There's also quite a bit of social criticisms surrounding stagnation and dependency that rises from information technology. 

So as a whole, it's a lot less about power relations discourse in society and more about the constituents of the society. Then again, I haven't even finished the first season of GitS SAC so take that with a grain of salt.

Other than the genre, they both share some similarities in that it doesn't focus on a singular main character and share the sort of imperfection running side by side with technological advancement (which is arguably inherent in the cyberpunk genre). I think the characters in both series are quite interesting, but Psycho Pass makes the point of focusing more on the antagonist and actually show some things from his perspective while GitS focuses more on maintaining the mystery. At their heart though, they're both crime thrillers centered around police work. I think GitS makes you think a lot more given each case though.

I'm completely ignoring the existence of Psycho Pass 2 by the way. I mean what the fuck was THAT rofl.

Another comparison that's probably the most important is the structure of the narrative. GitS is much more episodic with specifically dedicated episodes that are seemingly independent of the overarching plot. I had missed this narrative structure initially when I picked up the show 3 years ago since I didn't give it enough episodes to see how some of them fit together.

To me, this is the most fascinating part about GitS, in that the narrative structure directly reflects some of the themes it talks about. This "Stand Alone Complex" theory they speak of sort of weaves together social theories of group behavior and Baudrillardian philosophy of the simulacra and shows a much more concrete manifestation of the precession of simulacra, as Baudrillard calls it. It doesn't make a strong thesis around it so far that I've seen like he does in saying information technology exacerbates this issue, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's where they go with it by the end.
>> ARTICLE
GitS also chose a really interesting way to explore these themes by including the J. D. Salinger angle, thereby invoking an actual example of this phenomenon in Mark David Chapman's shooting of John Lennon and identification with Holden Caulfield, the subsequent shootings also claiming *The Catcher in the Rye* as inspiration, and the lack of basis for these actions within the book itself.  
Beyond that, it is one of the few series I've seen where the politics and international relations are actually believable.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was really interesting but at the same time that the reference was a little bit off? Perhaps a weaker example than ones they might have had if they were to do a remake today since there have been incidents over the internet that closely mimicks the phenomenon described. It seemed like a critical component of SAC was that it asserts a sort of concerted effort which the reference itself doesn't really articulate, merely that there were imitations unfaithful to the original.

Or did I miss something about how the reference was presented that makes a different argument? I initially assumed it was just the starting point that helped them figure out the nature of the copycat behavior, but it felt like with that exact comment about the Salinger that they were trying to imply something else.

Either way, to me, the nicest part was that the show doesn't rely on a specific individual reference to convey the themes and instead has it embedded all across the show.

I'm watching the second season currently and I feel like the way they're presenting SAC has changed too, but I'm not quite sure what they're trying to articulate yet. It's sort of as if they're asserting that a specific entity can and ought to take advantage of the phenomenon? Not even half way done though so hopefully I'll find out later.
>> ARTICLE
The absence of an original in the context of Mark David Chapman, was that he claimed that he was inspired to kill Lennon by a passage from the book.  However, the passage has nothing to do with killing and there is not act of violence in the book that he could be imitating.
>> ARTICLE
Right, I was just pointing out that I felt like that specific example misses out on the copycat behaviors amounting to a singular concerted effort. Maybe I shouldn't think of the actual SAC phenomenon as a theme that covers everything the show talks about, particularly since it was brought up closer to the end and the Salinger reference was first used to articulate the initial cause of the phenomenon rather than the phenomenon in its entirety.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I see what you mean now and agree on the point about the difference between the appearance of a single effort, rather than random, unrelated shootings.  The show definitely has way more to it than just exploring the SAC phenomenon and is really the entry point for its other more complex and subtle postmodernist and post-structuralist themes.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's the part I appreciate the most about this show--that the way it explores those themes in various ways, some of which are rather subtle. When I watched Psycho-pass, it felt like the entirety of the narrative was suppose to be characters trying to answer specific questions about the themes. 

In GitS so far, I feel like a lot of the themes are presented with more tact. For example, the exploration of the concept of the "self" is done through character interactions and development as much as it is articulated through dialogue. Similarly, different levels of power relations and construction of worldview on both a personal and societal level are presented in a lot of different angles. In that sense, a lot of it feels to me like a food for thought rather than a clumsy thesis about the themes.

In doing so, I think it leaves the actual narrative of the political/crime thriller to be unhindered by the philosophical discussion in most episodes.

GitS is super good, as is Full Metal Drive (same mangaka) and Appleseed. GitS and Appleseed practically invented cyberpunk.  I think the reason people lean toward psycho pass atm is because it's more relevant, it's relatable, it reflects our fears and concerns of the use of technology in our personal lives, surveillance, right to self agency, and the safe little world the middle class has insulated itself with that is itself laying in the uncanny valley. 
>> ARTICLE
Appleseed and GitS both by Masume Shirow, were both after his 1983 *Black Magic M-66* which was after Blade Runner. He didnt invent cyberpunk, but was certainly influential in spreading it in many different directions.

Edit: Are you talking about "Real Drive"?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Drive

sorry about that being a mobile link.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I always fuck up the name.  Anyways I didn't say he created it I said practically and everybody is latching onto it as if I said he was the first.  For practical purposes his works invented cyberpunk as I know it.  Yeah there was some shit before but it was pretty base.  Masume gave it the imagine it has today and even influenced SR down the road (4th edition).  Interpret that how you like but this whole thing has become horrible pedantic and I'm not interested in continuing it further.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with your statement is that while it may be your introduction to cyberpunk, its not everybody elses, nor is it the first of its general genre. While you may have meant it as a personal reference, thats not how it comes across in the text, nor is there ample subtext readily appearent to support it either. Because it is not the first, or even most well known, popular or commonly cited beginning of cyberpunk any statements that refer to it as "practically inventing" will be called out as wrong. 

Also

> "Yeah there was some shit before but it was pretty base"

... right. 
>> ARTICLE
> Full Metal Drive

What's that? I can't find anything about that.
>> ARTICLE
It's called Real Drive; I always fuck up the name because what essentially amounts to a proto-cybernet is called "The Metal".  It's pretty good but with a much brighter colors than Masume's most famous works but it actually works really well given the dark undercurrent behind the technology the show revolves around.

Unofficially "The Metal" is like the precursor tech to the cybernetics in GitS.  There are some similarity's but it's also a bit of a stretch; anyways you should check it out.
>> ARTICLE
GitS didn't invent cyberpunk. It did revive it, though, and the franchise as a whole has influenced the genre's transition into post-cyberpunk.
>> ARTICLE
> GitS and Appleseed practically invented cyberpunk

Hold your horses, cyberpunk is older that GitS by a fair amount of time. [Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F) is from 1968, the movie it inspired Blade Runner is from 1982. One of the clasic novels in cyberpunk, [Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) came out in 1984. In tabletop RPGs [Cyberpunk 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020) is 1988, [Shadowrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun) is from 1989. Heck even in anime [Bubblegum Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubblegum_Crisis) started its run in 1987. 

Most of those I listed where ether current with the Appleseed manga run from 1985-89, and all before, or contemporary to GitS original run in 1989.

I'm watching SAC right now so it might be a little too early for me to actually do a rewatch but I'd love to join in on the discussion. I have so much to say about this show but obviously there's no active discussion on it anywhere these days.

I've only seen the first movie, so I'll gladly participate.

Definitely up for a GitS rewatch. Embarrassingly, I've only seen SAC - never watched the movies, and the general consensus seems to be that the movies are the best parts, so this should be a treat. Not sure I like the proposed pacing, though. GitS episodes can get really heavy and have loads of discussion potential. I'd be more inclined to say 1 episode every two days, even though that would take a while.

Isn't there a 4 episode Arise series in there somewhere too?

Arise was originally 4 movies.

Arise Alternate Architecture is that but cut up in to a TV series and rearranged with 2 new episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps we can threads at differing intervals for episodes that are Stand-alone and those that are Complex. They would certainly be different kinds of discussions, the Complex episodes building and compiling on each other's themes and direction and the Stand-alone episodes being simpler and more focused but potentially just as deep. 

EDIT: We would have to look at the order and breakdown of episodes, but maybe we can aim for 3 complex and 2 standalone episodes a week or vice versa. We probably don't need to go at the same pace the whole way either, just not so fast that we lose people along the way.

The 1995 GitS movie is my favourite movie of all time, and the franchise itself is also my favourite. I even have the data ports many of the cyborgs have tattoo'd onto the back of my neck (a subtle sign of appreciation, recognised by anyone who shares the same interest).

I'm a little worried that Innocence will put a lot of people off of the series though. While I really enjoy it, it gets really philosophical and artistic. Very heavy, which I don't doubt could be a bit much for people who are still making up their minds about the franchise.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved the first movie but never got into the series. Hearing that Innocence just gets more philosophical and artistic makes me excited to explore the rest of the series. The last thing I want from GitS is spectacle without substance.
>> ARTICLE
Innocence takes it to it's furthest extreme. At points the characters are literally talking in nothing but proverbs and references to various philosophers and their work, which while relevant to the plot, also make it very inaccessible.

I think it's still absolutely fantastic, but, don't be discouraged if you feel lost at some points, and find quite a few things going over your head.

If you still manage to enjoy the movie, it's worth taking the time to read some in-depth analysis that will really explain a lot of the dialogue and imagery.

the first GitS movie is my favorite animated movie of all time (maybe next to/after Princess Mononoke). I love the Stand Alone Complex series though it's extremely different in style and atmosphere, compared to the movie. It was so differnet in fact, that I absolutely hated it the first time I started watching it and cancelled it after 5 eps. I love the movie so much, that when I saw the series right afterwards, it really scared me off, because it had such a different tone to it. It wasn't as dark as the 1995 movie.

Last year, after years of hating Stand Alone Complex I decided to give it another try and what I realized was, that the series was simply a new interpretation of the manga, rather than a sequel to the movie. It's a different universe. Once I accepted it, I really learned to love Stand Alone Complex for what it is. A cyberpunk thriller series, with much heavier focus on politics, rather than philosophy. It doesn't make Stand Alone Complex bad, it just makes it different.

Though I gotta say, the first season of Stand Alone Complex, though very nuanced and complex in its story, is in some parts boring as fuck. It had serious pacing issues and I am in no way a guy, who has to have action all the time, but the first season was in parts badly executed in my opinion. Also the Major only got her proper characterization in 2ndGIG. It felt like the writer didn't know what to do in season 1 with Motoko. I don't know, it really seemed off. Batou and Togusa were much more explored than the actual protagonist which was weird.

2nd GIG was the series the first season was supposed to be, its pacing was magnificent. You didn't have a single second to be bored (except ep2. What was that about?). I also really liked the SolidStateSociety.

I've never seen the Arise movies. Haven't gotten around to it yet.


The reason GitS isn't talked about as much as Evangelion and/or Cowboy Bebop is - and this may sound stupid - because it's a show for adults. While NGE and Cowboy Bebop are shows also much more appealing to adults than to teenagers, GitS is simply too meta and complex for a 15 year old to understand. NGE might also be too meta to be understood by someone who isn't able to write an essay about stuff, but even if so, you have the action in every episode to go with and the teenage characters to identify yourself with. GitS has none of those things. GitS isn't afraid to exclude action in an episode when it thinks it doesn't fit (which I admire ProdIG for making this decision). For someone who can't appreciate GitS as a story will find himself/herself bored fairly quickly with GitS. And the story (in the movies, as well as in the SAC series) is complex as fuck and delves deep into politics, philosophy, psychology and cyberpunk themes about the definition of life. GitS is an exclusively *adult* franchise and thus doesn't quite get the attention from a mostly rather young community. That's my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't think GiTS is an adult franchise. My first exposure to GiTS was during my teenage years and it is what essentially hooked me to the cyberpunk genre. While Bebop, EVA and GiTS are often lumped together, what sets GiTS apart from the other two is that GiTS is more exploratory in nature. Bebop is all about sharing the awesome story of the Bebop crew while EVA is all about Anno sharing his super depressed psyche to the audience. EVA and Bebop gave something to the audience, GiTS is more of an exploratory experience. 

I think the reason why many people after watching GiTS movie tend to drop the GiTS series is because the movie is a concentrated burst of everything awesome about cyberpunk that just leaves the watcher breathless, while the TV series is more of a slow burn, devoting more the exploratory nature of GiTS that it may bore people who have fond memories of the movie.

I'm all for it, although two episodes per day isn't feasible to me. Two per two, though, is perfectly fine if we can settle on that.  
I've been meaning to finish GitS, and this is the perfect opportunity. I feel this series is better experienced in small doses, and with plenty of discussion.

Haven't watched NGE and watched the subbed version of cowboy bebop recently(i prefer subs over dubs usually). Can anyone explain to me the appeal of Cowboy bebop? I usually enjoy almost all the anime i watch, but for some reason i was creeping through Cowboy Bebop, felt so boring, too episodic, and character development for the hacker girl? where was that... and she's gone before i cared... Is the appeal of Cowboy Bebop only present in the dubbed version?(which i heard was awesome, may rewatch it dubbed and see if i change my mind) Or did i miss something? didn't really care for that long haired bad guy, neither did i care for spike's relationship with that woman... what did i miss, i usually don't mind episodic anime but this one was hard to watch. I still decided to give it a 8/10(peer pressure) although imo(atleast the subbed) deserves nothing more than a 7. So please, tell me, do i have to watch it dubbed to enjoy the series to its fullest and see this masterpiece everyone claims it to be? P.S. I rate my anime based on my enjoyment watching said anime.

Am I the only one that felt like this wasn't the greatest thing ever? The movies were more like art and it's own thing, definitely not "anime" in the way I think of it (like Ghibli movies). 


GiTS SAC was a great anime no doubt, but I wouldn't call it groundbreaking or influential like Cowboy Bebop or Evangelion simply because the original movie did it first and much better. It played off of themes from the movie and drew them out over 2 seasons in a much more "anime" (and less original) way. 


Great series, but i think it gets overhyped a bit much here.

Hell ya! GitS is so influential on modern cyberpunk. Matrix trilogy is a the child born if GitS have sex with I, Robot. Every time I see a cyberpunk genre show, movie or story dealing with the future of networking, AI, consciousness, individuality, war and conflict, inevitably I will see the themes explored by GitS. And they usually pale in the exploration of these themes against GitS.

The original movie and Arise seem like two different series all together. If I think of them that way, I can enjoy Arise. But thinking of them as the same characters, it doesn't work. The original had a certain charm to it that Arise never captured.

I've seen both and I can say that when it comes to storytelling it literally is the same. Only thing changed is some key visuals like most  made up graphics etc. People can pick which one they like the most by literally just watching first 5 mins from each since it portrays pretty well how it will be for the rest of the movie.

it's the only anime you really need to see. the film is light years ahead of anything else, but SAC is good too if you don't mind the pandering nature that plagued a lot of series that came out in the early 2000's. glad people are paying attention to it again. it's pretty important stuff that drops the big swords and tedious monologues in favor of some real introspective.

Ghost in the Shell and Evangelion are good, but they're definitely not in my top 5, probably not even my top 10. There are many others that I find to be better examples of excellent story-telling. Cowboy Bebop is a top 10 anime though for sure.

Ghost in the Shell is without a doubt a high quality show in both content and production, but it aims heads and shoulders above the average anime demographic. It is perhaps the furthest outlier in the entire anime genre, so it's no real surprise to see it rarely come up in conversations since it isn't exactly something that can be casually brought up in basic forum topics and threads other for people to say "Oh yeah, it's definitely good." 

Its low accessibility isn't inherently a bad thing, nor is its absence from places like this due to the nature of what kinds of threads are always popping up. The show doesn't compare well to the bulk of anime so it naturally won't be brought up in comparison to many of them.

Standalone complex is still my favorite series to this day, I just wish there were more like it.

I'm in the middle of watching SAC but so far I'm not hooked by it, I liked the movies better, maybe it is the horrible German dub (don't judge me I'm watching this with my mother and her English isn't good enough for english dub or sub, and I can't find a German sub anywhere) but I'm gladly joining in at the discussions, because I'm interested in the thoughts of the other people exspecially of the movies.

[Well this sure as hell wasn't by accident](http://i.imgur.com/9TQpYnq.png), considering they make it [abundantly clear several times.](http://i.imgur.com/BMnDEVd.png)

What does it mean? That Batou is Kusanagi's savior? While he does save her they went full Jesus for him.

The Major was in the middle of talking about people she can confide in. *Cuts to Batou bearing a cross*

But why? They're likening Batou to Jesus and I have no idea what it could mean. Anybody have any thoughts?

Anyways, in the dub, Aramaki says "*They have no nuclear weapons! That story was fabricated by you and Goda of the Cabinet intelligence service.*"

Hmmm....sounds familiar.

Great ending. RIP you lovable spider-like AI's.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't necessarily have to be Jesus it could be [Simon of Cyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_of_Cyrene). In the episode they are planning on committing mass suicide by uploading their memories to cyberspace. This can be interpreting as sending them to heaven. To do this however, Makoto has to clear space for them there and by doing this she is averting the Tachikomas from actually helping her thereby in a way sacrificing herself to send all the refugees to heaven. My interpretation is that here Makoto is a Jesus character while Batou is Simon who sympathizes with the Jesus character and carries his (her) cross to help him, since he doesn't want Makoto to upload on her own.
>> ARTICLE
I think they did it only to make the scene look more badass. I see no relation between Batou and Jesus, because I don't think Major needs any saviour.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree. I think it's just there for effect because thematically it wouldn't really make sense. The Major is more than self-sufficient. 
>> ARTICLE
Well in that moment she kinda did, since she couldn't free herself and neither could Kuze
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, but I don't think it was a situation serious enough to call Batou their saviour. Well, maybe in creators' minds, but it looks a bit silly to me. I'd rather not analyse it too thoroughly :p
>> ARTICLE
Could also be something of an allusion to him "saving" her (in the future) from being emotionally alone in life.

Then again, could be another case of Rule Of Cool combined with Faux Symbolism.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention the woman-giving-a-man-an-apple imagery.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... I think they got their religious imagery mixed up there lol. Leads me to believe it was just for cool.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't need to mean Batou is The Major's saviour. Carrying a cross can also be a  sign of personal suffering namely that the Major is the cross that he carries. Batou's relationship with the Major has certainly caused him a lot of emotional turmoil.
>> ARTICLE
> Kuze: Refugees with family members like that will have difficulty accepting this decision, I know. I expect they'll lose faith in me and leave Dejima of their own accord. 

> Motoko: But in a situation such as this one, the role of the leader is both invaluable and filled with uncertainty. When you're in a position where you required to lead many people, you're sometimes forced to make difficult decisions. *Don't worry, I'm sure those people will understand.* 

I very much doubt he's going to get a whole lot of "Oh, you guys are suiciding and I can't join in. No problem. We're going to haul ass back to the mainland. Thanks for all you've done Comrade." 

This is pretty much the only thing that bothers me in the finale, even though I understand why it's there. This is Motoko letting her unresolved feelings for Kuze cloud her judgement, not helped 

> Proto: I don't believe it... Do you want to know something? I bet anything that all of you have Ghosts.

And goodbye once more Tachikomas. You weren't the thinktanks Japan deserved. But you were the thinktanks it needed.

> Kayabuki: I'll put an end to this situation my own way ... National independence through personal independence. I like to think that I have acted in accordance with that ideal ever since I took office. Just as it always has, my administration will pursue a policy of independent action and UN reconciliation. I intend to maintain an equal distance from the American Empire, the Ameri-Soviet Union, and China, as well as Asia and the nations of the EU. 

This ... is kind of a big deal. Really big. An outright rejection of Article 9 of Japan's constitution which had effectively neutered its political power during WWIII and WWIV. 

Politically, Takakura wasn't very shrewd. He had political capital, but he was short sighted by his endgame of fostering a post-refugee Cold War to boost the Japanese military economy. And his sexism led him to underestimate Kayabuki's political acumen.

Gouda played the game as well as he could have. He was clever and ruthless. And thank god he got his comeuppance. But the real villain of the piece turned out to be the CIA of the American Empire. 

> Watanabe: If the vassal state is negligent in its services, the starvation of the consumer state is inevitable. Manpower shortages always gives the slave manufacturing industries a boost, but if you're too strident in the assertion of rights, the arteries of capitalism will harden. 

> Gouda: In its mind, this country has always considered itself a capitalist state, but in reality, it's a virtual paragon of socialism. Although when waste matter builds up in the arteries, brains are needed to manage the blood's distribution. With its claims of liberty and security, I'm sure it's the same in your country. 

> Watanabe: Of course! But what we do behind closed doors are different matters. Ha,ha,ha. 

They were fully prepared to commit mass murder by nuclear attack under the guise of war. They sponsored a coup in the country to create better political conditions for their own, given Japan's stronger position as the holder of the Japanese Miracle. And they again violated the country's sovereign rights by assassinating an already captured Kuze.

> Sato: You really are a fascinating person, to be sure. However we view you as a dangerous element. Your country has no need of charismatic leaders that can't be controlled. Docile consumers, that's the way to go. 

I choose to believe Kuze began his upload before the Tachikomas sacrifice and managed to upload his consciousness to the net before his physical body died.
>> ARTICLE
> I choose to believe Kuze began his upload before the Tachikomas sacrifice and managed to upload his consciousness to the net before his physical body died.

It seems to me he could have had his own destination space set up and ready for a long time, and could have pulled the trigger on it while lying there on the floor folding that last crane.
>> ARTICLE
Tachikomas' deaths sadden me, but their sacrifice can be seen as the final step towards achieving their Ghosts. I love the uppity songs they sing every time they want to say goodbye, you just know they can't be machines going to their deaths while singing about departure. Moving moment.

Proto being a biodroid from the previous episode didn't affect me at all, probably because I didn't have time to start feeling attached to him. Tachikomas were the MVPs.

Gohda and the Cabinet Secretary... I don't know, their plan was so convoluted and roundabout. I still don't know what Gohda wanted to gain from his plot aside from a certain sense of... achievement? He's a queer villain. Unclear with his motivations, and thus even difficult to hate.

I think the ending was just ok when it came to resolving the plot, some things remained unspecified and generally the whole show seemed to follow the principle of 'if you can't explain, make it difficult to understand.' I'm not saying I didn't like it, in fact I found it great, but it's a major gripe that I had. The ending was certainly thrilling, that's for sure. I'm torn between rating the show 8 or 9 for that reason.
>> ARTICLE
> I still don't know what Gohda wanted to gain from his plot aside from a certain sense of... achievement? He's a queer villain.

That's exactly what he wanted. He had a massive inferiority complex and wanted to feel validated.

Recall a few episodes ago that he disclosed to Batou that he was a virgin, and that one of the triggers for the Individual 11 virus was that the infected person had to be a virgin.

Gouda's one of those basement-dwelling losers who happens to have a powerful government job.

> Tachikomas' deaths sadden me

It made me sad too so I rewatched that bit a couple of times and I [noticed they made a file containing all their memories](http://i.imgur.com/xZROGVF.jpg), I assume to upload it onto the net. So maybe they didn't die yet.


I also watched the [Tachikoma days](http://i.imgur.com/4cs8VVI.png) for this episode and it sheds doubt on their death

[Motokoooooo!](http://webm.host/933d3/vid.webm)

[I assume ](http://i.imgur.com/zlzO41A.jpg) she's [talking about Batou](http://i.imgur.com/SK445w9.jpg)?

I'm not quite happy with how this ended, sure Goda got reckt (which was extremely satisfying to see) but there is no resolution to the whole Kuze/Motoko storyline and the refugee issue is back to square one (how would that even happen unless with a huge cover up, and even then the Japanese public is still going to hate the refugees for "threatening" to use a nuke).


Plus the Tachikoma are dead, I loved those little guys. At least they went out in a literal blaze of glory


Edit: now that I think about it the first season ended similarly, many things were left unresolved

Edit 2: Forgot to ask this but what did the Major mean by ["You're..."](http://i.imgur.com/ucHtoHy.jpg)?
>> ARTICLE
I as well wanted a better resolution with Motoko and Kuze; I felt empty the fact that Motoko never dared to ask if he was that dear friend of hers although many signs reminded her of who he is.


Not sure why another great anime ended. There can have been another season or two, either to go into china/asia or united states. Great plot, great characters, and loved the gloomy atmosphere.

I took that conversation as them figuring out each was the other from their childhood.

In terms of the character interactions and development, I felt it was a bit lacking. I usually don't think it's a necessary aspect to a story, but this one in particular left me wanting so much more, specifically with Motoko, Kuze and Batou. Also, those new Section 9 outfits in the end are terrible. 

Anyway, can someone explain what was up with that apple-hugging scene, and what the Major realized when Kuze was able to take a bite out of it?

First, the soundtrack was literally perfect and well timed. We get vintage batou with another Motoko!!!

Wish there was more..

Togusa, why didn't you just disarm him? *Not literally?* Goddammit, that was irritating. He said himself that disarming the opponent is the first thing to do, and yet he left the guy's gun in his hand. He can basically feel responsible for that woman's death.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I like Togusa. This incident simply had to happen as a setting for this episode's trial, if we look at it from narrative point of view. Though if we don't, he did fuck up badly.
>> ARTICLE
I think Pazu handles their inquiries into Yakuza-esque case work. You always see him in underbelly clubs and dens when they're out doing footwork.
>> ARTICLE
So, Motoko hijacked Togusa right?  When exactly did she do that?
>> ARTICLE
I think it was as soon as she closed her eyes, she might have prepared a ghost key (whatever that is) beforehand but I doubt that she would do something like that (she's not batman), she's just extremely proficient at hacking
>> ARTICLE
Because he started to talk out of his sense of justice and wouldn't accept communications from Section 9 members present in the court. Motoko turned the trial in his favour by basically blackmailing the D.A. and the defendant's lawyer, using the information she has just dug up during a recess.

Edit: oh, you asked *when*. Nevermind, then.
>> ARTICLE
So Togusa's wife doesn't know?  She's subject to the security-company cover story too?
>> ARTICLE
Togusa's family is likely the reason all of it was cooked up in the first place. Aside from Motoko's girlfriends, we never see anybody any of the members could possibly reveal information to. I'm sure they have people they're close to, but Togusa is the only person who would have someone being nosy when things get stressful.
>> ARTICLE
>security-company cover story

How did you know that they were using a cover story? I must've missed when this was revealed.

Edit: I re-watched the episode. I think it's best I give every episode a second or third watch just to make sure I understand it.
>> ARTICLE
This is common practice in numerous current day black-ops groups. Kind of sad, but I understand it's importance in regards to their safety
>> ARTICLE
Really, it's common even for non-black ops. 

For example, even joining the CIA as a clerical worker or translator, decidedly *not* shady operations side, the CIA has very strict rules about how much you reveal to spouses, friends, and family. 

>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I'm not sure I like Section 9 dealing out vigilante justice. Since last season they seem to work a lot more outside of the law (and by that I don't mean black ops but completely illegal actions taken for personal reasons). They seem to be heading into rogue territory and though they are somewhat justified in doing so (with Goda manipulating behind the scenes) if we didn't have an inside view of Section 9 but an outside view I'm not sure we would see them as good guys. 
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty funny to see Section 9 complaining in the recent episodes about too much government oversight, and then have them go off and pull a stunt like this.
>> ARTICLE
This episode frustrates me to no end and I love it. Togusa, you beautifully naive, self-righteous idiot...
>> ARTICLE
All in all I prefer the flow of this season, I was not always able to differentiate between individual/dividual/dual episodes, which made for a much more cohesive plot. But I do find The Laughing Man a lot more memorable and interesting (in large part due to how mysterious The Laughing Man's story was, which made me wonder each episode when we would find out more) than Kuze or Goda.


I think that if I were to watch either one of the series again I would choose the second season because I already know who The Laughing Man is now and without that drive I think the episodes will be less fun to watch (plus some of the stand alone episodes were not that interesting). 


My favorite episode this season was the one where Saito recounts how he met the Major.


I said this for the last episode as well but I would have preferred some closure on the Motoko/Kuze storyline but after thinking about it some more I think they just accepted that they were no longer the same people they were then.

In the end the characters that had in my opinion the most development/change during the season seem to be the Tachikoma.

I forgot watching the [Tachikoma days](http://i.imgur.com/LNsvjfx.png) except for the one for the last episode so I'll be doing that now.


There is not much else I have to say except that I'm looking forward to Solid State Society (I'm hoping the Tachikoma will make a comeback)


Edit: I just finished watching Tachikoma Days so here is a [shitty gif](https://i.imgur.com/340QqWB.gif) for everyone who is still watching with us
>> ARTICLE
Agree. Overall, this season was a definite and surprising improvement over the already great first season. The pacing was better. The narrative was more structured. And the stand alone type episodes were, for the most part, stronger as well.

That said, neither Kuze or Gouda's cases were as engaging as the Laughing man. It took until things really started going south, the nuclear deal and war with the refugees, until the case really came together. They were great. But they were high minded affairs. More political and philosophical than the more immediately engaging mystery of the Laughing Man hacker and the phenomena that followed him. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the narrative benefited from having more clearly defined antagonists and letting them push Section 9 to their absolute limit. And I'd say Gouda and Kuze were just as charismatic as the Laughing Man. 

Favorite episodes:

* "Poker Face"
* "Natural Enemy"
* "Trans Parent"
* "239 Pu"
* "Reversal Process" for that great conversation between Batou and Gouda

>> ARTICLE
The "dividual" episodes felt a lot more relevant to the overarching plot, whereas in the first season some of the stand alone episodes just felt weak and disconnected.  I think the only episode that didn't have any obvious tie-in was the episode with the blind girl and the terrorist father.  The quality of the season overall was much more consistent, and the climax was even more hype than last season's.

The thing I really like more about this season, aside from the much more cohesive plot and integration of filler eps into the main story, was the bigger stakes at play. The Laughing Man storyline was largely about a political scandal and a politician's efforts to cover it up. 2nd GIG went way bigger than that. I recall I may as well have shit my pants when they revealed an American nuclear sub was detected outside Japanese waters about to nuke Dejima.
>> ARTICLE
Thus was my second time watching this, and I think I got a better understanding what was going on. An imperfect major, charismatic terrorist, and an enemy from within. Stand alone complex is an easier watch, but 2nd gig is better imo. 
>> ARTICLE

I didn't have much love for Arise, and it aired so recently I'm not sure there is great call for a rewatch.

I feel bad for that poor girl, I wish Batou had pretended to be her father, even just for a bit. I'm reminded again of this [picture from S1E16](https://i.imgur.com/kSq6NZ8.jpg) and I wonder if he would want to have a family.


For episodes like this I always hope there'll be a followup where we find out more about what happened, is the girl's condition related to her dad becoming a terrorist? What is going to happen to her now?

You reminded me, it was kind of amusing that he quipped about dogs not liking him, given the events of the movies.

More adventures in foreign lands.  I always find these interesting.  It puts our heroes off balance a bit.

I gotta wonder why Angel's Feathers' daughter was blind and reliant on a sighted wheelchair instead of having prosthetic eyes, especially given how much of a prosthetic enthusiast dad seems to be.

This episode shows Production I.G. pulling out all the stops. The detail on all the characters is better. The writing seems a little tighter. We even get a worthy rival to best girl Motoko in the form of Prime Minister Yoko Kayabuki. There's also some nice porn of them together, if you're into that sort of thing. **Which I am because I am a dirty, dirty man.**

The Major also makes a joke about [taking the guys out to a nudey bar](http://i.imgur.com/cYanmPn.jpg), all with a big smile on her face.

We learn about Section 9 getting new recruits, whom we'll meet later.

We get to learn a bit about the situation in Japan. After World War 3, a lot of countries needed rebuilding, including Japan. To get things done, they hired thousands of refugees. Now, though, there are people who want the refugees out. This is a big thing, especially given Japan's historically... "funny" reaction to foreigners.

I detect a hint of resentment on Togusa's part. He seems like he's still a little bitter about the finale of Season 1, though one can hardly blame him given how shut out he was during the whole thing.

We also get a small glimpse of realism here; Batou's gun jams and he tries to clear it in the middle of the fight.

We get two callbacks here: Batou again tackles a suspect just like in Season 1. We also get the whole "disappearing down a skyscraper" thing from the original film.

Personally, I feel the new OP is a definite upgrade. However, I prefer "Litium Flower" for the ED from season one.

In regards to both the new OP and ED, I completely agree. I love the new OP but the original ED is way better.

Yeah, poor Togusa, he basically lost his faith in the Chief since Sections 9's whole shtick was complete honesty/backing from Aramaki.  In fact Togusa's entire character arc can be summed up as him getting more and more cynical.

You can think all you want. But Motoko's identity is not for you to randomly made up to suit yourself. I need to be snappy because I have too many responses like this already. Too many insisting that she can't really be a woman because she is too competent, to strong, to brave. And when I pull out all the examples in the script in every universe, people like you dismiss it. Even SAC mentioned her phantom periodpain at one point. I expect you to disregard facts like everyone else before who believed the same thing, so I will end it here and you are free to ignore what I just told you.

So for this season the episode codes have changed. Similar to breaking down the phrase "Stand Alone Complex" for the first season codes, 2nd GIG breaks down the word "Individual" to create three meanings.

* **IN** - Despite the initially contradictory seeming title, **Individual** episodes will act as the new Complex type episodes and work to drive the primary story ahead. You should think of the "in" prefix of the word to mean that it can't be divided from the whole body of the season, rather than its typical meaning of not being able to be split apart from itself. I believe this is also the intended meaning in the name of this season's leading antagonists, the Individual 11.

* **DI** - **Dividual** episodes are stand alone pieces. These can be divided from the whole with little consequence.

* **DU** - This season also has a third type, **Dual**, which focus more on a second storyline that runs alongside the first. Dual here would mean that these episodes exist as a sort of hybrid between Individual and Dividual.

Plot elements from each primary story tie together in both the Individual and Dual episodes. You should consider each type as important as the other to the season overarching plot. Dividual episodes are skippable for the most part, but like in the first season there are many that reinforce the themes and character arcs of across the 26 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, while the Dividual episodes are technically stand alone, the tighter overarching plot of 2nd Gig means they tie in better to the main plot than season 1's stand alone episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I was wondering whether the "Dividual" at the beginning of the episode was a typo or not.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, it's kind of strange this episode is listed as DI rather than IN. I guess it reinforces a policy of not skipping the side stories.
>> ARTICLE
Season 2 is off to a cracking start. 

A group calling itself the Individual 11 has taken over the Chinese Embassy and 10 or so hostages. They intend to demand the closure of the Asian refugee centers which have come to be since the end of the 4th World War however police jamming has so far prevented them from doing so. In an ironic twist the new government intended to announce their intentions to do just that in their next policy speech however can no longer do so as it will appear as if they are caving to the terrorist's demands. Aramaki uses this crisis to push through a new budget that would allow Section 9 to function officially once more. 

Already Ghost in the Shell is diving back into intense and complicated subjects. This season is far more political than the last and the refugee crisis discussion brings up a lot of points I've been hearing in the news these days particularly the fear of rising unemployment being exacerbated by waves of poverty stricken immigrants. The alleged motives of the Individual 11 are not so far removed from some of the more extreme rhetoric I've seen throw around lately. The Cabinet discussion was suitably complex and demonstrated that Section 9 still walks a tight line and that the new prime minister is no fool.  

It's a great start to the season, Section 9 kicking ass was great to see and even though Season 1 looked pretty gorgeous Season 2 looks even better.  

Oh and the Tachikomas are back!!

It sets up the backdrop and shows what the team does. Everyone has their role (except Borma, forever bald), and this is their little moment of fun. It portrays them as a competent team ready to take on anything.

I also loved the political side of things. Government bureaucracy is the worst villain ever, and even they were intelligent, if not overly helpful.

It's a shame right in the middle of all the fun there was a bit of an exposition overload, because I don't even think they needed it. It feels like there were a ton of times in this series in which the Japanese writers wanted to be overly fancy, and translators were afraid to take too many liberties. It works great for Tachikoma side conversations, but it doesn't work out too well when they're discussing individualism, imo.

If more stories could handle action sequences this well I would be a much happier man. (Not every battle should be a blowout, but characters should be portrayed as competent.) They didn't need to spend five minutes explaining how brains are hacked, they just showed it.

I tend to prefer the episodes that have fewer action sequences and are more mystery oriented, but that's because I tend to be a plot oriented person. I still enjoy the action episodes, but they just don't scratch the same itch.

Heh, which word triggered the spam filter this time? :p

I like it so far. A continuation of the previous season. Section 9 is as good as always and Tachikomas are baaack! Today's episode: Die Hard, GitS version.

Section 9 - Now Hiring!

And holy crap I wasn't expecting more background on Motoko.  It took me a little while before I realized it was her.  So now we know what caused her to get a prosthetic body so young.
>> ARTICLE
Finally we find out why the major had a full prostethic body at a young age and boy what a story it is. I really liked this episode and the name "Affection" is extremely fitting. The way the old full prostethics bodies look really resembles dolls.
I wonder why Motoko disappeared from the hospital though. And also what exactly that "shop" is supposed to be, is it a physical place where she suddenly disappeared to or was she, and Batou and everyone else in the area hacked? Very mysterious

Also I'm 99% sure we'll see the boy again later, Batou is going to have some competition in the future
>> ARTICLE
I didn't remember this episode being this feelsy.  Misted up a bit at that "only boy she ever loved" line.

Gotta wonder how the shopkeep knew that whole story from all the angles, though.  And about how the Major got disconnected when she went near.
>> ARTICLE
I was never that crazy about them giving us explicit backstory on the Major rather than leaving her past mysterious, but I've come around on this episode on rewatch. It definitely benefits from the viewer knowing the complete story.

Presumably the boy's adult self left his memories with the shopkeeper, that's the whole point of the shop, isn't it? 
>> ARTICLE
Right, but she seemed to know things the boy specifically never knew
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how much of this conversation is actually the woman speaking and how much are Motoko's own memories. Maybe she imagined the whole conversation.

Hm, you have a point.  

Or perhaps these were realizations that the boy came to later (mainly that the girl was the one who was comatose, right?)
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't hold back and marathoned the whole season. 

Yeah, this was one of my favorite episodes - there's so much backstory, and it makes Motoko just that more human (even though the story is technically about becoming less human :p). 

For those of you new to the series... Keep this one in the back of your head!

Nostalgic moment for the major. At first I thought she was hacked, but I guess she randomly stumbled into that area and found those prosthetic bodies. Nice to have more background info on kusanagi

Agreed with the other guy, it's a rather large spoiler. Subtly hinted before, but I wouldn't expect most people to connect the dots (I didn't) until a couple of episodes later. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice catch, but I'd consider that to be a pretty big spoiler. But yeah theres no real explanation for this episode is there? The major said she was feeling nostalgia before she entered the shop, as if she knew what was coming, so maybe it wasn't real at all and it's meant to represent her ghost? Maybe your spoiler is what trigger her ghost to remember her past, while she typically thinks very little of it. It's still pretty random.
>> ARTICLE
I'm torn. I'd like to think that the shop and memories were real, and it was less memory manipulation than the residual psychic/ghost imprint of those particular objects calling to her. And the hacking effect is because of all the shop items being accumulated at one point.

From what I remember, clearly it was the best episode of the show.

I finally caught up to this rewatch after falling ridiculously far behind after the end of season 1. I fell behind like 2 weeks (the first 13-14) episodes and binged this week to catch up here, just as its all coming to a head. 

My thoughts thus far:

* I never thought I'd find an OP as good as "Inner Universe" in any show ever again let alone one in the exact same anime. "Rise" is as hype as it gets. 

* Is it just me or is the soundtrack this season noticeably more awesome? For sure the first season's was great but I've noticed how good this season's score is many more times. 

* My favorite part this season was early on when the Tachikoma's are discussing the monks and how they want to "download enlightenment." That was hilarious. The fact that they treat something so difficult to achieve, something that takes a lifetime of dedication and practice, as something they can easily get for themselves with the click of a button- that shows what we are seeing now with instant media and what we might see in the future with instant education. 

* Overall, I much prefer the story of this season as well as the stand alone episodes. There's just a greater sense of epicness overall and the ending is shaping up to be far  more climactic. 
>> ARTICLE
This season definitely took a level in soundtrack. Everything seems more cinematic with great additions like "Flying Low", "Europe", "The End of All You'll Know", "Torukia", "Know Your Enemy", and "Laser Seeker". 

I think the alternate OP ["Christmas in the Silent Forest"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBwwUfCVA0c) is the best OP of the lot. And ["Somewhere in the Silence"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofQTRgWcimY) is the best of the soundtracks.
>> ARTICLE
> Overall, I much prefer the story of this season as well as the stand alone episodes.

Same. I think it's because all the stand alone episodes relate or provide more information in some way to the main plot. Even if it's something as simple as the newspaper headline Batou read in Angel's Poem.
>> ARTICLE
If I'm following this, we have Batou using the Major's memories to distract Gouda while they lift the plutonium in order to test it for a match against the stuff that was recovered in that prior episode, which would pin the blame on Gouda and his CIS for staging the whole incident.  Still not quite sure what the deal was with that virginity talk near the end, though.

I'm pretty sure it means being a virgin is required for the Indiv. 11 virus to fully activate.
>> ARTICLE
Right, but why?
>> ARTICLE
Was he even being serious? I thought he was trolling.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure he was serious. And it was a bit of a gamble considering how fairly recent the full body prosthetic trend is. You're counting on targets meeting the following criteria:

* interested in and reads the fictional Individual Eleven
* has read the actual ten essay by Sylvester
* male, presumably since there were no female infections
* virgin before they were prostheticized 

>> ARTICLE
[But why male models?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHrn_pHW2so&user=gkaare)
>> ARTICLE
It isn't the only requirement. But its a crucial one. The chief goals of the behavioral virus are to (1) encourage fanatic terrorism against the refugees and (2) force martyrdom after the first objective is completed as to erase evidence of the virus. 

While it's definitely sadistic, choosing virginity, specifically men who were virgins before going full prosthetic, as a trigger makes a certain amount of sense. It leaves you with a target pool of emotionally and physically frustrated men who are on some level frustrated because they can never experienced organic, non-simulated sex. 

Just as going prosthetic doesn't stem the desire to eat and drink as one once used to, as seen in "Fake Food", going prosthetic doesn't erase the internalized, biological desire to mate or procreate. In this situation, even if you find sex in a prosthetic body fulfilling, as is implied with the Major, there must also be that niggling concern that what you're doing isn't the real deal or doesn't match the sensation of the original. It ties into the more general exploration of of depersonalization that the show explored through Kuze and the Major. Only sex is a more universal and immediate concern than the genuineness of one's consciousness.

Presumably, the ideological virus targets men with these traits who have happened to read all ten essays and when they read the fictional, virus-carrying eleventh essay, the virus manifests and twists the behaviors of the virus carriers by modeling their frustration and detachment from society into a self-righteous, ideological blade of vengeance. 

In a sense, you could point to real world for evidence, whether its self-righteous male youth recruited and propagandized into suicide bombing by Muslim terrorists or the scary number of American school shootings carried out by maladjusted young men who haven't received what female attention they feel their due.

I remember reading a very good essay on the idea following a couple of the shootings that have happened here this year, but can't seem to find it. A quick googling returns some similar results, so this is a correlation that [others have made and explored](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9780312239572). 

edit: Can't find the essay, but [this article](http://gloucesterclam.com/2015/10/04/the-shootings-are-not-senseless/) is pretty similar in tone and substance.

Who are the Individual 11? 

A seeming member of the "group" attempts to reenact the May 15th Incident which in 1932 involved a failed coup and murder of then Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi by 11 naval officers. It and the aftermath was a deadly blow to Japanese democracy that eroded the rule of law and led to the February 26th Incident. The assassin intends to recreate it by assassinating Prime Minister Kayabuki. It appears he is influenced by the works of a one Patrick Sylvester, a scholar of social movements and wannabe revolutionary. Of particular note is an unpublished essay titled "The Individual 11" a reference to the 11 officers who assassinated Tsuyoshi. The assassin fails, or maybe not as the Major comments, due to Section 9 however things are clearly only just beginning.

It seems we may have another Stand Alone Complex on our hands. The same calling card appears at unrelated crimes including the last episode's crisis. There's nothing to link the crimes save the cards and there is no hint that the refugees, who seem to be at the heart of the groups motivations, have ever organized in a group using the Individual 11 symbol. The attempted assassination comes in the wake of the announcement that the Special Refugee Policy will be revoked which angers many refugees. However the Individual 11 should, if it is indeed based around the May 15th Incident and the works of Sylvester, be an Ultra Nationalist movement and therefore in favour of revoking the policy. On the other hand the first group to use the moniker were those that took over the Chinese embassy and demanded an end to the policy. If this is a Stand Alone Complex then perhaps there is no coordinated ideological core and instead just a bunch of imitators who don't really know what they're imitating. 

Goda again seems on top of everything and is both only mildly surprised by events and supremely confident. 

Also I sympathize with Togusa and Ishkawa. Looking for hideously obscure academic writings is a hellish task.  

Oh and the Tachikomas discuss downloadable enlightnement. Sign me right on up.
>> ARTICLE
> There's nothing to link the crimes save the cards and there is no hint that the refugees, who seem to be at the heart of the groups motivations, have ever organized in a group using the Individual 11 symbol. 

I'm thinking that someone is actually leaving the cards after the fact and that none of the crimes are actually related, someone is trying to make the police think they are related by claiming responsibility, though I have no idea why. Though that theory doesn't really fit with the assassin from this episode or the terrorrists from the first episode, but it's the vibe I'm getting from what Aramaki and Togusa were saying + those guys in suits who left the card at the pilots home
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember if I ever knew about it before now or not, but that (real-life) story about the [May 15 Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_15_Incident) is pretty fucked up.  We might think modern Japan has a cultural problem or two, but prewar Japan was downright scary.
>> ARTICLE
The Japanese just kinda lost their marbles over the whole May 15th Incident. Weeping in the courtroom, Severed fingers, 350000 signatures in blood and a slap on the wrist sentence for the murder of the sitting PM all speaks to a society that had some serious issues. 

Of course it was all part of that growing hyper nationalist fervor that reached utterly insane proportions before and during the war. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode is pretty awesome. We get Gouda being his usual smarmy self. God, I just wanna kick that guy in the balls. If his body is anything like his face, though, maybe he doesn't have any.

Togusa stumbles on a clue here, though we won't see anything come of it in this episode.

The assassin here is pretty fucking scary. Not only is he able to keep the Major on her toes through sheer physical strength, but he takes something like 28 or 30 bullets between the Major and Batou and he barely flinches. He also busts through a roof and leaps off into the difference much like Section 9's cyborgs or Tachikoma might.
>> ARTICLE
I love tachikoma. "download enlightenment" lol.  But Goda... Who exactly is he. He's able to gather info on somewhat classified info rather easily,and he is now running a separate operation with the same objective as section 9. Reinforced cyborg huh, dude was tough. Not sure what the major meant by saying the assassin may have not been trying to kill the PM 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the Major was was reprimanding the PM through a sarcastic statement along the lines of 'you wanted to come here alone and we barely saved you'.

I'm pretty sure the assassin wanted to make a big show out of killing her, making his face known before he swung.
>> ARTICLE
Goda is head of the Cabinet Intelligence Service. They deal in the collection, analysis and manipulation of information particularly information related to foreign policy. 

The Major seems to have meant that the assassin was trying to make a statement of some kind perhaps saying that he could have easily killed the PM had he wanted to. She suspects this due to the fact that he clearly could have managed it but made a big show of uncloaking and striking a pose instead.
>> ARTICLE
He's a head of a division, not the whole agency. 
>> ARTICLE
True, not to mention those bullets didn't really have an effect. Thanks for the reply 
>> ARTICLE
The whole refugee affair is a bit complicated. Does the Prime Minister want to restrict the laws for the refugees or make them more lax by repealing the previously enforced bill? It's difficult to say, can someone clarify please? The Individual Eleven from the 1st episode seemed to be an anti-refugee movement. As to today's antagonist, I'm not so sure.

The cyborg assassin never opens his mouth when he speaks. I wonder if it has any significance.

Also, I've just noticed that Gouda appears for a blink in the opening, so he's probably going to be rather important this season.
>> ARTICLE
On your question about the PM, from what I got from the little news bit at the beginning, 

"Objection is mounting against a course of action considered rash, because it relies on radical legal reforms not yet in place."

"These reforms could prevent refugees who are faced with losing their current jobs from finding future employment and obtaining passports."

It sounds like the reforms are based around getting refugees to work. If they lose their job, and become unemployed, they might not get another job, or get a passport. There are similar policies that are being argued for in the US in regards to undocumented immigrants, and in Europe regarding the refugee crisis right now. A "path to citizenship", if you will. Without getting into the politics surrounding that, these policies are generally not popular with refugees and immigrants, due to increased requirements for citizenship that make the process longer, among other things.

I thought the Eleven were pro refugee, and against the PMs "rash reforms". 

And on the baddie, I'm not sure what his motive is. I think the would-be assassin was using a katana, as well as basing his whole plot and setup on the 1930s nationalistic revolution of Japan. This leads me to believe he and the Eleven intend to repeat history and spur on nationalism, but in his little bit where he was going on a rant about the PM while sitting in a dark room, he said;

"Having to pay lip-service for a brief time to the liberation of the refugees while at the same time doing nothing about it. I will spur you on by meting out a punishment you so richly deserve." 

Then he goes on another rant about motives and ideals. I think it's easier to see when looking back at the episode again, but I think he is pro-refugee, and that he never intended to kill the PM, just force her to take action with the refugees.

Hope that helps!
>> ARTICLE
It's been awhile since I've watched but I've been recently reminded of the series.  

As far as I know, Gouda is ultra-nationalistic, though he enjoys manipulating and... 'serving' Japan from the shadows.  In regards to the refugees, he would prefer that they don't exist as he believes they are a burden to Japan, a Japan that can't say 'No.'  (Shades of the crazy real-life ex-Tokyo govenor Ishihara here.)

When he and other ultra-nationalists like the Individual Eleven want independence for the refugees it is merely to try and cut them away from Japan.  "Let them deal with their own mess," is more their philosophy.  In thinking so, they declare that the refugees should do things by themselves and be independent of Japan, all the while knowing that the refugees aren't capable of being independent.  (For example where will they get food?  There's no arable land there.)

And in the Individual Eleven's case, sabotaging the refugee's hopes and chances are also on the order, to burn the candle of Refugee failure on both ends, so to speak.

In this story, and as with a lot of ultra-nationalist strategies in the world today and in history, their tactic is to prove that some group of people are inferior, weak, immoral, etc., in order to justify harsh action against them, anywhere from ostracization up to genocide.

I still think it is kind of odd that they keep introducing themselves as section 9 since the unit got scrapped and rebuilt a few months later, is the general public just okay with that? No one is questioning what the hell the government is doing outlawing a specific secret agency then after a few months bringing it back under the same name, leadership and with the same members? Also they never even need to show identification (or do all police have something in their cyberbrain that allows them to recognize "friendlies"?)

They weren't supposed to exist before the incident, either.  But keeping the same name is a bit of a ballsy move, yeah.  Possibly a case of making a big public show of doing one thing and then in reality, quietly doing another, and anyone who knows how these things work is of course not surprised, so they go about their jobs without taking exception.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, they're introducing themselves to other sections, not the public. Just as with press blackouts that keep their name out of the media, I'm sure they have an agreement with other agencies that keeps Section 9 secretive.
>> ARTICLE
I think the lack of providing ID, and not dealing with Section 9's public perception, is an example where GitS rates the flow of it's narrative above internal consistency. In another example, I talked a few threads ago about how Togusa's actions were more heavily governed by his role as a viewer-insert than as a professional detective. These things are as they are because the episodes need to work as a story before anything else. 

I get annoyed when I spot this stuff, but I generally think they were perfectly capable of siding with internal consistency if they chose to. It doesn't change that they're a shortcoming. But, I don't mind so much as I understand the complications that arise during production of any kind of story in the video medium. If they couldn't work some aspects in without it feeling clunky then I am glad to have it left on the floor.

Not speaking about GitS: the whole not giving ID trope is really really common and it annoys the hell out of me every time it comes about. "Who the hell are you to barge into my crime-scene?" "The protagonist, step aside."

Pazu, you dun goofed and stuck your dick in crazy.  Now two people (or more?) are dead, plus you lost a lead on Kuze.

How did Paz's ex obtain that body? There was talk about the face-sculptor, but we see a scene with a woman removing a body (the one that looks like Paz's?) from storage and... making love to it? Also, there was someone's cyberbrain being disposed. How does it come together?

EDIT: OK, I rewatched these scenes. It seems Paz's ex had hacked a prosthetic body of a random woman and it was already her who visited Paz at the bar. She had contacted the face sculptor and made him construct or refit another body for her, looking exactly like Paz's. The scene in which she takes off her clothes and lies on the body is probably the moment when she switched bodies for the last time. She then disposed of the redundant braincase of the woman she had hijacked and went to meet Paz. It took me watching it twice to get it right.

What an episode.

A anti-tank helicopter (Jigbachi) pilot dies mid training exercise however the support AI refuses orders to return to base and hacks several other helos which proceed to circle the radio tower in one of the refugee districts. Section 9 are called in by Kazundo Goda, head of the Cabinet Intelligence Service bearing a unique name and face to match, to handle the situation.

Section 9 find themselves in the uncomfortable situation of being at the call of another government agency and we see Batou's distrust of authority. Goda gives them suspiciously accurate information to work with and they, though none too happy, preform excellently to resolves the situation and prevent a potential crisis arising from powder keg that is the refugees. Elsewhere Togusa and Ishkawa investigate the pilots residence. They miss the calling card of the suspicious agents. Seems the Jigbachi incident was no accident. Something big is coming into play and Goda for his part clearly knows more than he is letting on and has no problem with Section 9 knowing it.    

This is such a great episode. The action is on point, the music is stellar (Cyberbird omg...) and the twist and turns are only getting started.

Just one failure mode of autonomous armed AIs that one can easily envision:  failsafes that turn into faildangerouses.  Though I am curious how and why it decided to *hack others*.  Seems like going above and beyond its mission to maintain till further orders, not to mention way past its pay grade to be that smart.

Meanwhile this new guy comes along and smells a lot like a puppetmaster that even Section 9 dances for.

Side note:  I was starting to think the Tachikomas were permanently wheel-less in the second season.  I forget if they ever show the transition between wheels and foot-pads.

Someone listed a lot of parallels between the original 1995 _GitS_ movie and _The Matrix_.  This one seems like it returned the favor:  the Major on a rooftop, struggling to pull back a helicopter at the end of a tether.

>Side note: I was starting to think the Tachikomas were permanently wheel-less in the second season. I forget if they ever show the transition between wheels and foot-pads.

I think the wheels and footpads are the same mechanism, and that there is no transition between them. While it would make more sense for them to use the wheels as wheels a lot more frequently than they tend to, the animation of them padding around like giant spider children is a lot more expressive. The Tachikoma are one area where the show allows style (rather than practicality) to dictate how events are communicated to the viewer.

Here's a scary idea: a machine that works with a human being and the human being dies. Here's an AI  that says PARTY TIME the moment it isn't supervised and its sister units follow. It turns out the pilot was the issue, though, as destroying his brain is the only way to get the AI to reboot.

We also get a look at a rather pretentious character who's [fuck ugly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZBSno9aLQ). Oh, no no no. That's not how you pronounce my name. It's read like THIS. Barf.

We see some extra cynicism on Batou's part this time around. He doesn't think the government has the unit's best interests in mind. Nobody can blame him considering that the last time he got on its bad side, he got shot at.

Something that's always bothered me is that the Major is able to stop the helicopter in its tracks. Even being a super-reinforced cyborg, she shouldn't have the mass

To be fair, Japanese writing has high numbers of homophones, so knowing what word or pronunciation you're looking at is highly dependent on context. So I assume if you have an uncommon name, you have to keep correcting people's pronunciation of it, kinda like spelling for western languages, especially english.  

Still Gouda's one of my favorite characters because he's a smug bastard who never stops being a smug bastard (same reason why I like Makishima from Psycho Pass).

Tokyo got proper fucked in WWW3. Reduced now to a shanty town and a vast condemned area with minor demolition work ongoing for decades. There's street markets, decrepit housing, poverty stricken people and even neon signs.  

We get to see a side of Ghost in the Shell we don't normally get and that is of the marginalized poor. They live beyond the sight of everyday citizens in grim conditions, don't have access to decent medical care and cyberization, are desperate for work and willing to trade out their bodies for corp provided ones if given the chance. They are easily exploited with little chance at a future. This is one of the clearer examples of just how dystopic Ghost in the Shell's Japan is.

Togusa gets deep into the murder of a man blackmailing of the Energy Ministry only to find out that they are covertly excavating a nuclear reactor in the flooded district. Their motives for doing so are unknown and the use of off the books labour and disappearing people indicates that all isn't right and proper. Seems that Goda's Cabinet Intelligence Service is involved in keeping it hush hush by removing difficult people.  

There isn't a happy ending here and it's clear that something big is going on even though Togusa can't see the whole of it yet. 
>> ARTICLE
(Some difficulty today, /u/UltraKillex ?)

The plot thickens.  And we get another facet of the cyberization phenomenon, this time economic.  Those who can afford the better tools tend to get the better paying jobs, as it has always been  the haves get more and the have-nots struggle.

I feel bad for that poor woman, though.  Clearly a good person who doesn't deserve all the shit life has been dealing her.  Nearly took a turn for the ugly were it not for Togusa being around, too.

So why did seeing the newspaper startle Togusa? What was written on it that made him call the girl?

The picture is of the guy that led them to the entrance.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, so he died or something? And that made Togusa think that they were covering their tracks?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what the paper actually says, but presumably he suddenly went missing.  If you didn't notice, there were men in black suits overlooking the entrance.

Yeah I noticed that but I didn't recognize the guy in the newspaper at first, I thought it was Botan

[This pretty sums up how I feel](http://i.imgur.com/R6zuko6.jpg) whenever they get deep into philosophy.

Hm.  As a computer guy, this new Tachikoma AI-in-the-sky architecture disturbs me.

* The satellite is a single point of failure.  Take it out or block it and the Tachikomas lose AI (or all?) functionality.
* Unless they've invented faster-than-light communications, that altitude presents a pretty formidable extra round-trip time added to the mix.

Dr. Asuda went about his defection plan pretty dumbly, though.  If he'd just quietly slipped away with no explosion, or waited for some foreign conference, no one would have noticed till it was too late.

In other news, the Major should wear [this outfit](http://i.imgur.com/ETc9pLn.jpg) more often.  Hubba.
>> ARTICLE
Gosh, that was the longest Tachikoma special ever. A bit too heavy on the metaphysical side, but also funny at times. The robots never fail to crack me up, like when they panicked that they had no brains :D Turns out they practically live in space. Oh, well. I'm a little envious.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked that episode. I've been interested in sociology for a while, and have researched it (albeit very lightly), so this episode was one of my favorites. The sociological examinations of the Tachikomas, and their deciphering of their sense of self was really well done. I think by this point it's possible to say that they really do have ghosts. With their increased individuality, I think it's a cool idea to think of them as a multi-celled organism. They all have an individuality, but are almost one part of a whole, especially with their disposition towards syncing data and sharing experiences with each other.

Another really cool part was the possible sociological "third self" that they discussed. The idea that cyberisation, as well as the net, cause society to form a more cohesive whole, is pretty interesting. It's really just a more tangible interpretation of what mile Durkheim (a founding father of Sociology) called collective consciousness (the idea that society is a separate, unreachable "entity" of sorts, that is unchangeable by a single individual, but rather, changes on it's own over time). 

A lot of this episode seemed influenced by Durkheim, actually. With the analysis of individuals and their - mostly nonexistent - effect on society as a whole, it paralleled his work pretty accurately, I think.

Anyways, unless you're interested in sociology like I am, I bet the episode was pretty dull for most people. Which is really a shame, because most anime aren't near as complex as GitS. I wish the show delved into it's complex side more often, but if it did, the whole show would be philosophical ramblings, and there wouldn't be any room left for character development, a plot, or viewers interested enough to actually sell to.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I barely understood Serial Experiments Lain however I had a vague idea that they were talking about "The Wired" there with their discussion of collective consciousnesses and whatnot. Have you watched SEL?
>> ARTICLE
I haven't. After looking it up though, it seems right up my alley, so I'll probably check it out.
>> ARTICLE
Neat little episode. Tachikoma got a chance to meet its creator, sort of it. It was an interesting interaction between the two to say the least. It's a little cold that the memory of him will be deleted. The AI of the tachikomas I'd really something to think about as far as the development of AI and a possible sense of self awareness. Interesting stuff indeed 
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't expecting what is basically a Tachikoma background episode...
>> ARTICLE
Now why on earth are the refugees resorting to suicide bombing? I can't think of any reason....oh wait maybe it's because they're being treated like shit, live in shanty towns in desperate poverty and have no hope for a future due to decades of incompetent Japanese policy that has utterly failed to integrate them. I'm just amazed that its gone on this far without boiling over into conflict. 

In other news we learn about Goda who at his core feels that Japan has failed to achieve the place in the world that it should have in the wake of the 3rd and 4th world wars. He sees the degradation of information, consumerism driven hyperreality and the decline of the individual in the face of endless waves of information to be the greatest threats and thus aims to create a strong narrative with a strong individualist figure to lead a conflict that will make Japan stir and stir Japan will. Their refugee policy teetered on the edge for years. Goda or not this was inevitable. 

Honestly I found the revelation to be a bit info dumpy but oh well.

The thing with the rows of androids at keyboards always makes me smirk.  Why are they using human interfaces like keyboards?  And in the case of this place the Major infiltrated, they even have specialized fingers that separate into multiple tendrils to do it faster.  Rule Of Cool, I suppose.
>> ARTICLE
My theory was that it allowed the androids to interface with the computer without a need to jack-in and expose themselves to a potential hack.
>> ARTICLE
Hm, plausible enough I suppose.  Though you'd think even giving them a simple keyboard plug would be more efficient than actually typing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, there are definitely more efficient ways to go about preventing a hack. But I guess it comes back to the rule of cool, as you initially suggest.
>> ARTICLE
What exactly was Motoko talking with?
>> ARTICLE
Unless there was an actual explanation, I interpret that as Motoko trawling through Goda's information more than an actual conversation with some entity. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it was a virtual intelligence representing Goda created as a sort of informational interface?

By the way, there is *a lot* of long names and lengthy explanations in this show, so no wonder it's confusing. I gave up on trying to remember all the governmental organizations long ago, I just skim the names and hope they're not crucial :P
>> ARTICLE
A virtual intelligence that Goda fully expected Section 9 to hack into, and thus the potential for information manipulation continues.

The closest thing would be to bookmark [OP's submitted page](https://www.reddit.com/user/UltraKillex/submitted/) and check that daily.

Goda might not be the genius he thinks he is but there is no denying he is pretty clever, cutting of the links between the refugees and Kuze worked brilliantly (but will it continue paying off now that the Major is in the game?) and he definitely has great insight into the human minds


Also is the [old man](http://s10.postimg.org/w90fz6z47/OZC_Ghost_in_the_Shell_S_A_C_2nd_GIG_E23_Mart.png) Aramaki's brother? He reminds me of [Uncle Iroh](https://i.imgur.com/U0Sm9Wx.png), especially with the whole old wise grandpa going on.

he is indeed the brother. we see him in gits 1st series episode 22
>> ARTICLE
I was just thinking that. Aramaki wouldn't have time to go down to dejima, so it's gotta be his brother. 
>> ARTICLE
Aramaki for the save thinking of the UN to buy time. The PM time in office is all but over. She has plenty if enemies, and this is just the reason they need to oust her. Surprised the refugees did the opposite of kuze philosophy 10 seconds after being disconnected from him.

But that quickly? I understand that the uncertainty of one's position in a structure can cause one to error, but I think they should have realized what kuze was saying all of that time to delay any aggression to the military.

I think I gave the refugees too much credit without thinking on how much they relied on kuze. Either way, they moved in the way Goda wanted.

Seems Gouda and Kuze think a lot alike.

The old guy's odd little tea preparation ritual made me curious, and it seems like it's a simplified version of something called a [gong fu tea ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongfu_tea_ceremony), which makes sense for a Chinese refugee.  [Here's a non-simplified version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7zUE6xnnCU)

That's actually Aramaki's brother, who was mentioned but never seen outside of a picture last season. He's not a Chinese refugee himself, but apparently he's traveled the world and spent time with the dispossessed. He probably picked it up that way.
>> ARTICLE
Took me awhile listening to the swordsmen's conversation to figure out if they were for or against the refugees.

Someone needs to invent cyberbrain virtual machines, so they can do virus testing inside one instead of guinea pigging themselves.

At one point Kuze's mouth moved when he talked  is that in indication of agitation on his part?
>> ARTICLE
So are they for or against? Please, do share :P (I think they are against).

I was convinced Borma was hacked the moment he said that 'it was only an essay' and others didn't doubt him even for a while. Turns out it *was* indeed an essay, but still - not a very wise move, was it?

Yep, seems they are against, in the end.

Yeah, everything in my experience was yelling in my ear "that's a dumb plan, guys" when they just said "fuck it, let's touch the trap and see what happens".

I have a question about that line Togusa says. I never actually understood it.

>Refugee Special Action Policy

I assume that this is something that is supposed to benefit refugees. Is it ever explained what this is?

>their chants of, "End the discrimination! Set the refugees free!"

Who's chants? What do the refugees even want? Do they want to be seen as real citizens? Why aren't they returning to their homeland? Or is it that it's the Japanese who want the refugees to be free? As in, they want to be free of the refugees?

Can you help me with this?
>> ARTICLE
This is my 10th or so rewatch of the series, but their is a sort of internal logic to their aims. It's just that Section 9 can't pick up on it because their actual motivations are purposefully kept to themselves. The public and the audience, until this episode at least, has only been privy to the theatricality. A script that seems inconsistent if taken at face value. 
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck? That pretty much sums up this episode for me. As soon as we saw that the professor couldn't find the individual eleven book I was reminded that Goda specialises in information manipulation so it crossed my mind that the essay might not even exist but even then I'm confused. Mostly by the thoughts of the Individual Eleven guys, they kill/terrorise the refugees so that they can make them independant/liberate them, which will in turn make the japanese people see them as invaders? This seems like a needlessly convoluted plan, especially since this probably [isn't even goda's final plan](http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/this-isnt-even-my-final-form-bin-trash-can.jpg)

This seems like a needlessly convoluted plan, especially since this probably isn't even goda's final plan

I think the idea is to spurn the refugees to seek independence and break away from the Japan as their own autonomous state by terrorizing them into a fear/hatred of the Japanese people who refuse to see them as anything but a burdensome other. In this way, the Individualists are pro-refugee in that they hope to ignite a situation whereby the refugees *have* to take action to alleviate their situation. But they're also anti-refugee in that they're steering the country towards a solution that requires expelling the refugees from their society, and the Individualists, Kuze excepted, take pride and enjoyment terrorizing and killing the refugees. To sum up, the Individualists are xenophobic nationalists who are forcing a societal segregation.

It's definitely convoluted, but if successful, it would spur a revolution that would look natural to outside observers. That wouldn't matter to the Individualists agents themselves who believe in the ideals they were infected with, but it provides some protection for Goda because all of this is illegal in the extreme. I mean, it's essentially state sponsored terrorism, definitely a form of treason, and could possibly be construed as a coup depending on perspective and what you believe Goda's endgame to be.

>> ARTICLE
I don't think that realizing the essay was a fake is the key to surviving the virus induced suicide. Like you said, the editor realized it, yet he still offed himself because he was still under the virus' effect. I think Kuze's idealogy, which is different enough from the rest of the Individual Eleven to give him pause, is the key mutant factor that allowed him to break free from whatever programming the virus was supposed to cause.
>> ARTICLE
> Why didn't any of the other Individual Eleven not realize this when Kuze asked for a paper copy of the Individual Eleven? 

When they started checking their pockets it seemed like they were going to realize it but then that driver said they had arrived and it probably went to the back of their mind, I actually thought the driver might be one of Goda's men
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
>No. There are 10 guys in the back, with Kuze and the driver. That makes 12 in all and on the roof, they formed 2 rows of 6 people each.So the driver is also an Individual Eleven member, not one of Goda's men.

I thought that maybe since it is individual eleven there are 11 of them and 1 "undercover" agent, I wouldn't put it past Goda to have one of his men sacrifice himself for the cause, but you are probably right (it just seemed so convenient that just when they would start questioning the essay someone distracts them)



This episode discussion was posted later than usual (5am where I live) so a lot of people probably missed it, last episode had more than twice the amount of comments.
>> ARTICLE
> Why is the discussion so dead on this rewatch? Is the show turning off people? :(

I'd say it's lively for the 40th discussion post. You know, the excitement always dies down with time. The threads are recently posted around 4 a.m. for me, so I only get around to them when I wake up and still not always have time to write a response, and by the moment I have some spare time, the episode is not so fresh in my mind anymore.
>> ARTICLE
OK, sorry for spreading my thoughts into a few comments, but I have one more thing to say. The ending was *brutal.* I literally cringed when the Individual Eleven severed each other's heads, it was totally unexpected - no previous episode had this amount of gore. And the throat-cutting scene. The witnesses' reactions seemed really realistic - the recoil, the screams, the guy running away to call an ambulance with a hand covering his mouth. Only Togusa maintains clear mind, but also - no exaggeration in this scene. Bravo.

What is that horseshoe-shaped thing the Major uses only sometimes to interface with people?

Chief has a thing for the PM.  I *knew* it!

I like how they reduced the resolution and added noise to the flashback scenes.

So Kuze was an idealist and eventually a deserter.  Little bit of charismatic-wanderer thrown in too.  Feels like a lot of things are being teed up in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
The major's thingy is a barrier that can protect her brain from being fried during physical connections.
>> ARTICLE
So when she doesn't use it, it's an emergency or something?
>> ARTICLE
I'm two whole weeks late here but I'm currently reading through these threads as I'm doing my own rewatch and thought I'd pop in. If I understand correctly, all cyberbrains have barriers (I seem to recall the Major mentioning having like three or four herself, but can't remember when) but the neck device acts as a 'dummy' barrier.

This is seen in the episode last season in which the Major connects to the hacked security guard during the whole fiasco with the assassination attempts on the super-intendant general. The guard's attack barriers attack her, but the device takes the attack first and fries, severing the connection before any damage can be done to her cyberbrain. I'd imagine in that case she was taking every precaution given the Laughing Man's reputation as an exceptionally skilled hacker, but ordinarily she is confident that her normal barriers are enough.

As for why its used here with the PM.. not so sure. My guess is that it has other uses besides acting as a dummy barrier. Maybe to keep the connection secure or something. I remember back in one of the first episodes of the first season Aramaki steps outside a security van with, ah, that one.. re-occurring government official whose name I forget (heh, there are a lot of those in this show aren't there?) and uses one of those neck devices to ask him privately about the military's involvement or something similar.
>> ARTICLE
Or a display of the Major's arrogance. She doesn't usually think much of other hackers.
>> ARTICLE
So Kuze likes to make Origami? [Speculation](/s "I'm assuming this means he is the boy that the Major fell in love with? It seems to fit since he also has a full prostethic body and went off to war before he vanished. The Major is a lot smarter than me so I assume she already connected those dots? If there are any dots to connect that is.")
>> ARTICLE
Kuze was a more charismatic leader than I would have thought. I've noticed the relationship between the PM and chief have gone from orders to favors. Things keep getting interesting 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I agree. To be honest in her position, she needs all the friends she can get 
>> ARTICLE
"simple terrorist" kuze is more like a great prophet of terrorism. Dude amassed a fortune from funds that technically don't exist, and yet they do. Kind of a scary real world possible implication. Batou, imo, made a bad call. It's important to stop/capture kuze, but you can't let the nukes get away. Bad move. I don't think the major has recovered from that dive yet. She is still clearly "under the influence", and I'm a little surprised how hard the chief was on her. Section 9 seriously don't expect her to make mistakes. Even if she's fully prosthetic, she's human and capable of mistakes. At the same time, section 9 is not used to losing any of their own so she could just be the target of their frustration.  Usually don't write posts this long, but I had a lot to say lol.

I loved the Puppet Master's comparisons of life and technology. 

In the Section 9 lab, he says "It can be argued that your DNA is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself" in defense of his own sentience. 

Later though, he expresses his insecurities about his inability to reproduce. "A copy is nothing more than a copy...and copies do not give rise to variety and originality". 

HE JUST WANTS TO BE A REAL BOY

Also, wasn't gore exquisite in 90s anime? Watch GitS, [Genocyber](https://youtu.be/pXZ2bTigdGY) (WARNING: GORE), or [Kite](https://youtu.be/mwGHAaQlfgQ?t=42s) (MORE GORE) and you'll see people get giant holes blown in their heads. Gat damn it's gorgeous.

Oh, ok. It's been a while since I've seen the movie, but that scene is stick in my mind as a human. Still really violent though.
>> ARTICLE
I imagine the cables and tubes were purposefully made to look and move like muscle and other innards. The idea of blurred lines between humans and machines is pretty common throughout the film. I think the gore-y imagry was meant to further blur those lines.

Did you see the fluid drip down from the tank after Batou shot it with that BFG? Many filmmakers have used machine fluids to evoke images of blood. I think it's fair to call it gore.

I'm not an expert on future tanks, but I doubt that the pilot's slow, trickling blood somehow made it through the crevices of the thick hull and reached the edge of that arm so fast. He'd have to have some large, gaping wounds spurting towards the cracks in the hull for it to reach the outside as quickly as it did. 

Plus, the liquid is slightly transparent. It looks a lot more like reddish oil or hydraulic fluid than blood.

Hi guys! This is my favourite movie of all time, and I really hope a lot of you first-timers enjoyed it. I figured I'd do a little analysis and answer some questions for those of you who are a little lost, so without further ado:  
  
Q - Am I the only one who doesn't get it? Can someone explain the plot?  

A - No you are not, and yes I can. Public Security Section 9 (Motoko Kusanagi and her team) is given the task of tracking down the Puppet Master (a notorious hacker/cyber criminal), as they believe he/she is responsible for hacking the cyber-brain of the Foreign Minister's interpreter (the unconscious blonde chick with her head open and hooked up to a bunch of wires). They begin by trying to home-in on his position, which leads to the arrest of the garbagemen and the man who gave them the "ghost-hacking" software. What they find is that all three men have had their minds tampered with, either erasing key details (name, birthplace etc), or implanting false memories (the garbageman who believes he is going through a divorce and is trying to Ghost-hack his wife, when in fact he was never married and has no family). All three men had been brain-hacked by the Puppet Master, who was using them to perform the hack on the interpreter. This is essentially a fruitless endeavour.  
They then learn that a facility used for assembling robotic bodies (Shells) had been hacked into suddenly assembling one, which then escapes the facility (the naked blond woman who gets hit by a truck on the highway). After recovering the body, they discover what appears to be a human Ghost inside, despite having no human brain. Nakamura of Section 6 shows up and tries to seize possession of the body under the authority of the Foreign Minister. It seems that they too had been pursuing the Puppet Master and had lured him/her inside this cybernetic body. At this point, the body suddenly awakens and states that it is Project 2501 (the Puppet Master), a self aware computer program, and requests political asylum.   
Now, Section 6 had entered the lab with camouflaged operatives (which is what Togusa had been suspicious of when he's checking the security footage in the car park), who then begin their attack, and escape with the Puppet Master. It's then revealed that the Puppet Master is actually a program which was developed by Section 6 to be used for the dirty work of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. It had gotten out of control and gone rouge, hence why they were so desperate to get it back.  
Motoko pursues the Section 6 operatives and the Puppet Master, which leads her to the the old building where the car is being guarded by the tank. She's ultimately unable to defeat the tank, but Batou shows up just in time to destroy it and save her from being killed.  
He then allows Motoko to dive into the Puppet Master's cyber-brain. The Puppet Master begins to speak through Motoko's body, explaining that he'd learned of Motoko and Section 9 through the net, and had in fact orchestrated their meeting so that he could merge with Motoko, allowing him to experience life, death and meaningful reproduction (reproduction that produces variation, rather than exact copies that all have the same strengths and weaknesses). As this conversation happens and Motoko agrees to the merger, Section 6 snipers line them up in their sights, and open fire. Batou only partially manages to protect them with his own body.  
We then come to the closing scene, where it's revealed that Batou succeeded in saving Motoko (or, the new being that is technically neither Motoko nor the Puppet Master, to be precise), and took her to his safe-house, where he implanted her Ghost into a new cybernetic body (the little girl), as hers had been destroyed by the snipers. She leaves the house and questions what she'll do next, as the Puppet Master's access to a near infinite number of networks has essentially opened up a whole new world to her.  
There are a lot of details that I haven't really touched on, but that's the plot pretty-much summarised.  
 
Q - What's a Ghost? What's a Shell?  

A - A Ghost is basically human consciousness. It's everything that makes you, you, that isn't physical. Your thoughts, memories, personality etc. If you were to completely swap your body for a robotic one, but still be yourself, you Ghost is what they'd put into the new body.  
A Shell is a cybernetic body in which Ghosts are implanted. It should be noted that your brain is still needed. Despite Motoko's body essentially being completely cybernetic, her brain is still her original (with a few cybernetic implants). The process of taking a Ghost from one brain and trying to copy or implant it into a new brain is actually called "Ghost-Dubbing". This process is highly illegal, as the original always dies, and the copy produced is always inferior to the original due to data being lost during the process.  
 
Q - So what is the Puppet Master/Project 2501?  

A - The Puppet Master is an AI developed by Section 6 for the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Its intended use was illegal cyber-espionage and data manipulation which could be used to further the Foreign Ministry's agenda. Because of it's vast and growing complexity, it eventually becomes self-aware and goes rouge. It perceives itself as a life-form, and believes it should be afforded all the same rights as a human being, hence why it requests political asylum. Nakamura of Section 6 disagrees, stating that it's nothing more than a self-preserving program, but the Puppet Master then compares that to human DNA, saying they're basically the same thing:  
"It can also be argued that DNA is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself. Life has become more complex in the overwhelming sea of information. And life, when organised into species, relies upon genes to be its memory system. So, man is an individual only because of his intangible memory... and memory cannot be defined, but it defines mankind. The advent of computers, and the subsequent accumulation of incalculable data has given rise to a new system of memory and thought parallel to your own. Humanity has underestimated the consequences of computerization."  
(For the record I fucking love this quote) 
 
Q - What the hell does the Puppet Master mean when it starts talking about evolution and reproduction?  

A - The idea of evolution in Ghost in the Shell is basically the merging of two sets of DNA in order to create a third with all the key aspects of the two originals, but also with some variations. The Puppet Master's desire ultimately is to reproduce, but it is unable to do so as any copies it makes of itself are literally just copies. Exactly the same. No variation, and thus they could all be wiped out by the same thing. Creating copies of itself does nothing to help actually preserve itself.  
" A copy is just an identical image. There is the possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems and copies do not give rise to variety and originality. Life perpetuates itself through diversity and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system."  
 Because of this, it seeks out Motoko and suggests that they merge. This act of merging is basically described as a new step in evolution, because you're taking an organism that was not born from DNA, and merging it with one that was (something which has never been done before), creating something that has all the key aspects of the originals, but is also different.

>> ARTICLE
The first of many mistakes to be pointed out, I'm sure! =P
>> ARTICLE
Q - Why does Motoko keep getting naked (but hey, I'm not complaining...)?  

A - My understanding is that she's not actually naked. The camouflage technology works better with skin-tight clothing, and while she looks naked, it's actually just a skin-tight body-suit, and her actual skin is a lighter shade than the body-suit itself. But hey, for all intents and purposes, screw it, she's naked. I say this, because there's a much more interesting piece of character development here (no, really).  
You'll notice that any time she appears to be naked, Batou covers her up with his jacket. Motoko has absolutely zero concern or shame when it comes to revealing her body, so she makes no attempt to cover herself at all, which suggests that she doesn't really care for her body at all. This basically subtracts a very human element from her character, which helps blur the lines between man and machine, and plays very nicely with her constant speculation over what it is that makes her who she is.  
Batou on the other hand has retained his sense of modesty, and thus helps cover her with his jacket. This also indicates that he actually cares about her. That it's more than just a work related partnership. You can decide for yourself just how far his feelings for her go based on their interactions,  but it's worth noting that Masamune Shirow himself has stated that Batou does have feelings for her.  
 
Q - Is Motoko Kusanagi a man or a woman?  

A - Chances are this didn't occur to you, and to be fair, it never really did to me either, but I think it's at least interesting. We don't get very much back-story about Motoko (in this film at least), and since she's basically a brain implanted into a cybernetic body, what's to say that it wasn't a man's brain placed into a female body? She certainly doesn't have many feminine mannerisms. She even makes a joke about her period right at the very beginning. Of course her body isn't capable of a period, and it's the kind of off-hand joke that you might expect a man in a woman's body to make.  
Well, to my knowledge, it's never 100% confirmed. Personally, I adhere to the idea that she's a woman. I think most fans do too, and in SAC and the manga, there's more evidence to support this which I won't spoil (it's minor, but hey, spoilers are spoilers). And speaking of the manga...  
  
Q - Does any of this even happen in the manga?  

A - Yes and no. Some scenes are taken from the manga, others are not, and while the whole plot generally is in the manga, there are additional, unrelated story points in the manga which happen before and between the events of this film. Also, I find the atmosphere and tone of this film to be a bit more serious than the manga. Especially Motoko's personality.  
So is it worth reading the manga? in my opinion, absolutely, but don't expect it to strictly be a more detailed version of this film.  
  
Q - What can I expect from Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence?  

A - Oh boy. Let me start this by saying I adore the second film. If you liked the concept of "Ghost Dubbing" which I explained above, then good, because that's a main plot-point. But. If you thought this was hard to follow, the second film takes it to the extreme. It's got very prominent philosophical themes, references to philosophers and their work, and at some points, the characters are talking in nothing but proverbs and quotes, and while it's all relevant to the plot, it can be very inaccessible. It's also very heavy on artistic imagery.  
It's still incredibly good, and I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to watch it, but don't be put-off if you just can't get into it, and definitely don't let it put you off the SAC rewatch. It's okay if you don't get it. I didn't the first time either. It's definitely worth reading an in-depth analysis online once you've seen it.  
That being said, because of it's themes and complexity, I will not be doing a summary like this  for the second film, unless you guys really, really want it. I just don't feel I can explain it all sufficiently. As I say, if there's enough demand then I'll put something together, but at this point, I'm not planning on it.
Anyway, hopefully you've found this helpful! I think I've explained a lot of the key points here pretty well (I may be wrong on some things, please don't hate me if I am!), and if you've got any questions that aren't covered here then by all means, ask away! I know I've just barely touched on the real philosophical, ethical and moral themes of this film, as I mainly wanted to help people get to grips with the actual plot. Looking forward to discussing this further with you all!

EDIT: Well guys, it looks like this actually got a pretty positive response, so I've decided that I will go ahead and put something together for Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence after all. Now that I think about it, a summary there would probably be even more useful than it was here. Plus I thought I was going to be at a music festival this weekend, which is actually next weekend, so yeah, it all works out.
Looking forward to discussing it with you all!

First timer reporting in. I just wanted to thank you for the summary of the plot.
>> ARTICLE
My pleasure. Hope you enjoyed the film!

I enjoyed it, it's cool cyberpunk stuff. I'm doubtfull that I can call it a masterpiece yet however, maybe after i've watched the series as a whole. The movie is atleast an 8.

As /u/AcidOctopus already pointed out, Innocence will be even more philosophical than this Movie :)

Wow, casually i watched it yesterday and was a bit confused but your explanations helped me clearing up the plot, thank you!

Glad I could help. I know a lot of people find the story to be a bit convoluted when they first watch, so I wanted to try and make it a bit more accessible.

I've watched the first and second films, SAC, and read the manga... but your comments still furthered my knowledge and solidified my thoughts. Nice one
>> ARTICLE
No sweat. It really helps to focus your thoughts if you can get it all written down in front of you.
>> ARTICLE
Solid overview.

Kusanagi is indeed 'female' if you watch the ARISE ovas and the new 2015 Movie. I loved the 2015 Movie so if you like this series, definitely watch it.
>> ARTICLE
> I loved the 2015 Movie so if you like this series, definitely watch it.

Isn't it an Arise spinoff or redo?

God, Arise was terrible. No thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Arise is sort of a prequel. The new Arise film is different from the series and its actually pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
It's not a prequel, it contradicts both the movie continuity and the SAC continuity in key ways.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the question of her gender isn't really a common one, but I at least find it interesting. I think I first heard it on some forum where someone was asking because of a comment Batou makes in SAC. Then people started listing things supporting the idea that she could be a man, and if you've read the manga, there's one particular scene which brings into question her sexuality at the very least.

But yeah, you're right. I've always considered her a woman, and any arguments for her being a man are pretty weak in light of the opposing evidence, but I still think it's an entertaining question at least.
>> ARTICLE
If you're talking about the lesbian orgy scene then I think don't read too much into that. The author specifically says the only reason it's all female is that he didn't want to draw naked men.
>> ARTICLE
No kidding? That's the scene I meant, but I had no idea that was the reasoning behind it.
The more you know!

Holy shit, I've been putting off watching all this way too long!

Don't expect it in the show, we talking about the manga here. I think there's a few hints at her sexuality in it but no orgy scenes iirc

How much did it cost you, if you don't mind me asking? I would totally buy a blu-ray, but I've heard they are pretty expensive :/

Honestly, I don't remember how much I paid. It was last year, and mine is the steelbook version. I think... maybe 30? But I honestly don't remember.

If you google around you can probably still find them being sold, and I don't doubt that they'd be cheaper by now. It's the 25th anniversary collectors edition, so you might expect it to have been quite limited, but who knows?

I got mine from Zavvi, and it looks like they're still in stock for 11.99 now. I'm not sure about region locking though. I'm in England, so make sure whatever copy you get works in your region!

Trivia: The first song you hear in the movie, ["Making of Cyborg",](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0z08OpmEPc) is actually [a traditional wedding song](http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/%E5%B7%9D%E4%BA%95%E6%86%B2%E6%AC%A1_%28Kenji_Kawai%29:%E8%AC%A1%E2%85%A0_-Making_Of_Cyborg-).

Easily one of my favourite soundtracks. 
>> ARTICLE
I love that 'interlude' after the garbage men scene. We get to just listen to the music and watch different shots of the city. There's some really gorgeous background art in this film.
>> ARTICLE
I have to say, the lingering shots of the blighted cityscapes with music reminded me a lot of both _Akira_ and _Blade Runner_.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, I especially like the choice of music for that scene. the more traditional music gives it a very surreal mood, and I think it's a pretty radical contrast with the typical electronic-heavy synth most cyberpunk goes for.

also, having checked out more Mamoru Oshii movies after liking GitS1995 so much, I find it interesting how much and how effectively he uses this type of scene. GitS and both Patlabor 1 and 2 all have very similar serene, musical interludes where we take a tour around whatever city we're in. hell, Angel's Egg is basically an entire movie of it. it's amazing every time, too; really lends a sense of mood and place to the scenario.
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell and Patlabor have the best atmospheric music produced thus far. They really set the tone for the movies. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm definitely going to have to check out more of his films if they have this kind of atmosphere! It reminds me of Akira and Evangelion.
>> ARTICLE
yep, they all have different focuses, but the atmosphere building in all of his movies I've seen is top-notch. check out Patlabor 2 next if you liked Ghost in the Shell; more noir than sci-fi, but the atmosphere is similar and great.
>> ARTICLE
The plot of this Ghost in the Shell installment is interesting, but I would say that what really makes the movie is its atmosphere. I can only compare it to Blade Runner (I know, a cliched comparison) with all of its rain shots, moody soundtrack and, of course, the cyborg theme and the questions that follow (Can a machine live? What is life?). My most loved scene (maybe aside from the mesmerizing rain sequence) was the one with the tank shooting up the evolution tree and stopping just before humans. I adore symbolism and I actually prefer things to be stated nonverbally or by proverbs and quotes, so no wonder it was to my liking...

This is my second time watching this movie. For the  first time, I was really confused, because it doesn't waste time introducing the characters, laying out the plot for the viewer to see, or explaining the terms such as 'ghost', 'shell' or 'ghost hacking.' This time, fortunatelly, everything was much clearer, so I was able to enjoy it fully ;) I haven't watched the other parts of the franchise, so I'll definitely stay with you on this rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit, I didn't even notice that tank tidbit after watching a few times. Thanks for the info!
>> ARTICLE
> Blade Runner

The influence is clear, as is that of _Akira_.  Terrific pedigrees to have!
>> ARTICLE
So, unlike some, I didn't really find the movie all that confusing. But it did only scratch at the surface of the story it seemed. It only had enough sustenance to make me want to know more about the universe. The movie itself seemed like nothing more than an introduction, and thus, did not entertain me much.
>> ARTICLE
I really love the movie, but it does feel like both an introduction to the world, as well as looking at some philosophical aspects of part of it.

It's only like 80 minutes, so that's probably why. I really need to pick up the second movie from somewhere!
>> ARTICLE
I did quite enjoy the philosophy of the movie... it was some matrix level thought process. the matrix (philosophically speaking) is a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you, for both movies being an introduction to their respective series, The Matrix feels more complete. However, the follow up movies can't really compare (can't speak for GitS *yet*).
>> ARTICLE
Jesus, this movie is amazing. I'm a first time watcher, thanks for doing this rewatch. Everything- the art, the story, the themes, everything- was 10/10. The art- man, I watch old anime a lot, and it always blows my mind how much prettier hand-drawn animation is compared to modern digital stuff. (Though there's probably a bit of survivor bias going on there.) 

The diving scene was my favorite part. The scene was so simple, yet complex at the same time, and so cerebral and beautifully animated that I felt like I was there. 

If the ScarJo live action one in 2017 is even half as good as this original, then it'll be a pretty good movie. If it can faithfully portray it, even up to 90%, there could be Oscars. 

I think I have a new favorite movie.
>> ARTICLE
I always enjoy ghost in the Shell,  looking forward to innocence since I haven't seen that before

Prepare to be surprised. Innocence is one hell of a ride.
>> ARTICLE
Is it a direct sequel or a stand alone film? 
>> ARTICLE
Technically it is a sequel, but it deals with a completely new case. It's not really a continuation of the Puppet Master case from the first film.
>> ARTICLE
Does it deal with Mikoto and the puppet master merging?
>> ARTICLE
It is more about a buddy-cop misadventure starring Batou and Togusa. Hilarity ensues.
>> ARTICLE
I can't decide if you're evil, a genius, or both.
>> ARTICLE
That's good,  the film pretty much closed that case so there wasn't any need to go back to it 
>> ARTICLE
This was a bit confusing at first, but I ended up enjoying it.  The puppet master had interesting philosophies and quotes, especially the way that he claimed he was human and questioned what being "human" was in this world where man and machine was blended.  The entire movie was hard to piece together but was worth it in the end.  I'm looking forward to seeing what they do in the sequel with the new Major/Puppet Master combo.  


Also - I was surprised to learn that this movie was the inspiration for the Matrix.  Apparently, the Wachowski brothers (the directors and creators of the Matrix) showed their studio this exact film and said "we want to make this a live action movie", but ended up changing it quite a bit into the Matrix that we know today.


I'm also excited to see what a big budget Hollywood production can do for this movie, I think it comes out in 2017?  Should be fun to see what they can do.
>> ARTICLE
The Matrix really did draw heavily from this film. This video makes some pretty good comparisons https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3tF7TL0Qh4

That is fucking fascinating!

I only found out about GitS after a college friend mentioned The Matrix relationship. This was just before the Matrix DVD release and was a big trigger to get me into anime.
>> ARTICLE
No real info to add, just wanted to say phenomenal thread and glad to see the film so highly respected. Also my favorite film of all time.
>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite movies of all time. 

My favorite line is when the Puppet Master comes to life inside the lab and his (its?) first sentence is: "I demand political asylum"

Something just really bad ass about that.

But the philosophical pondering about technology was really ahead of its time, yet still relevant and will only continue to be more relevant.

First saw this movie when I was 7 or so, and it has played a pretty big part in the way I developed. I always thought about technology and artificial intelligence differently after seeing this as a child
>> ARTICLE
sorry guys but to be honest i wasnt much of a fan of it. I mean it was alright but not exactly the best anime iv ever seen. I mean AcidOctopus pretty much covered what was going on from this that i couldnt tell in the movie. I tried to pay attention to it but i just found it hard trying to understand what was going on. I liked the ending though. i found that to be intriguing and making me want to find out what happenes next. Though to me i just didnt find it interesting.  
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely not for everyone, which is part of the reason I did that summary. A lot of people find that the story just doesn't flow well with them, and that it can be tricky to follow. It's good that you at least gave it a shot though.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, it felt pretty quick watching it. as if it was a episode
>> ARTICLE
Its alright- this Movie isnt everyones Cup oTea :)
>> ARTICLE
You should definitely give Stand Alone Complex a chance even if you didn't like this. It's pretty different in tone, more like a crime thriller rather than the more philosphical style of the movies.
>> ARTICLE
yeah ill try to watch everything relating to ghost in the shell in time
>> ARTICLE
Never liked the ending of this movie. Just seemed to rote and routine after that very methodical build-up to that point. I'm a huge fan of tension and release, and that's something GitS does incredibly well. The philosophy is a bit more hit and miss, even though they stage things expertly.

Actually watched this with my Dad and he was astounded by the visuals. It's still one of the most consistent looking animated pieces I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot given that it clearly cheapens out in a few scenes with static images. I never find myself drawn out of it, even in the scenes where it goes all abstract (my Dad got kind of annoyed at the part with the boat).

A classic, though it wasn't as revolutionary for me as some others have taken it. I'm really well versed in science fiction literature though, so it's to reason that I'm not as impressed with the world it attempts to create. From here on out though, it's uncharted territory for me. Excited to see what else GiTS has in store.
>> ARTICLE
Man I'm late to the party on this, is it okay for me to comment?

I love the franchise, and this movie made me discover Kenji Kawai's filmography (Sky Crawlers, Urusei Yatsura). It's a movie that pulls off its atmosphere so well, I sat through this movie the first time not understanding the story. I loved how it didn't explain anything to me directly (well it did have some character exposition) and how you have to dig through it and compare notes with someone (or have /u/AcidOctopus do a writeup).

Gotta go dig through Innocence now.
>> ARTICLE
Haha don't worry, you'll see I did a little digging for Innocence too ;)

It's cool that you decided to comment being this late though. I didn't think people ever really came back to these threads once they've come and gone. It's nice to be wrong some times!
>> ARTICLE
I think people search for discussion threads for the shows they're watching, even if they're not currently airing. The watch group has moved on, but the comments here will be helpful to people for years to come.
>> ARTICLE
I'll definitely add my thoughts on Innocence when I get around to it. The movies are some of Oshii's most renown works, to his dismay and they're among my favorites in cinema.

It's sad he doesn't want to talk about  'em.
>> ARTICLE
Can confirm.
>> ARTICLE
Same.
>> ARTICLE
My first exposure to Ghost in the Shell was watching Stand Alone Complex on Adult Swim/Toonami, and only getting around to the movie just a few months ago. Doing so was a little jarring in a few ways, while for the most part remaining enjoyable and refreshing.

This is the first part of GitS that I've watched in Japanese, due to the dub having a slightly different and weaker cast than SAC. For the rest of the re-watch, I'll alternate between Japanese and English, since watching it subbed will provide a different experience from the English dub that AS/Toonami aired. 

One interesting bit about the Japanese cast is Maaya Sakamoto voicing Motoko in the lolita prosthetic body at the end. For the Arise OVAs, I.G. assembled a whole new seiyuu cast - with her being the one exception. So in a sense, she ultimately grew up with (or into?) the role later on.

If you liked this movie, then I'd recommend the earlier directorial work of Mamoru Oshii - specifically, the Patlabor movies. They're very similar to GitS - same studio, similarly well-detailed animation, soundtracks composed by Kenji Kawai, and the same overall kind of pacing and cinematography.
>> ARTICLE
>Maaya Sakamoto

I had no idea about this piece of trivia. That's actually really cool.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know if there is a place to legally watch SAC? I have the first movie, and am planning on buying the second, but I don't really like buying TV shows, but still like streaming on the PS4.

I know it used to be on Nerflix, but I fucked up and quit watching because it was confusing for me at the time 5 min in :( I don't think it's there anymore...
>> ARTICLE
If you are in the US, Hulu has SAC.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the help :)
>> ARTICLE
This is my second time watching and thanks to that (plus reading /u/AcidOctopus's explanation before watching) I had a much easier time understanding the movie. I'm not sure what to think about the movie, I really like the visuals but there is something that feels off about the story. I'm not sure if it is the way it is presented or the story itself. It might be the lack of information about characters, it's almost as if I'm watching the final episode of a series without watching the other episodes first. I'll still watch the next movie but I think I might like the series more than the movies
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the film does ask quite a lot of the viewer as it doesn't slow things down to explain the world they're living in. The bits that are explained are never really done in a direct way either. Rather than tell the viewer explicitly what a Ghost is, or a Shell is, they instead just use them in context and expect you to come to the conclusion yourself, while simultaneously keeping up with and understanding the story.
It does feel like the film expects you to have some prior knowledge when first going into it, but then I personally find that that allows it to have a very deliberate tone and pacing.
If they were constantly having to slow things down to explain terms and ideas to a newbie cop for the sake of the viewer, then it definitely wouldn't have the same impact, in my opinion at least.
Anyways, stick around for the next movie, and don't feel disheartened if it really doesn't click with you, because SAC is definitely more viewer-friendly and accessible than both of these films.

I definitely will
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really like it.  The philosophical stuff felt kind of forced, I felt no investment in any of the characters, and I'm still incredulous as to the magnum-guy's reasoning for being suspicious in the parking lot; I was completely baffled as to what about the two cars made him decide to check the video surveillance.

I don't see why the tank was completely incapable of landing a single bullet on MC.  You'd think the guy would learn to lead his shots after the first hundred bullets completely missed her.  The only damage the tank caused was from when she was trying to force the stupid thing open, it could've done just as much damage if it was a steel box.

The only part I particularly liked was the ending at Batou's safe house.

Also, what the hell is with all the SMGs?
>> ARTICLE
Shame to hear that you couldn't get into it, but I'll clear-up a few of those questions for you:

Togusa (magnum-guy) was suspicious because as he gets in his car to leave, he notices that Nakamura and Dr Willis arrived in two official vehicles, while neither man is the type to have driven themselves. He expected that they would have had drivers, and so assumed that there must have been more than the two of them.

The tank being unable to hit Motoko really just requires a suspension of your disbelief. You can argue that because she's a cyborg, her body gives her abilities beyond that of a regular human, and thus she was able to effectively evade the tank's gunfire, but, at the end of the day, it's sci-fi action. Not really any different than when you see an actor running from what seems like a hail of bullets and never getting scratched.

The SMGs I'm assuming is because they're more fit for purpose, and just because it's still an action film. I''m no weapons buff or anything, but don't actual riot police use SMGs? It's probably for the same reasoning. A full-sized rifle would be overkill, and a handgun doesn't pack the same punch, both literally and thematically.

But yeah, give the second movie a go next week, but don't let it put you off the SAC rewatch, as a lot of people enjoy the series more than these two films.

I got that when he eventually said it a minute later, but it still seemed silly, and until he said it I was just sitting there confused.

It's strange that you, who didn't really enjoy the bulk of the film, are one of the few people directly stating they enjoy the ending scene.

What did you like about it?


>> ARTICLE
I liked how they slowly led up to "the merge was successful" and how it was unclear if it worked when the snipers fired.  Ending up in a little girl's body from the black market was an amusing turn of events after previously having a super-human cyborg body.  I was also glad that it was just her and Batou at his safe house instead of some sort of big debriefing at Section 9 or a lab.  Batou was probably the character I liked the most, so just having the two of them talking was a nice ending, especially with his neat safe house.
>> ARTICLE
Batou is the lead protagonist of GitS 2: Innocence. He's a lot more relatable than Motoko ever is, and I think the series generally works better as a story wherever he is the focus.

I'm curious to see what you say in next week's thread.
>> ARTICLE
Rewatched it the second time after getting done with SAC. The idea that Animism in data is a possibility in this world is something I cant get my head wrapped around, it's kinda scary not knowing what life is and having to accept established reasons on what a soul and life is. Knowing that we are a small speck of human life in a universe that most likely never ends. 

Also I'm assuming that this( the cover for the bluray) is the offspring that was born in the net when Matoko and the Puppet Master linked their ghost?

A man walks the winter streets. He wears a green jacket and collects guns that he shoots at the range. He quotes Kafka and has a poster of Che on the wall of his apartment that's separated from the world by too many locks. He spends his time railing against the media whose tendrils he sees in every show and every thought. His legs are artificial and he holds contempt for his coworkers but it's really contempt for himself. He dreams of heroic sacrifice, of changing the world, and he makes plans for a murder that he will never carry through. He loves a woman he has never spoken to. He is man caught in a reality he hates but cannot shape and perhaps even if he could he would not for he is hollow man trapped in this own delusion.

I found Night Cruise to be a very affecting episode. Our man is a sad individual, dreadfully scarred, not from the war but from his own indiscretion. He seems largely incapable of self reflection and instead dreams of heroic deeds and deludes himself that he will carry them through. It's rather ironic that the coworker he thinks little of takes action that he only dreams of taking. Section 9's tailing is low key and they conclude as was fairly obvious early on that he though fitting the profile of a potential terrorist to a T is all delusion and no will. He'll shoot the Chairman a thousand times but only in his fantasy.

It's a quiet and contemplative episode and really good one at that and through it we see already how season 2 handles the Stand Alone episodes better. We see the refugee crisis is heating up with terrorist attacks and the demands of the Individual 11 seems to have been broadcast. It builds the world and events that will become very important later.

I think we can all relate to him, though. Stuck in a job he hates working for somebody who barely notices him (if at all). He spends his days fantasizing about the woman he can't have and killing people he thinks deserves it. Shooting them, carving them up, and burying their remains out in the woods where nobody will ever... what were we talking about again?

All jokes aside, this episode creeps me the fuck out. There are people who are actually like this. We see them on the news. People who are usually dealt kind of a shitty hand in terms of social or economic situations and start to become unhinged. This guy's no different. I suppose the key here is whether or not you actually act on negative feelings. Here, we see a guy who certainly seems the type, but merely ends up being a sort of wannabe compared to the seemingly well-adjusted foreigner who winds up being the bomber.

We also see Batou kind of kick the dude while he's down. Between that and the Major posing as some kind of escort to investigate a case, we see a rather dark side that shows what Section 9 is willing to do to get the job done.
>> ARTICLE
I love the little moments of morally questionable actions from Section 9. Such as using the probe virus in episode 8 which was against the telecommunications act, the Major threatening a New World Brigade member with 'dental torture', and them not hesitating when deciding to tap all communications in Japan to find Imakurusu.  
Really reinforces the black ops nature of the group.
>> ARTICLE
I always see a lot of comments in forums how they found this episode to be dull and boring but this was one of the best GitS episodes for sure. We almost never get to see the side of the civilian in this seemingly corrupt cyberpunk world. 
>> ARTICLE
I love that the show does things like this  gambling on a very different kind of episode, with hardly any link to the main story or the main characters, so we can get a more fully fleshed-out feel for the world in which it takes place.
>> ARTICLE
Well, that was a rather queer episode compared to everything I've seen in GitS so far. Loonatic narration, barely any presence of Section 9 members, and made-up conspiracies. I've heard a story that this episode was even withhold from airing (don't take my word for it) because it ultimately disappointed the directors. It certainly feels ~~discontinued~~ (edit: I think I meant misplaced, different from the rest of the show).

The most entertaining part for me was drawing parallels with Taxi Driver. The mirror scene was the most obvious one, I think; long night cruises in the rain, neon lights outside the windows, a feeling for an unattainable woman, and sleepy monologues were the others. Not to mention the crazy character who wants to execute his justice on who he thinks represents the corruption of this world.
>> ARTICLE
I hope they didn't really want to prevent this from airing. It maybe isn't a great episode if a viewer was tuning in to see Section 9 bust up some bads, but without it the show loses a really important perspective I don't think we ever see again.

This is the only time we see the society depicted in SAC from the absolutely bottom of the social ladder. Section 9 and the government ministers all stand near the top, looking down on the decisions made by the people they protect and represent. They're shepherds, living distinctly separate lives to their flock. By only seeing the world from their hillock we don't gain enough insight to really empathise with the rest of society. The world they see is a different reality, and we should be given a chance to recognise it is only different and not more accurate.

The guy in this episode is certainly a weirdo, but his view isn't any less important.

Episode 9, CHAT! CHAT! CHAT!, from last season is another example where we're shown how thoroughly differently our heroes views are to the common man. Well, maybe not quite. The people in the chatroom all being massive Laughing Man fanboys problems puts them in their own warped worldview. Still important though.

Actually, writing this comment, I've realised we only ever get to see fringe perspectives in SAC. Togusa and his family are the closest to normal, and as time goes on his outlook only becomes more cynical. Maybe this is a deliberate theme, where we're barred from experiencing a normalised outlook on the world. Section 9 certainly is.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I loved Chat! Chat! Chat!

This episode was probably so difficult for me to watch because of the ever-changing perspective, I couldn't figure out what Gino's real job was, who was his employer, who was the guy he wanted to assassinate, etc.

But I liked the bit about cyborgs not having some vital parts (like a penis or even internal organs) with all of its consequences. I think most of the show and the movies don't emphasize this enough. I thought cyborgs were still constructed to imitate people even inside, with all the functional organs. It seems it's either not so easy or at least not everyone can afford it.

I wonder if Major could make normal sex with her body fully cyborgized. Obviously getting pregnant seems out of question, but maybe she has some accommodations down there.
>> ARTICLE
There are sexbots, so it's an option for people. *However*, that likely requires expensive parts as that's the one area where it needs to feel like the real deal.

You can likely create an artificial womb inside of a woman, but an uterus has to have so many things working in conjunction with the rest of the human body that the price must be astronomical compared to a simple body prosthetic.

The man in this episode seems to be a guy who got the regular military treatment, which means "just barely functioning". He didn't warrant a higher-end model as a grunt and he obviously can't afford it on his own, so there he is... built like a Ken doll.

Poker Face is one of my favorite anime episodes of all time and solidified Motoko as one of my favorite anime characters.

Unexpected backstory time :o Seriously, what an episode. Saito really has a dark past as a sniper. I'm sure the movie referenced is Fullmetal Jacket, the whole sniping scene was almost a copy.

Section 9 members fighting with one another. Saito as a mercenary against UN forces. Dilemma - save the injured comrade, or stay clear of enemy fire? And the final showdown. Brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, the simulation scene. What the hell can you do against a cyborg programmed to shoot down bullets mid-flight? Good thinking on Saito's part in the end, but I always imagined that a cyborg fighting organics to be like this: not overpowering them with brute strength, but simply having such an overwhelming advantage that fighting a cyborg head-on would be inconceivable.

Jeez Motoko, way to give the kid a nosebleed and other things lol . But jokes aside, we get to see how powerful the influence kuze has. They've been wondering how he can manage to influence so many, and the kid just says he talked to people. Man what a sense of humor, nobody in section 9 knows how to take a decent vacation. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the one with the kid.  I still don't quite follow what went on between him and the Major.  What was she trying to prove with the seduction act?  Why did she let him rifle through her stuff?  Why did the kid plant that locker key on her?

Other than that, it's neat seeing her out in the foreign lands by herself, no super duper support team or system in place.  Aside from that, I have to wonder why full-body prosthetic users need to bathe more than once in a blue moon.

Even in the future the tax man always gets his due. 

This is such a fun episode with Section 9 doing an Oceans 11 on behalf of the tax bureau. Its got Section 9 dolled up for a depraved sex party, its got lecherous political and economic elites with their sex bots, its got twists and turn and the Major in a hella sexy cat burglar suit. With all that what's not to like?

There isn't that much high level stuff going on, it's very self contained and only really connects to the rest of the series through the mention of former Assembly Chair Yakushima's money. However it's probably the most fun episode there is and easily one of my favorite Stand Alone ones. 

I especially loved the ending. Batou and the Major enjoying some quiet relaxation at the beach sipping on martinis and and pina coladas only to have Aramaki turn off the projection and complain about paperwork.

Not enough Major in a sexy dress and stockings.

They went all James Bond on this one, right down to the tuxes.  Kinda funny how Tadokoro was so into the Major it didn't even occur to him there's no reason she'd be into him  didn't suspect a thing.

This also touches the inevitable topic that has to come up sooner or later when you start talking about realistic android/cyborg technology:  sex bots.  Here it's apparently still a rich man's pastime.  But it makes me wonder if maybe there aren't android-based cathouses somewhere in this landscape, for the poorer set.
>> ARTICLE
>Kinda funny how Tadokoro was so into the Major it didn't even occur to him there's no reason she'd be into him  didn't suspect a thing.

I figured with rich, old people like this, they basically acknowledge that the only reason for a woman to bother with them is for their money/status/connections. They expect to be the target of goldiggers and they pay in their own way. There's no way they would think that they "still got it".

If there's one thing you can be sure to find in nearly every episodes it is the Tachikomas being cute, the Major being sexy and Batou being worried about the Major.


If all the standalone episodes are good like this then I am going to love this season!

>> ARTICLE
I am kind of flabbergasted by the "victim" in this episode. He can't remember the guy's fucking name, but manages to pull his calling card that spells out his name? HURR DURR.

We finally get to see the Major in something classy and *god damn*. When she turns on the charm, I doubt any of you are saying no. Seeing her in the sarong at the end was nice, too.

You gotta love how Batou and Togusa don't bother with the bowties, while Pazu and Borma go all fancy-like. Kind of shows that they can't be bothered when they're getting down to the nitty-gritty.

Unfortunately, this is pretty clearly a budget episode. The faces are off, the angles are weak to keep movement down, and what animation there is looks a little choppy.

Despite all that, this is a ton of fun to watch. It's a shame it couldn't have been a two-parter, because building everything up a bit more would have been better.

Yeah, a lot of the stand alone episodes should have been two parters, since it would allow for greater plot depth and characterization for minor characters.

Well, one of my favorite cartoons of all time is DCAU Justice League. Every story written for that show up until Justice League Unlimited was written as a two- or three-parter. I might not remember the intimate details of every arc, but I remember every story that show told.

I don't think anyone's talked about the opening credits of 2nd gig yet. 

["Rise"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIqgxeNtl0) is the original opening to 2nd Gig. It's a solid song, though both the song and opening are more on the nose than "Inner Universe" from the first season.

2nd Gig also has an alternate opening that was shown during rebroadcast, which I happen to like a bit better. The song ["Christmas in the Silent Forest"](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2lcfdw) trades the overt mention of soldiers and fighting of "Rise" for vague imagery and a more atmospheric melancholy, matching the music with some really great time-lapsed animation of Section 9 going about their business.


>> ARTICLE
An episode full of menace. The music, the decrepit ruins of Tokyo, the confusion and rising tension all made for a very grim and intense affair. 

Section 9 got played, hard. They are clearly unhappy with the whole government lapdog thing that's going on and being ordered around by Goda clearly stings but to be used as simple decoys must be galling for them. Whatever else one wants to say of Goda the man sure has presence. He steals every scene he's in with a combination of smug superiority and chilling confidence.

Something doesn't quite add up about the plutonium. As Togusa said it was a straight up excavation going on at the old nuclear plant and not a sealing operation. The PM didn't even know about the operation until long after it had begun suggesting nefarious intent.

We again get to see the miserable condition of the refugees. Tokyo is a total wreck. Abandoned for 30 years and housing tens maybe even hundreds of thousands of poverty stricken people who have no hope for a better future. Successive Japanese governments have failed to address the issue and left the refugees marginalized and now that lack of action is coming home to roost. They have only themselves to blame.  
>> ARTICLE
> The PM didn't even know about the operation until long after it had begun suggesting nefarious intent.

I got the impression it was only after her recently becoming PM that she was allowed to know.
>> ARTICLE
Current theory is that Goda wants/is working for someone who wants the refugees to riot. The way he intentionally made the soldier on edge and then made him part of the group that met the garbage men. And his group definitely had something to do with the helicopter thing that went crazy and was just circling over the refugee area. If that thing had crashed it would have been a huge problem. 

One thing I like is that he constantly says one of his jobs is data manipulation and we see he's really good at it even on a personal level, making the soldier paranoid and thinking the pipe was a gun.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the two suits he had with him were the same that went to the pilots apartment and seemed the drop the card. The way I understood it was that simply the presence of the helicopters hovering over their heads for hours was already pissing the refugees of since they didn't know it was a malfunction. Goda never intended the heli to crash, or he wouldn't have explained how to disable the AI
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely understand batou's frustration, and he probably isn't the only one frustrated. The major is right though.  They are playjng defense compared to being aggressive as we've seen on the past not to mention having outside sources interfering. Goda just continues to make a case for most unliked character this season. 
>> ARTICLE
Curious how Gouda set them up as decoys, yet still went with them.  Perhaps to ensure there would be an incident?
>> ARTICLE
To be honest Section 9's angst over being chained by the government isn't something I can get behind. They should be strictly supervised given their role in society. We cant be having paramilitary organizations running free around and above the law. It isn't socially healthy. 

Anyway Section 9 continue to be played and hard at that. They go after a man seen at the shooting of a news office building. However Section 1 are fed bad intel and end up killing the man thinking he is a Taiwanese terrorist before Section 9 can make the arrest. Goda and the CIS are clearly playing a huge game here and it's oh so interesting to watch. 

We learn a bit about Goda here. That he wrote a fascinating thesis on the subject of cyberization and individuality concluding that cyberization eats away at ones individuality and causes the rising of strong individuals to lead the way for the collective. It's almost as if he had studied the Laughing Man case before it even happened. He also worked for a large private corporation and worked in intelligence before the CIS was formed but never rose to a high position. His psychological profile was fairly mundane. He's clearly brilliant and strongly motivated but by what we cannot yet know. 

Like the last episode there's a magnificent rising tension throughout. The live TV debate which discussed the refugee crisis and revealed the Individual 11 to the public got more and more forceful and the music continued it's creeping rise as the full extent of the double play came into focus. 2nd Gig is so far fantastically paced and links its Stand Alone episodes to the main story threads so much better than the first season. 
>> ARTICLE
They don't want to be chained by the government that's obviously being almost directly controlled by the Army/CIS. Section 9 is annoyed at being tethered to the Prime Minister because she's sort of a unwilling pawn of the Defense Ministry and every thing involving the Prime Minister directly is some kind of power play. Their job has never been to engage in internal politics, but they're being forced to because that gives the CIS free reign to start a war/commit treason/stack the government in favor of the Defense ministry.

Being *constantly* directly supervised and ordered around by someone like the prime minister makes it hard to do anything secretly. Section 9 isn't meant to be transparent, and if there is an argument to be made that in an ideal government Section 9 shouldn't exist, I wouldn't say making that point when the CIS is clearly bordering or outright committing widespread treason.
>> ARTICLE
> To be honest Section 9's angst over being chained by the government isn't something I can get behind. They should be strictly supervised given their role in society. We cant be having paramilitary organizations running free around and above the law. It isn't socially healthy. 

It's true, but people have a tendency to see themselves as knowing what's best and fighting for what's right, with any restrictions merely acting as interference against that perceived virtuousness.  It's easy to take oversight as a bad thing, regardless of its necessity.  Section 9 is not immune to this kind of thinking, clearly.
>> ARTICLE
>To be honest Section 9's angst over being chained by the government isn't something I can get behind. They should be strictly supervised given their role in society. We cant be having paramilitary organizations running free around and above the law. It isn't socially healthy.

I have to agree with you on this. However, I think an important thing to note is that, while you would expect that to be the way an agency like Section 9 operates, most members have a gritty past, and the agency itself doesn't officially exist. That, coupled with the whole "dystopian cyberpunk" setting make it easy to presume that this is a norm in society in this timeline. And while most modern governmental agencies are heavily restricted by the government, it's not hard to imagine that if there was a version of Section 9 that existed today, it would likely get away with anything, and everything. 

I agree with you about the agency's role in society, but considering the story is viewed from Section 9's perspective, I doubt that either Section 9, or the writers themselves, realize the flaws in the characters' mentality.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you're right. Section 9 is par the course for the world of Ghost in the Shell and there's plenty of other organizations like it and even the official ones regularly engage in illegal activities. It's all part of the dystopian future that it presents. 

I get that Section 9 aren't really going to be considering their role in a democratic society but I'd like to see a bit of in world discussion. I mean in the first season when Section 9 are outed it's mentioned that the public get pretty pissed so there's some recognition of their dubious role. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit confused by all that is going on this episode, especially the guy on tv, if I'm getting it right he was used by someone in the CIS (but not Goda) to inform people of the existence of the Individual Eleven group (which may or may not exist) but I don't get why? What is the CIS after? 


There's also Kawashima and Section 1 who believe him to be Wong Chu Ren (again because of the CIS).


Then there is all that talk about carriers and infection agents which seem to be connected to Goda's thesis about someone consciously controlling the subconscious of others.


There's layers and layers of thing I'm confused about in this episode, I hope the next episodes will explain more because the thing that would shed light on most of my questions would be why the CIS does what it does.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
I see, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the explanation. Goda is really interesting. About Kawashimas dialogue near the trashcan, I actually thought he was being sarcastic since it showed all that food being thrown away and then saying that the country isn't rich enough for the refugees.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty confusing episode, mostly I think because we're seeing it through the confused eyes of our protagonists.

Batou notes in passing that the refugees have been there for *over twenty years*.  Shit, Japan, after five you're pretty much done, just let 'em in and be finished with it.
>> ARTICLE
can someone explain what happened in the end? Were those refugees the same ones who talked with Kuze earlier in the episode?
>> ARTICLE
Yes they were, the Major found a cyberbrain filter on one of the boats which means he was using that to communicate with the refugees while not actually there. 
>> ARTICLE
Kind of a bad time to show that the major isn't perfect huh. Going too deep in kuze's cyber brain really did some damage,physically or psychologically?  Either way it seems to have a lingering effect. On the other hand,  kuze is making power moves. 
>> ARTICLE
Kuze is still kuze even without the plutonium. It still works in their favor as he stated that they weren't meant to be actually used. They were just a deterrent. Then again those deterrents didn't prevent ww3 or ww4. (I think they mentioned there was a ww4). Section 9 had taken several losses, and I'm curious to see Goda make his grand reintroduction for the finale. Just on a side note, I think one of the reasons the major was off balance was because he was the boy she knew from her childhood. 
>> ARTICLE
And he knows it, that's why he told her that diving his ghost will only cause her pain.
>> ARTICLE
So the thread is up! (You might want to fix the schedule in the table).

Section 9 might be on an unlucky stretch, but their core members are still immortal. Ishikawa and Batou will survive anything. We've got the whole scene set up and arranged for the final confrontation - Kuze will probably enter Dejima shortly with his fake stockpile of plutonium. For the public opinion though, an empty threat is as good as any, so this definitely isn't going to stop him from carrying out his plan.

It's rather obvious now that Kuze is the boy from Major's memories. It should play some role in the final confrontation. You can predict some of the final events from the titles of upcoming episodes... The resolution seems obvious to me, but I'll still watch the endgame with interest. Let's see what Goda has up his sleeve.

Good catch.

The Tachikoma [are so smooth](http://webm.host/8c1d5/vid.webm)

In ep 20 Section 9 fired first on military mechs didn't they? Does that mean they are effectively declaring war on Goda / inviting themselves to be labelled as rouge terrorists again. Also at the end of this episode I don't see how Kuze is going to get away, yes the blackout + live footage talking about plutonium is an epic combo, but in the end the navy is still all over him... abit of a plothole for sake of epicness I guess.

It kinda sucks that first time watchers have to wait a day because you didn't post, this is too good to stop!
>> ARTICLE
Sorry about yesterday's thread. I've taken steps to make sure the remaining episode discussions run like clockwork.
>> ARTICLE
Watching half the squad struggle to shake off the rangers from Section 4 proves the truth to Gouda and the Major's assertions that Section 9's greatest weakness is numbers.

I don't think anyone's mentioned Proto's subtle introduction as an important new member of Section 9. As a biodroid, he's really bluring the line the between man and machine. Just as Togusa doesn't realize Proto isn't a person until he's hit by an attack barrier, the audience is left in the dark because his interactions in all the previous episodes betray nothing about the artificiality of his intelligence unless you're looking for it, i.e. last episodes conversation with the Tachikomas. In fact, I'm not sure *person* is the right word because as an independent, intelligence in a partially organic, partially prosthetic body, he is not much different than the rest of humanity.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I always thought he was an android so I was not that surprised, the way he behaved was too much like those woman androids that section 9 has
>> ARTICLE
I think Proto's supposed to be a nice little nod to Shirow Masamune's other famous work [Appleseed](http://myanimelist.net/manga/668/Appleseed).
>> ARTICLE
The episode's obvious MVP is the tragic hero Kuze who drops truth bombs all over the place...

> But what disillusioned me most was the people took no responsibility... for anything.

> When the masses come across information they agree with, they immediately internalize it.

> ... when [people] come across information that suits them, they get swept along the pass of least resistance, just like everyone else. I suppose that in the end, humans are designed to follow the path that was easiest for them. 

Eventually, he reveals the base motivations of his ideology and it is tragic and heartbreaking:

> When people feel no sense of responsibility, no matter what they unintended consequences of their actions, that make very poor use of the net. My revolution is also an act of revenge on such people. 

Oddly enough, Kuze is a savior figure for both the refugees and the Japanese people. He attempted in life to give both what they secretly desired, independence and self-determination for the former and the release of the burdensome refugees for the latter. 

> I will grasp the memories and Ghosts of those who are linked to me. And take them into the net. If a nuke is dropped here, they will lose their physical bodies but they will gain the chance to undergo a forced evolution. 

Yet in being denied this ambition, he falls back on the true revolution he desired as someone disillusioned with inability of the refugees to demand and effect change and the callousness with which Japan treats them. And so he condemns the refugees who were unable to foster a revolution without him to the net. And through this, he will subvert the net superstructure that the Japanese people rely on by infusing it with a new base consciousness formed from the ignored and oppressed.

>  I wanted to abandon this cripple body and paddle out onto the sea of the net if such a thing could be done. 

But this is not an act done purely out of malice. He views it as salvation. An evolution towards a purer existence in a world where the disconnect between man and machine has diluted the meaning of human existence.

In a way, he is right. This revolution, if successful, could be the right step towards equalization in a world that's been divided by rapid technology growth and four world wars. The tragedy of Kuze is that he continues to come up with viable solutions to the injustices of the world, only to be stymied every step of the way.
>> ARTICLE
One thing I don't get about that is that the Major said that most refugees didn't have cyber brains though right? Or was that only about the places she visited to find out more about Kuze?
>> ARTICLE
That's a possibility she mentions next episode. 

> Motoko: Even if you and I successfully upload our Ghosts into cyberspace and we manage to survive, what about people who don't have cyberbrains? 

> Kuze: Refugees with family members like that will have difficulty accepting this decision, I know. I expect they'll lose faith in me and leave Dejima of their own accord. 


... but she doesn't say here that most refugees will be unable to undergo the revolution. In fact, I'm not sure we have much indication about the cyberization percentage among refugees aside from Motoko mentioning in "Another Chance" that there are at least three million refugee cyberbrains hubbed to Kuze.

It's pretty reminiscent of the plot of the first movie, now that I think about it.  Except in this case it's in reverse  tangible beings becoming intangible, and living in an intangible place.

Oh so this is why Batou has special eyes, I knew he used to be in the rangers but didn't know this was why he kept his easily hackable (by the Major at least) eyes.


Did Goda not think of the possibility that the rangers might hold off on killing Section 9 when seeing Batou? Or does he not care because he still has the nuke as an option so section 9 is irrelevant

Both. He likely trusted in the rangers' reputation and dismissed any risk because of his nuclear fallback.

Hi again! Hope you all enjoyed Innocence! I personally prefer the first film, but still find Innocence to be a cerebral blast. Let's get right into it, shall we?

Q - What. The. Fuck?

A - I know right?

Q - No seriously, dude. What the fuck?  

A - We open with our old friend Batou driving his car through a busy street towards a crime scene. Upon arrival, the officers on-scene explain to him that they've been in pursuit of a malfunctioning Gynoid (robot). They've cornered it in an alley, but it's killed two officers and it's owner already. Batou heads inside, discovers the bodies of the officers, and the Gynoid itself. It begins attacking him, but Batou is easily able to defend himself. Defeated, the Gynoid begins to repeat "Help me". It then attempts suicide,but Batou kills it first with his shotgun.
  
Back at headquarters, Batou and Togusa are told that this is one of eight cases in which this particular model of Gynoid (named Hadaly), produced by Locus Solus, had malfunctioned and killed someone. What makes it particularly strange is that there had been no civil lawsuits filed by the families of the victims, and that two of the victims include a politician and a public servant, which suggests that this could be an act of terrorism.  

They're then given instructions to investigate further, and try to determine whether or not this is a case Section 9 should really be spending their time on. At the forensics lab, Batou and Togusa meet Haraway, a forensics scientist who explains that the Gyroid had somehow disobeyed "Moral code 3" which is basically "Do not harm humans". Furthermore, they learn why none of the families of the victims had tried suing Locus Solus; the Hadaly model of Gynoid has been fitted with "extra organs". They're sexbots. Hence why the families wouldn't want the public knowing, and chose not to sue. The last little detail we get is that all the Hadaly's who killed themselves had their brains wiped, except for the audio file repeating "Help me".  

They decide their next move should be to talk to the man in charge of inspecting the Hadalys, and just at that moment, they get a message telling them that the very same man has just been discovered dead at a boathouse. When they arrive, Ishikawa is already there and explains that the man had been missing for 5 days. Batou finds a 3D picture of a young girl, and they decide to leave as the forensics team shows up.  

The forensics report reveals that the inspector had been killed by a blow to the neck, and was then chopped up with all those bloody knives you saw in the boathouse. The mangled doorknob was done with an illegal military-grade cyber-arm. They also learn that a car spotted on the scene is registered to a group of Yakuza (Kojinkai), and interestingly enough, a Gynoid had killed the boss of the Kojinkai just three days ago. This being their next lead, Batou and Togusa head out to pay the Kojinkai a visit.  

Now, the Kojinkai obviously have a new leader, so Batou and Togusa demand to see him. Things quickly go bad, and Batou shoots the place up, killing the cyborg responsible for the inspector's death in the process. They interrogate the Yakuza boss, who admits to organising the murder of the inspector, and that Locus Solus had actually told them where he was. He doesn't know any more details regarding the former boss' involvement with Locus Solus.  

After a short bollocking from Aramaki, Batou heads home, and stops-off at a convenience store. While there, he believes he is under fire from enemy gunmen. He starts shooting back, and is hit several times in his arm. As his vision begins to fail him, Ishikawa suddenly appears behind him, holding a device to the data ports on the back of his neck. We then cut to Batou in a lab, having a new cyber-arm fitted to replace his arm that had been shot. It's revealed that he'd been brain-hacked. There were no gunmen, and his arm was actually shot by himself. With the situation clearly becoming more dangerous, Batou and Togusa decide to head to the Northern Frontier to gather more information on Locus Solus.  

Once there, they decide to visit a man named Kim; an ex-military electronics expert. Upon entering his mansion, they discover what appears to be a dead cyborg. Batou knows this is Kim just playing dead and demands that he talks. Kim then begins talking about the differences between dolls and humans. At that point we suddenly loop back to Batou and Togusa entering the mansion. This time, the mansion has changed slightly. Batou notices the differences, and once again demands answers from Kim (whose body is now a cyborg replica of Togusa). Kim keeps talking about man and machine, and then we loop again. Batou and Togusa enter the mansion for a third time, more details have changed, and Kim's body is now a replica of Batou. Suddenly, a battleship begins firing upon the mansion, and then, we're brought back to reality by Batou holding a device to the back of Togusa's neck; it seems that he had been brain-hacked this whole time.  

With Kim basically being a dead-end, it's now time to take-on Solus Locus directly. The company's factory is the battleship itself. Togusa uses what's left of Kim's brain as a proxy to hack the company's security, and Batou enters. The ship still realises that there is an intruder, and sends guards after Batou, but the Gynoids suddenly activate and begin attacking the guards. Some of the Gynoids also manage to surround Batou, putting him in a very dangerous position. Strangely enough, one of the Gynoids comes to his aid, helping him fight back the others. With the immediate threat disposed of, we learn the Gynoid is none other than Motoko Kusanagi, who is controlling it remotely.  

Batou then defends Motoko as she's hacking into the ship, disabling all the security systems and attacking Gyroids. She's successful, so the two are then free to explore the ship and find out just what the hell has been going on, but not before Motoko sets the ship on course for Japanese waters, so that it can be used as evidence.  

The two eventually come to a room filled with large pods, and it's revealed that Locus Solus had been using young girls supplied by the Kojinkai to ghost-dub their ghosts into the Gynoids, giving them a more "human" personality, and ultimately trying to make them a better product. Batou opens up a pod and discovers the young girl from the 3D photo he found at the boathouse, and we learn that the inspector had made it possible for the Gynoids to break "Moral code 3", so that someone would notice and start investigating once they started causing trouble.  

Kusanagi disappears back into the net, and we close with Batou dropping-off Togusa back at his home
.  
Again, this summary skims over a lot of important details, but that's the basic plot, as I understand it.  

Q - So one more time, what's Locus Solus, what's the Northern Frontier, and what was their whole evil plan?  

A - Locus Solus is the company that produced the Hadaly model of Gynoid. They put their facility on the battleship out in the Northern Frontier because they would be free from national laws and investigations. The Northern Frontier itself is the remains of a massive economic hub, which has become a lawless haven for unsavoury characters. Locus Solus was taking kidnapped girls supplied by the Kojinkai, and using them for ghost-dubbing so their Gynoids would have more realistic personalities, and in case you missed it: Ghost dubbing is the act of copying a person's ghost into another cyberbrain. It's illegal because the person always dies, and the copy is always inferior to the original because data is lost in the ghost dubbing process.  

Q - Can you explain the conversation with Haraway in the forensics lab?  

A - Okay, so, the main message that this film tries to get across is that humans, machines and animals are all of equal value. That's why there's so many conversations comparing people to dolls, and questioning what defines humanity in comparison to machines and animals. Their conversation therefore begins by speculating how a robot could commit suicide. Haraway suggests that it's because humans treat them poorly, and simply discard them once they've outlived their usefulness, or once a new model is available. Those machines begin to deteriorate, just like a human would if it was cast out onto the street, and concludes that that is the reason for their suicide.  
She goes on to suggest that if we define "humans" as beings with a strong sense of identity that act completely of their own free-will, then children cannot be classed as humans, as they're still learning their sense of identity. Still forced to act under the authority imposed by their parents. By that logic, children are almost like artificial intelligence. Children are like dolls; created in man's image, but not quite qualifying as human yet.  
I just found this online as well:
"One of the minor characters, forensic analyst Ms. Haraway, is a reference to the real-world professor of sociology and biology, Donna Haraway, who is a stern contributor to the whole transhumanism, post-cyberpunk movement. She has been quoted as saying that "I'd rather be a Cyborg, than a Goddess", in reference to her firm belief that in order for women to really liberate themselves from a "patriarchal society", they should devote themselves to technology and its applications and become cyborgs, as a means of separating themselves from men, and the common misconception of "what defines a woman and a female", including the stereotype that what defines a female as a woman is her decision to bear children. Ms. Haraway in the films has no children of her own, and does not facilitate or even comprehend the emotional content that comes with bearing a child; she thus has a rather harsh feminist outlook on child-rearing and childbirth."

Q - Then what was up with Kim and that whole mansion trip?

A - Kim used to be a long-range scout for the military, but his behaviour hindered his career. He bounced around between different units, before ultimately becoming weapons dealer on the black market, and a commonplace hacker. Batou and Togusa visit him in the hopes that he'll have some info on Locus Solus which can help further their investigation.

Upon entering the mansion, Batou and Togusa are brain-hacked and forced into a repeating cycle. That's why you see the scene of them entering the mansion looped several times. The differences in the cards on the floor near the doll in the foyer are a message from Motoko, intended to help Batou realise that they're stuck in a loop. They ultimately succeed, and Batou realises that Motoko, his "Guardian Angel", was the one to help them, because the cards read "2501" in the final loop. "2501" is the project number for the Puppetmater; the being Motoko merged with in the first film, at the end of which they agreed to use "2501" as their secret password for when they met again.

The conversations Batou has with Kim are once more about comparing humans and dolls. Kim has tried to basically turn himself into a complete cyborg, hence why his body is so obviously mechanical. Kim believes that dolls are superior to humans, stating that a truly beautiful doll is a living, breathing body devoid of a soul (by which he means ghost). He says that human awareness is the reason for our imperfection, because it only allows us to perceive part of reality, and gives us desires that can't be fulfilled. Dreams that will never be realised. Perfection, to him, can only be achieved by those who have no consciousness (dolls), or infinite consciousness (gods).
He then suggests that animals are also on equal footing with dolls and gods, because while they are conscious, they're still not self aware, and so they can experience simply being alive, with no wants or desires. He basically describes it as a pure form of joy.

The next part of their conversation happens during the second loop of the mansion. Kim is now explaining why we find dolls to be unnerving. It's because dolls are created in man's image that we find them creepy. They force us to face the reality that we're all essentially a mass of various mechanisms working in unison, much like a machine. They make us face our mortality. He then explains that because we ultimately perceive ourselves this way (a bunch of parts which are ultimately destined to fail), we've used science to try and overcome death. Where we first set out to achieve a perfect form, the advent of externalised memory has caused us to pursue a way to cheat death itself (if you could store your consciousness in a machine, you won't ever need a perfect body because theoretically, you'll never die).

In the third loop, Batou has figured everything out, and as the mansion is being attacked by Locus Solus's ship, he snaps Togusa out of it too. They then confront Kim, who is shocked that they were able to beat his brain-hacking game. We don't really get any more info out of Kim at this point, and Batou and Togusa decide to head straight to Locus Solus' ship.

Q- Okay, so, that parade scene?

A - Honestly, there's no real explanation further than what you can deduce yourself. The film is all about dolls, machines, humans, animals, philosophy, science etc. To have such a picturesque parade celebrating Japanese mythology in the heart of a technological dystopia is a beautiful breed of irony, in my eyes. There's people, machines, dolls, masks. It's a fantastic juxtaposition. And those three minutes of animation supposedly took over a year to make. Even if you can't gather any real meaning from it, it's fucking beautiful.

Q - What's the significance of Batou's dog?

A- That dog is actually in a lot of Oshii's films, partly because he loves them (he has one himself). You'll remember seeing it in the boat scene of the first film, where Motoko spots it on the bridge. As far as I'm aware, the dog is supposed to be the only "natural" thing in the whole film. It's just a dog. It's not been augmented and had a cyber-tail attached. It's a dog. It serves to juxtapose something real, with all the artificial elements of the world of Ghost in the Shell. The scene where Batou gets home and feeds his dog, and it sits on his lap? It's just an intimate look into Batou's life, and a nice little display of very natural interactions. This is no longer a super-powered cyborg investigating a sexbot murder scandal. It's a man taking care of his dog. I personally find it to be quite charming, and a little sorrowful.

Q - There were a few key quotes in this film. Can you explain what they mean?

A - "Let one walk alone, committing no sin, with few wishes, like elephants in the forest"

This is taken form the Dhammapada, which is an essential text from Buddhist tradition. It basically means that you need to be critical when assessing a situation. Don't let your own inner desires and wants cloud your judgement, and regardless of the outcome, remain clam, and level-headed. Further more, the original text has a line regarding the company you keep. It suggests that it's better to be alone than to be with fools, as you'll surely become a fool yourself. I think it's also discussing the training needed in order to reach a state of enlightenment. Enlightenment in Buddhist terms is about reaching a state of inner peace, and having no wants or desires. The quote mentions only having few wishes, which is why it's about a transitional state. You still have desires, but you're trying to minimise them in order to attain enlightenment. That's why when Batou asks Motoko "Are you happy", she doesn't answer directly, and instead says "A nostalgic value, perhaps. At least I am free of qualms...". It's easier to understand when taken in context to the original source, but, I can't start delving into Buddhist teachings any more than I just have, and I'm certainly not qualified to do so.

"Who can gaze into the mirror without becoming evil? The mirror does not reflect evil, but creates it."

This is based on a quote you'll all be more familiar with: "He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee." It's basically saying to be carful when it comes to the extremes we'll go to in order to achieve our goals. In this case, it's talking about a mirror. Why? Because Locus Solus creates dolls. Dolls made in the image of man. They've resorted to kidnapping and ghost dubbing in order to make their dolls closer to being human. When you think about it, ghost dubbing is a pretty monstrous crime. By straining to create the perfect copy of man, Locus Solus has done terrible things.

"life and death come and go like marionettes dancing on a table. Once their strings are cut, they easily crumble."

Christ. Okay. I think this is basically addressing mortality, and how easily our identify changes. Let's face it: this film is about Batou, a man who has essentially replaced all the things that made him human physically, with artificial elements. Hell, the only human thing that remains with him is his ghost, something that even Motoko questioned in the first film. The man is a cyborg, or better yet, a doll.
It's ironic to suggest that these super-powered cyborgs could be so frail, like a marionettes, but at the end of the day, these cyborgs are still human, and still have very human limitations mentally, if not physically. The only thing pulling Batou's strings is his own mind. Something which Kim hacks and disorientates. The only thing Batou can really call his own, is his ghost. His body may be a doll, but in a world where we could so easily swap our body-parts, they can no longer define us. Physical image can no longer define us. His mind is his identity, and if we sever the mind, the doll crumbles.

Well, I HOPE that helped answer a few questions and put the film into perspective for you, but if anything remains unclear, by all means, ask in the comments and I'll do my best to help clarify. This was a lot harder to write than my first summary, mainly because I know the first film much better, and the quotes and references in this film make it pretty tricky to tackle. Again, if I've screwed up and gotten something wrong, I apologise, but please explain it fully so that we'll all know for the future!

If this film completely threw you off, then PLEASE don't skip the SAC rewatch. The series is much more of a crime-thriller and doesn't have the same heavy atmosphere and philosophical tones that these two films have. Honestly, it's okay if you couldn't really get into the films, but missing the series would be a real shame (although I consider the first film to be a fucking masterpiece).

I'm at Creamfields next weekend so I won't be able to join-in with the discussions for the first episodes, but I'll be here for the rest (although I'm not doing a summary for each bloody episode like this!). Hope you've enjoyed these first two films, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

EDIT: Reddit gold?! You guys are too kind!
>> ARTICLE
Can you explain the proverbial quotes they discuss on the aircraft to the frontier. I remember one was from Milton and the other from the bible. I couldn't make much of it; it sounded like philosophical mumbo jumbo. Something about twisted external memory
>> ARTICLE
Sure, I'll give it a shot.

First up: "How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them! If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand."

Okay, this is a Psalm from the Old Testament and Togusa is using it out of context. In context, the speaker is declaring god's wisdom to be boundless. it comes just after another line which explains how god has already predetermined the course of all our lives. How god has basically dictated fate.

We hear this just after Batou gets through explaining that cities and society are essentially the physical manifestation of our own external memory. If life can be reduced to genes and DNA, which are essentially just memory systems, then these cities we create and fill with books, and servers housing immense amounts of knowledge, data and people are basically acting as our own giant external memory.

Personally, I think Togusa is being sarcastic when he uses this line. He looks uninterested in the conversation, shrugs-off Batou's reference to a theory that the structures we create reflect our personalities, and then throws in this quote of his own, mocking Batou, sarcastically thanking him for imparting his 'godly wisdom'.

And Second: "Angel forms, who lay entranced, thick as autumnal leaves. Nine days they fell, confounded chaos roared."

Okay, this one I don't really have much to go on, but it's taking lines from two different poetic works by Milton, both referencing the Angels which fell from heaven and became Satan's legion during the rebellion against god. Togusa says this right after we get some long, picturesque shots of what is basically a giant techno-cathedral. It might be that Togusa is expressing his disapproval for how technology and information has almost become sacred in this future, and is likening the mostly abandoned towers of the Northern Frontier to fallen angels. This disapproval would fit Togusa's character quite well, as he's the one member of Section 9 who has attempted to keep his body as human as possible and minimise any cybernetic modifications. That's why Batou then says "I got news for you; we're not Satan", as if to disagree with Togusa that our advances in cybernetic body modifications have turned us into demons.

So yeah, that's what I personally get from those quotes. Might be clutching at straws a little, but they don't give you much to go on. All I can really do is try to understand what the quotes actually mean in context, then consider what I know about these characters, and try to form an idea of how they work in this new context.

Hope this helps, and by all means, let me know what you think, or if you disagree!
>> ARTICLE
Man, thanks for taking the time to make a significant response. These threads and your analyses have gotten me to watch both movies and just now starting the second episode of SAC. But, back to those quotes, yea that wouldn't be a ridiculous deduction. Sometimes it's just amusing at some levels hearing dialogue like, "The bird does not feed on the green persimmon. It waits for the fruit to open." It's interesting how they played with mechanical dolls in the second film, considering it's believed that Descartes carried around a life-sized doll. 
>> ARTICLE
No sweat. I'm glad you've been enjoying them so far. And yeah, some of the quotes they pull out during Innocence are really obscure, or so far removed from their original context that you really need to sit and think before they can start to make even a fraction of sense, but then that's part of the fun for me.

I think the whole appeal of these films for me is that the subject matter they're dealing with isn't actually THAT farfetched. If we continue making the same strides in technology that we have been in recent years, it's possible that we might have to seriously consider answering some of the questions these films present.

And all the stuff about Dolls in Innocence is especially interesting as it could become more and more relevant as time goes on. There's an awful lot of money invested in robotics these days, and sex-dolls would undoubtedly have a big market (hell, just look at Realdolls), so if we get the robotics part down, and then make significant leaps in AI, we're practically there. Well, maybe not on the whole Ghost-Dubbing part, but still, could you imagine the scandal if a sentient AI was forced into a sex-doll? We'd have to rewrite the law books for that type of stuff.
>> ARTICLE
That was awesome. Thank you so much for the explanation and dissection of the plot! 
>> ARTICLE
No problem. I had a lot of fun writing this, and I'm glad people have found it useful!
>> ARTICLE
> Batou, a man who has essentially replaced all the things that made him human physically, with artificial elements. Hell, the only human thing that remains with him is his ghost

Is that true?  I thought he was just enhanced with a lot of replacements, not full-body-prosthetic like the Major.  Also, I thought a lot of them were previous-generation equipment (explaining why his eyes are funky).
>> ARTICLE
You've got me second-guessing myself now haha.
You're right though, he's not gone as far as Kusanagi did. I'm under the impression that his body is still mostly cybernetic replacements though. I guess I went too far when I said that the only thing left that's still him is his ghost, but I was doing so more to try and get the point across.
I'll check it out when I get home later, as I'm actually pretty curious myself now.
>> ARTICLE
I know you said you don't want to do any more write ups on the series but man if you could even do a mini write up or share your thoughts on the main points of "IN: Kusanagi's Labyrinth  AFFECTION" which is episode 11 of S.A.C. 2nd GIG I would absolutely love to read it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll see what I can do. Honestly I haven't watched SAC in a long time, so I was going to use this rewatch as a chance to refresh myself on the series.
I'll either wait until we get there in the rewatch and type something up, or I'll jump ahead a bit and PM you or something, so as not to post spoilers for people who've not seen it yet.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that would be awesome, but take your time. I just really enjoy your well written posts on GitS. Definitely one of the bests parts of the current rewatch.

Man. 

*Awesome!*

And thanks for the post, too. It's pretty great.

My pleasure. I'm glad people have been finding them helpful!
>> ARTICLE
I definitely remember having no idea what to think after I came off my first watch of Innocence. I wish I had this to read all those years back.

We're doing an 'end of season' discussion thread for each of SAC's seasons. If you still wanted to put down a big analysis of what just happened, that might be nice play to post something that ties it all together.

Whether or not you want to put any more big efforts in, you've been the best part of these threads.
>> ARTICLE
As an aside:  why are we watching these out of order?  I feel like people would understand and appreciate this movie a lot more if viewed in chronological release order (after _GitS:SAC_ and _GitS:SAC 2nd Gig_).
>> ARTICLE
I wanted to watch through each continuity before moving onto the next one.

Why I paced the two films each a week apart from each other and SAC, I have no idea anymore. I wouldn't advise this schedule to anyone who wanted to do another rewatch in the future. If I planned it again we'd maybe go 1995->SAC->Innocence->2ndGig->SolidStateSociety, with very limited breaks to space it out.

Innocence actually seems to have been screened in the middle of 2nd Gig's airing (according to MAL). It is a very different entry in the franchise and I'm honestly not sure where it is appropriate to place it if you wanted it to have to best impact relative to a viewers first experience with GitS.
>> ARTICLE
Aw shucks. I just like GitS is all.

And it's not that I wouldn't want to keep posting these, but I just wouldn't have the time. At the very least I'll still be involved in the upcoming discussions. Maybe I'll write another big post for the end of each season like you suggested.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for this explanation, it really helps. Especially for someone that just watched this and was mainly thinking "What the fuck is going on, it looks really good, but seriously what the fuck is going on."
>> ARTICLE
It was my first time seeing this, but I didn't feel lost at all  then again I've seen _GitS:SAC_ and _GitS:SAC 2nd Gig_ a couple of times each.
>> ARTICLE
Mate, that's why the first question I answered is "What. The. Fuck?"

This film is gorgeous, but it's often overlooked because of the way it tackles its subject matter.

Glad I could help!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, i'm happy you answered that question. Even though i share your opinion on the first movie being better, its still nice to have some sort of understanding of this beautiful movie as well.
>> ARTICLE
The first time watching this movie I was completely lost too. GitS universe is just so dam cool. I like this movie better than the others really. It's a shame it's so underrated. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked this movie a lot more than the previous one.  I liked the pairing of Batou and Togusa a lot more than Motoko and Batou.  All the philosophical stuff felt a lot more natural this time around; none of it felt forced to me.  There was less of the running and gunning SMG-filled action, and no miraculous bullet dodging from a tank.  I particularly liked how Batou was trying to conserve his ammo and fired single-shot at the very end.

I'd say my favorite scene was the virtual maze.  I thought that the Hebrew text would be different and would lead to Batou realizing what was going on, but the actual changes were great.  I was creeped out when I noticed that Kim made himself look like Togusa.

Compared to the first movie, where I didn't enjoy most of the film but really liked the ending, this time around I really enjoyed most of the movie, but didn't care as much for the ending.  Basically, as soon as Motoko showed up it felt weaker.  And once again she destroys an arm by trying to open something.  At least she actually got it open this time and only lost one arm, and it was just a throw-away body too.

The scene where Batou fed his dog (...did it ever get a name?) was great too.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to hear you found it easier to get into this one! For most people it's the other way around, but Innocence is definitely a cool film. An awful lot of attentions was given to small details in this film, such as Batou switching to firing single rounds as he gets low on ammo, like you mentioned. It's worth watching it again some time as you'll most likely pick-up on bits you didn't notice the first time around.

Oh, and the dog's name is Gabriel, although I don't think it's ever named in the film.
>> ARTICLE
Well, if that wasn't one hell of a ride. Thank gods that /u/AcidOctopus is with us to clear all the remaining ambiguities ;)

I felt really sceptical at the beginning of the movie, mainly because of the abundance of CGI (which looked rather unreal and... underwhelming coupled with traditional animation), but when you get past this, this movie is real fun to dissect in search for its meaning (and it had some thrilling action sequences, too). I think the difference in atmosphere compared to the previous installment put me off a little and my opinion would've been higher had this been a stand-alone movie. Still, I found the main motif - machines imitating life, or living machines - interesting.

Again, GitS references a lot of other works, even more than before, but since I'm not into classical literature, I was content with picking just the *Blade Runner* references :D The dog was definitely one of them - if you watched (or read) BR, you probably remember that artificial animals played an important role in its symbolism. I was actually convinced that the dog was artificial, too (the music box scene almost cried it out loud), but it turns out it was a clone - which makes it (almost) the real thing, depending on how you look at it.

The movie asks questions that we won't have to bother answering until we develop sentient AI's ourselves... That's why it's quite difficult to draw some sort of conclusion from it. Are dolls more 'perfect' than humans? Certainly not, in my opinion. The effect of uncanny valley invoked in me by these robots tells me as much :P But can a mind without a living body be considered a living being? That's a completely different question...
>> ARTICLE
You've hit the nail on the head. I love this film  (and the first) partially because it asks questions that definitely have answers, but haven't been fully answered yet.

I really hope AI takes significant steps forward during my lifetime so that we can see just how it all turns out.
>> ARTICLE
This was really good. First time seeing it ad I just found out about it a week ago. I know the first film was a classic, but I think this one is up there. It's not as good,  but it's still a really great film. Wondering why this film doesn't get the same recognition as the first one.  I checked around and I don't even see a recently released copy of it. Hasn't the original been release a couple of times in the last few years? 
>> ARTICLE
This second film is often overlooked because of the subject matter and the way it approaches it.
A lot of people feel it tries too hard to be philosophical, and thus comes off as pretentious.
Regardless of whether or not it has philosophical merit, it at least makes appropriate use of quotes and references. Every quote in the film actually has relevance to the plot, so while some people may find it contrived, at the very least, it makes sense.
I adore this film, so I'm really hoping this rewatch will help it gain a few more fans.
>> ARTICLE
Admittedly I didn't think about every quote, but I thought what was said matched the atmosphere of the scene. I had no issues with it,  however it just gives the audience another reason to rewatch it. I'd call it a must see if you watched the original, glad it was included in the rewatch 
>> ARTICLE
I think of it as ambitious. There's not much out there that asks the same sort of questions, and tackles them in the same way. All the quotes certainly aid the narrative (even if they do make it difficult to follow), and the underlining questions are increasingly relevant (to me at least).
In an age where we're becoming so focused on technology, it's important to consider the social, moral, ethical and philosophical impacts of our advances in A.I, cybernetics, and our identity as a species.
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully it's popularity will increase with the new surge of interest for the ghost in the Shell franchise 
>> ARTICLE
One of the more curious aspects of this film is the exclusion of GitS' iconic insectoid [*'think tank'*](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7d/23/b8/7d23b8b828394c9fbc2396f49262c98e.jpg) mechs. 

This isn't so interesting in the context of being a sequel to the 1995 film, where there is only the single large [think tank that Motoko fights](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbxlivM1r81rijl8go1_1280.png). However Innocence was released after Stand Alone Complex had already aired its first season. As popular as the 1995 film was, the manga had cemented those mech designs in the minds of it's fans and SAC had aimed to make damn sure no one would forget them. Hell, the Ghost in the Shell 1997 playstation game was literally nothing but [Fuchikoma](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101030172820/ghostintheshell/en/images/7/73/Fuchikoma-toy.jpg) insect mech warfare. Think tanks are as much a part of GitS as any other component. And yet even so, the wasp shaped helicopters and beetle tanks are nowhere to be found in Mamoru Oshii's Innocence.

As /u/AcidOctopus mentions in his write up, Innocence draws hugely on the theme of blurring lines between man, doll and machine. I think he made the concious decision to absolutely exclude them so as to further drive home this film's ideas. Keeping AI controlled machines limited to a strictly humanoid form reinforces the idea of man attempting to play god with life built in his own image.

The unique imagery that Ghost in the Shell usually features had to be pushed to the side. And for the direction the Oshii wanted to take his film, this was for the best. They would have undermined what he wanted to achieved.

Probably, I think, this is why Innocence doesn't spring to mind as readily when discussing the franchise. As thematically on point as it is with respect to the rest of the series, Innocence simply doesn't include the staple icons one would expect it to have. Which is a shame, because Innocence does not deserve to be forgettable.
>> ARTICLE
Damn. This never even occurred to me. I think you're probably 100% correct.
The tank in the first film is pretty iconic, so you'd probably have expected it to be in the sequel, but the absence of any non-humanoid robots and such definitely helps keep the lines between man and machine pretty ambiguous.
Thanks for pointing this out!
>> ARTICLE
At the start of the movie I was able to follow everything easily so I was pretty happy and then Batou suddenly started shooting in the convenience store and after that my understanding quickly went downhill, I actually had to often pause and think for a few minutes about what the hell they were talking about whenever they went philosophical.

Eventually I decided to ignore the philosophical parts and focus only on what is happening and after that I started enjoying ythe movie a lot more. I actually like this movie more than the first one, even though there isn't enough Motoko in this one (though the scene where he puts his jacket on her was great). 


The visuals for the cyborgs from the first movie were better than in this one though imo but I really loved the animation for the Batou's dog, this might sound strange but seriously the dog was my favorite part of the movie. I thought it was the most life-like dog I've seen in anime so far.

Not much else to say except that I'm looking forward to the series.
>> ARTICLE
> I thought it was the most life-like dog I've seen in anime so far.

So I wasn't the only one! Something about that dog was pretty fucking great. Even when it was resting on his lap.
>> ARTICLE
It's cool that you picked-up on the dog. It's intentionally supposed to be the most "natural" thing in the film. It's a completely natural organism in stark contrast to all the artificial elements of the world it's in.
>> ARTICLE
After making my post I read your 2 posts and thought "oh so that is why the dog is so well animated", thank you for the insight.

It is too bad you won't be making huge posts like these for each episode because they are really helpful and I like reading them but I can see you spend a lot of time on them and doing it for each episode would be a huge amount of work.


Thank you for the info dumps :)
>> ARTICLE
No sweat. It's only because I'm passionate about GitS that I did them in the first place. Hell, I've got their data-ports tattoo'd onto the back of my neck =p

I'd love to be able to do a proper analysis like these for each of the episodes of the series, but I just don't have the time. That, and the episodes don't really need an explanation like these. That would be overkill.

Glad I could help though! Hopefully you stick with the series ^_^
>> ARTICLE
Well, I have to say, this was even more _Blade Runner_-ey than the first movie.  Both as in eye candy and as in existential themes.


>> ARTICLE
Jesus Christ this movie looks amazing.

Surprisingly I found this movie easier to follow than the first one. I remembered the supermarket scene being really fucking well animated, and actually the whole movie was just a treat.

The whole reason they like to throw around quotes is cause they're just Googling them all the time. Every character has this dry look on their face like they know what's coming up.

Man I love this movie just as much as Oshii-san loves basset hounds.

I honestly didn't really understand why the movie is so hyped but after I rewatched halfway through SAC, I enjoyed it a lot more. The characters aren't just random characters; you know who they are and you know their roles.

Ok, fixed the tables. Sorry about that.

>Episode Type  
  
I-Is that what Stand Alone Complex means?
>> ARTICLE
Nah, that is just how the episodes are divided up. *Stand Alone* episodes are mostly self contained, while *Complex* episodes solely focus on the season's overarching plot. 2nd Gig has a similar system, with *Dividual* for stand alone episodes, *Individual* for core, and *Dual* for the secondary plot.

I initially thought of suggesting that people who are more time pressured could get away with just watching the *Complex* episodes, but I ended up concluding that too many important themes would be skipped out on that way.

The actual idea of "Stand Alone Complex" has quite a cool meaning/definition, but I think it would spoil part of the show to explain it so early.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. 
I am a complete Ghost in a shell n00b and I still have no idea what "episode type" means. Can you simplify it please?

Don't worry too much about it. If you watch them in order everything will make sense. The episode type just gives an indication as to what kind of story content to expect in an episode.

>> ARTICLE
Now for the question us first-timers are dying to know:

Sub or dub?
>> ARTICLE
Sub!
>> ARTICLE
The dub is very serviceable, but there are a lot of scenes where I feel the english cast simply had no idea what the hell sort of emotions they were supposed to be conveying. This isn't really their fault, as the script is pretty far from human experience, but it lets down key moments.

Saying that, I prefer the dub. 

The Japanese cast was better directed, but the english cast are the same actors who did the Stand Alone Complex dub. I'm too familiar with those voices as those characters. Even if they aren't perfect.

I won't be able to necessarily follow that schedule (I'll probably be watching some episodes over the weekend but have no time during the week), but I'll definitively be commenting on the episodes thread as long as its fine if its a first watch instead of a rewatch :)

I was hoping we'd have plenty of first watchers giving their impressions. Definitely ok for you to comment if it is your first time through the show. A lot of the highlights from the threads come from new watchers speculating on where things will go.

Fate/Stay night from DEEN is listed higher than Fate/UBW from ufotable? ^^^jesus^christ
>> ARTICLE
Haven't watched any of Fate series, can anyone tell me why is Fate/Stay night so hated while everyone loves the other series?
>> ARTICLE
Um....its complicated. 

The F/Sn that is hated is the 2006 version. Its considered a very poor adaptation of the Fate route of the F/Sn visual nove,especially in regards to the protagonist. It has plot points and spoilers from the 2 other routes, and because of mixing up all those it suffers from pacing issues.Also the animation is very poor and hasn't stood the test of time.

The other 2 series are F/Sn Unlimited Blade Works- which adapts the 2nd route of the VN very faithfully and is a great anime overall. And Fate/Zero- which is the prequel of the F/Sn anime, and is considered one of the top tier animes to come out in the last 5 years.

There are other stuff related to the Fate franchise- Fate/Kaleid which is an alternate universe thingy but still loads of fun apparently, the Unlimited Blade Works movie which is made by the same studio of the 2006 version and also considered pretty bad adaptation unlike the newer series.

Hope that was helpful!
>> ARTICLE
so if i want to start watching fate what order would you recommend?
>> ARTICLE
So basically it is hated because DEEN fucked it up. I just started watching it(going to watch whole franchise), and i can understand why it gets all the flak. The animation quality is by far the worst in any anime i've seen(haven't seen that many, i'm more of a manga guy). 

The overall production is just piss-poor by not just the standarts of 2006 but even the entere 2000s.

Your comment was very helpful, thanks for taking time to answer me!

PS: A couple episodes in and i see why Saber's the best girl.

Yeah, DEEN certainly dropped the ball on this series. So it kind of deserves the criticism it receives.

Saber romance brah, people love it, and Japan loves Saber.  I wouldn't go so far as to put F/SN above UBW.... but I can definitely see the appeal of it.  Saber's romance arc is still touching, even if it wasn't adapted exactly as the VN had it.

Yeah I like Saber she's awesome and all but, Rin is so much more interesting, fun, and a strong female lead.

Nuuuuuuu
>> ARTICLE
Saber's romance was not only horrible but her character is just asinine. She's like the least likable character in that show, and I will never understand why she's popular. Fate Route was horribly average, and it should only be slated as average. UBW and HF are incredibly better, and so are their heroines. I'm probably going to get down voted for this but whatever, I just can't stand her nor her nonsense. 

In my opinion:

Heaven's Feel > UBWRoute > UBW Anime > A ton of shit(including FZ) > Fate Route >>> Fate Anime >>>> UBW Movie

Tell me how you really feel.

I guess I'll just summon /u/darthnick426 and get it over with.

There's literally no point in debating with someone with such obviously bad taste.  Just let him stew in his own edgy salt.

>> ARTICLE
At this point, it's just different taste, not bad. It doesn't mean that you like Saber that you have bad taste, just not the same taste as me. The contrary can also be applied. While I did say that I did not understand why someone would like a character like Saber,  I never judged anyone who actually did. 

We are talking about fictional characters at the end of the day. People will dislike some, and others will dislike others. I may disrespect a character and you can too, but there's literally no reason to disrespect each other because of our divergent tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
> Saber's romance was not only horrible but her character is just asinine. She's like the least likable character in that show, and I will never understand why she's popular. 

This entire statement is contrary to what you just said. By making this claim you are judging her popularity and by extension judging why people like her. If you were just talking about the character, then sure, your earlier statement you stated rings true but you went and said you'll never understand her popularity. That undermines your entire argument man. So even if you didn't mean to judge people for liking her you've unintentionally implied that and mostly come off as someone who's just annoyed with Saber fans for making her popular.

I was mostly joking for the most part anyway. Saber is indeed my favorite and I banter often that the other girls are shit but I'm joking at the end of the day for the fun of it. I like or at least appreciate basically every character in the Fate Franchise. Except for Shinji. Fuck that guy.

You must be new to anime, If you're the MC you can do whatever you want to your romance option and it does not matter

Its the culture difference I suppose
>> ARTICLE
No I'm not new to anime. I don't think anyone who actually seen a 40+ hour visual novel is new to anime. He treats her like shit, and like the shallow veggie she is, act as if it bothers her but does nothing about it. Her apparent growth was extremely shallow and sexist all things considered. So much that I will not consider it growth but digression. I feel like Saber is an insult to actually strong female characters. She can fight, but she doesn't have the mentality that makes a character strong. 

Sakura also doesn't have it, but she got an interest enough character conflict that I can look past it. Her personality is also pretty well rounded. Rin is just extremely badass in terms of personality and is a character who's portrayed much better than most women in such fiction. She's ultimately perfect.  
>> ARTICLE
And the MC is just bad in general, doesn't make saber any worse. 

Rin is perfect you say, so saber is missing the tsundere ? 
>> ARTICLE
Rin Tohsaka. (I made an essay or something like that about Rin a long time ago, so here)

Rin is without a doubt the deuteragonist of FSN. For a character usually known as a tsundere she is one of the most complex characters in the Fate Series. She has many layers. First, in her day to day, we see the perfect student persona. This way, she keeps herself away from the normals so she doesn't have to hurt them if they find her secret. Then we see how she behaves once she relaxes a bit, with Ayako. And we see a person who is witty and likes have verbal fights while maintaining a facade of elegance and aloofness. Behind that, we discover the cold magus that she likes to think she is. That's it, until Shirou breaks through that layer like a sledgehammer (punny) and we finally see the tsundere. And that's not even her final layer. Once Shirou (and the watchers/readers) see whats behind her magus persona, we see a character with flaws, flaws that in my case endear her to me even more. She is stingy, has a short temper, is lazy and weak in the mornings, isn't honest with herself about her feelings, is a bit of a manipulator and likes to make fun of other people.  


But she also likes to have a challenge, has a very high sense of fair play at the beginning (whatever advantages she gets after the start is another matter), wants to keep the innocents around her safe, takes her responsibilities seriously, is very intelligent and, above all, incredibly funny. She is the character with whom I laugh the most in the novel/anime. And behind all of that, we find her true persona. A kind person. In my opinion, probably the kindest character in FSN, by far (probably Sakura is the only one who is somehow close, but not that close. Again, this is my opinion). She is compassionate, and despite her words, thinks of the others around her before herself (but in a much more balanced way than Shirou, she knows to keep the balance that is her own person safe so she can measure things, to somehow use her words). 


It helps to bring my opinion of her higher that, without having a really game breaking ability (besides being a genius magus, and in a war like the HGW that doesn't help that much when you face some of the monsters of the war) or being overpowered to the max, she can take names and kick asses, even when completely overwhelmed [Spoiler](/s "oh, hello there, Caster, let me introduce you to my FIST TO THE KISSER!"). Oh, and she is cute. I can't forget to mention that. 


Rin's case is a strange one for me. I'm usually a sword and childhood friend person, and I favor the underdogs over the stars, but Rin came, looked at Saber and Sakura (sword in the first case and underdog and childhood friend in the second) and kicked them out of the ladder. Hard. And with hard I mean harder than what  [Spoiler](/s "Herk ")could do. Although Sakura managed to get near it with time. [Spoiler](/s "I blame her shadow induced almost omnipotence cheating to let her recover, or something. And Hollow Ataraxia, can't forget about that.")

>> ARTICLE
Also Saber is shit because she's shit. Shirou was shit in Fate route too, but it was how she related to him in that route that brung her character down with him. Her relationship with him, her own basic character and her asinine growth are what made her a horrible character. HA improved their relationship but sadly, her character stayed as basic as before. 
>> ARTICLE
So.....

TL;DR You like Rin as your waifu because you pretty much skimmed over Sakura as quickly as you could despite her desire and motivations literally being the most complicated of the series

Cool
>> ARTICLE
So, she is complex cause she is the average tsundere that is prideful, tough, and kind underneath. Gotcha. Makes her perfect. Gotcha.

In that end, she was portrayed as this horrible women who dared to defy her men. Ultimately, she was portrayed as if she was in the wrong for killing him, and that she was a horrible person for doing so. 

Not to forget that I stated that:


and like the shallow veggie she is, act as if it bothers her but does nothing about it.


I really want to point the fact that I stated that she acted as if it bothered but did not do anything to dissolve her relationship with Shirou, instead, she decided to hop on the very person who treated her like an uncapable piece of shit. 
>> ARTICLE
That is the connotation you have given to that ending or even that conversation. Instead I see it as an act of an independent person that has the right to chose but it is in a position where she personally doesn't feel comfortable with the outcome because of all the time they spent together.
Furthermore, the way Shirou acted was because ofhis PTSD and survivor guilt than Saber understood because she saw his past.
He was the first to treat her as a person, unlike Britain or Kiritsugu. (Well Iri classifies but because she had the same condition as her)

Spirited away not in the top 100

If Kinema Junpo polls are anything to go by, Japanese cinephiles prefer early Miyazaki to late Miyazaki, with *Castle of Cagliostro* being regarded as the best animated film.

Japan is huge on Laputa, Castle in the Sky. It's a popular film to show to children, significantly moreso than the Miyazaki Monoliths of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke (which are too confusing or too violent for young children).

Well it's the highest grossing film of all time in Japan, so there's at least that going for it.

I'm surprised Cowboy Bebop is rated higher there than it is on MAL. I always assumed that show had more western appeal.
>> ARTICLE
I believe it did have an initial poor rating, but still managed to be a commercial and critical success in Japan despite the poor start.
>> ARTICLE
That's a misconception that stems from Cowboy Bebop having a number of issues when it first aired in Japan. The series is very popular over there, it's considered a global sensation for a reason.

It was even the Animage Anime Grand Prix runner-up and Editor's Choice winner when it came out, so it wasn't exactly under the radar even back then.

Sorry. Too many anime, and I want to keep the list short.

What I find as few surprises on this: 

* Ga-Rei: Zero is relatively high
* Revolutionary Girl Utena is still in the high 200s
* GATE I thought was a big hit, guess I was thinking wrong
* Legend of the Galactic Heroes is **not** in the top 100
* School Days is in the top 200
* Jojo, OPM, and NHK are in the 300s
>> ARTICLE
GATE had a good premise, but the harem aspect just got really grating after a while. It felt really forced and added nothing to the story. Also having a female character, that looked like a pre-teen, go into a weird orgasmic trance whenever there was a slaughter got really gross really fast... (=_=)
>> ARTICLE
I don't think those are the reasons it is not rated as good in Japan, nobody complains about harems or goth loli goddesses. It's much more likely it's about the Anime toning down the violence and not being true to the source thus fans of either the web or the light novel or the manga not rating the adaptation high.
>> ARTICLE
The violence was also toned down from the manga which had toned it down from the LN, so being a sub-par adaptation might have something to do with it.  It's also rather nationalistic, which could make the current target audience uncomfortable.
>> ARTICLE
Where could I read the Light Novels in English? I'd like to read what the author had in mind with the violence
>> ARTICLE
I'm not into LN's so I couldn't tell ya.  Even if I knew I'd probably have to pm you the site because I doubt it's legal.
>> ARTICLE
I will add that even the LN isn't strictly the original as there was a novel before that (but there shouldn't be much of a difference).

Someone seems to have picked it up. Check Bakatsuki (I'm not sure if fan-translations count as piracy on this sub so use some google-fu). Someone has translated the first book and are working on the 2nd one. 
>> ARTICLE
I think NHK hit too close to home for many viewers. It's hard to be objective about a show if it makes you gaze deep within yourself in a brutally effective way. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's not forget FMAB is ranked 30. 
>> ARTICLE
Because it doesn't take place in Japan.

Joke aside, it would be meaningless to compare both websites if they don't weight the scores the same way. On MAL you need to have at least watch 20% of the anime for your score to have weight. If on Anikore your score counts without even asking how many episodes you have watched (I don't know that) then it would be meaningless to do a comparison. 

There's also the fact that they might calculate the score differently. MAL only takes the overall score in consideration, while Anikore might not.
>> ARTICLE
> Ga-Rei: Zero

It is a fantastic thriller IMO.
>> ARTICLE
the pocky scene was thrilling for sure
>> ARTICLE
> Legend of the Galactic Heroes is not in the top 100

Probably because the rating system on MAL means only people that have watched 24+ episodes of LoGH have their scores taken into account.

So let me get this straight. They think that the Studio DEEN adaptation is better than both seasons of UBW. They also think that the UBW MOVIE by DEEN (The one with [this gem of a battle](http://i.imgur.com/93g3sId.jpg)) is better than the second season of UBW.

Sasuga, Japan. I bet the Saberfags are the cause of this.

I mean, the Fate route is the Saber romance route, and therefore the best route with best girl, and Japan loves Saber... so it's not that surprising.

This is what makes me scared to watch the Seven Deadly Sins anime adaptation.  Manga is super fun, but the anime looks half-assed.  I hope i'm wrong.

I watched it, and IMHO it's very well done. I heard some manga readers say they cut a bit off and changed some parts, but that's to be expected in an adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Seven Deadly Sins never having read the manga, and I thought it was very well-done. The humor, pacing, and animation were consistent, and the scope of the world-building and battles was really impressive.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't read the manga but it seemed fine to me, didn't have horrible pacing or quality issues from what I can tell.
>> ARTICLE
Give it a try, its a pretty fantastic series IMO. Manga readers in the discussion threads also said it was a relatively faithful adaption, only shuffling around events and cutting some details (to fit ~100 chapters into a 24 episode run) when absolutely necessary to maintain a sound narrative.
>> ARTICLE
Well, from all the positive feedback just from this i'll probably give it a go this weekend!  Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Thats wrong... the anime is also ridiculously popular. One of the maybe 5 anime you can truly consider mainstream. Is in the top 5 for anime TV ratings every week.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it's popular (although less popular than the manga), the "not so much" was meant more for the quality aspect (I mean, the anime certanly has it's moments, but over time it really lost the hang of it).
>> ARTICLE
last time I watched it, the anime consisted of 10 mins of new content and the rest of recaps, filler content (like the voice intro and stuff), OP and ED. and the animation is...well...Toei (nothing more needs to be said here)

If it got any worse then may god have mercy on the anime viewer's sole. 

EDIT:
>sole 

I am not changing that lol
>> ARTICLE
The early parts were actually pretty good, yeah they had recaps but you could generally skip them and have a good time. The thing is that they started to make each episode the equivalent of 1 manga chapter, and it's absolutely impossible to do so, things just got so slow and the pacing went to shit, along wiht the animation quality, nowadays it's just...not good...(though I have to admit they shine in the important bits)
>> ARTICLE
As a Japanese, I guess that voters who use this site is almost all of the "anime" otaku and they don't treat One Piece as an anime. Beyond that, that is the most popular/selling manga in Japan, so the manga is more popular than the anime and the fans mostly have read only manga just like FMA:B,HxH,JOJO... imo. Sorry if it was hard to read.

Out of curiosity, did you watch Castle in the Sky subbed or dubbed? Also, which would you recommend if you have seen both?

Subbed, but dubs for Ghibli movies tend to be good. I watched the old one first and then the remake just to see what has changed. Almost everything in the old one is in the new version as well. If you do not care for comparing, then you will be fine with the new one. But personally, it is a fun thing to do and the old one is not that bad.

One of the problems though with that is both Gintama and Gintama' are both on it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not just nostalgia. It was a very competent adaptation, especially for the time. In terms of animation quality both are stellar and the 1999 adaptation holds up pretty damn well.

I think what bumps the 1999 up a notch is the tone set by the use of color and sound. It used muted colors which suited the darker direction Hunter X Hunter eventually moved into (with body part traficking, gangsters, assassins, murder, and eventually drugs and cannibalism all being major parts of the story), while the 2011 adaptation continued to use the bright saturated palette that suited the series early on, but less so with every arc. Since both adaptations are highly competent, similar to FMA vs. FMA:Brotherhood situation, the Japanese audience probably rated the older one higher because the tone was more in-line with what is depicted in the story.

I actually really hate that comic because it ignores all context of the situation to make Shinji look like a bigger bitch than he is. 

By piloting that robot Shinji's mental state lowers because he's fighting shit you would see in nightmares all while feeling the pain himself (Not to mention that it sometimes goes Berserk harming him/his friends/ random people further fucking him up mentally), Misato is a slobby alcoholic who wouldn't sleep with him anyways because she views him as a child, Asuka genuinely hates him and she's a bitch anyways, and Rei [Evangelion](/s "is his sister/mother.")

Like if they left out the first panel I would have taken the comic's comedy at face value, but they include that so it just seems like a shitty argument saying Eva is shit.

You are telling me that one of the most influential series to be ever created, and what is till today the best selling anime release of all time, shouldn't be in the top 100?

I love Eva and I realize it's not everyone's cup of tea, but we are not talking about top 10 or top 3, but top 100. 

If you don't think Eva deserves a spot in the top 100, then I don't know what you think should. 

I would ask you to name 100 titles better than Eva, but that would be a waste of my time and yours.

#triggered

I can name 100 animes that has an actual ending which would beat Eva *tv* series. Also I've seen eva before I've seen the internet so I know what going vanilla into the series is like, and it feels like "It would've been better series if it had better ending and mc".
>> ARTICLE
I think most people who have watched 100 anime can name 100 anime with subjectively better endings than Evangelion, that doesn't make the characters, plot, animation, or aesthetic any worse
>> ARTICLE
but characters are badly written/generic, plot is conclusionless, animation goes to hell as show progresses and aesthetic is probably the strongest point.
>> ARTICLE
Actually The World of Golden Eggs is the best selling anime release of all time (don't ask me why, not a damn clue), Evangelion is 2nd ;P

Though, SAO will probably pass it in the near future (if it hasn't already) if we are including all season volumes.
>> ARTICLE
I'll do you one better: Evangelion should absolutely be cemented in the top 3 anime of all time and it's a crying shame that many people don't see it that way.

influential doesn't necessarily = best. I don't think the original eva tv series should be in the top 100 either, on it's own it really isn't that amazing.

The ones that really surprised me with their spots are True Tears, Nausicaa, Nagi no Asukara, and Chihayafuru.

I thought the general perception of True Tears was quite awful even though it's one of my personal favorites so it being placed in the top 100 was a shock. Nausicaa, for obvious reasons. As for Nagi no Asukara and Chihayafuru... I'm just glad they have a high ranking cause both of them are true hidden gems. Nagi no Asukara was perceived well and is very well liked on the sub so I'm not that surprised, but Chihayafuru in top 10 was unexpected.

I think its one of the best shonen. Not the best action anime seeing as **spoiler alert** everyone dies in one punch, which is extremely lackluster in the practical sense. However as a whole: comedy, production, sound, visual entertainment, action, and concept it is certainly an anime worthy of praise and prestige.

This happens all the time. People dislike it when people like things they don't, so they *must* voice their opinion as loudly as possible. Eventually, people that liked it get scared that their opinion is "wrong" because the vocal minority, well, becomes vocal, and eventually stop posting their opinion. You can see that with almost any popular series, whether it was SAO, AoT, FSN, etc. Hell, even less popular ones face this.
>> ARTICLE
People consider attack on titan bad? What the fuck?

Go try and say AoT was pretty good a few days from now.

It does get fairly slow after the first half of the anime, but I wouldn't go so far as to say its "bad".

Yeah SAO was kind of the worst case though. First pretty much everybody loved it and then after a while everybody seemed to hate it. So slowly most people started disliking it.
I still like it though but all the negativity has kinda ruined it for me.

Highly agree. People say OPM has its moments but it slowly leaves you unsatisfied, but I very much disagree with that. I watched the whole series twice, once right after I watched the final episode. The hype moments are still hype and its the only anime I'd consider getting a blu-ray for. People are just scared I guess.

I mean, that's what I figured, I just thought it would hold out longer from all the hype surrounding it.  I'm assuming within 4-5 months it wont be top 20 even.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the same thing with Shigatsu. Figured it would drop like NGNL. 

I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
>> ARTICLE
They aren't at all comparable.  Shigatsu started the season higher than OPM and stayed there.  OPM started out lower and rose higher based on hype, as as you can already see, it will likely drop back down to a more reasonable level eventually.

Shigatsu had a much better story than OPM as well from the sounds of it.
>> ARTICLE
Uhh... Shigatsu started at an 8 and rose to it's current score as it aired and after it finished. OPM started at an 8.5 and rose to it's current score as it aired. No different.

OPM has a +9.00 score. That's not easy to achieve on MAL. At this point I'd be surprised to see it drop below that.

> Shigatsu had a much better story than OPM as well from the sounds of it.

And that's totally subjective. I myself would very much disagree with that statement. Shigatsu has a clear and complete story, but not necessarily a better one.
>> ARTICLE
one punch man had amazing fights and music, but it didn't have a story holding it together like shigatsu which is important to an anime holding its rank.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama would disagree.
>> ARTICLE
> Welp, I'm all for letting people like what they want, but IMHO even fans of SAO will agree that is preposterous.

Fan of SAO here, it kind of depends how you're ranking it.  In terms of my favourite anime that I enjoy watching, it's easily in my top 20, probably in my top 5 even.  Considering these sites are more or less popularity contests, then of course SAO is going to be top 20 in Japan.

If we're talking about the quality of a show, then SAO being top 20 might be pushing it a tad, but I could see top 100 argued depending on one's perspective.  But I could also see an argument that FMA:B being #1 on MAL is equally as absurd.  Why is FMA:B above Shirobako?  I think that's ridiculous.  Of course, not everyone is going to agree with me, such is the realm of subjectivity ;P
>> ARTICLE
Yes, if people rank it based on enjoyment I've got no problem it being in the top 25, I wouldn't agree with it, but I would find it fair. Now, it's *""""supposed to be""""* based on quality, that's why I just can't find it in me to let it have such a high position, it's just that...I mean... even if you're a fan you've got to agree, there are at least 16 series/movies that are more well done, I know it's a subjective thing but throw me a bone here...

Now with FMA:B, yes, I also don't think it should be 1st, but it's got enough quality that I won't really find it unfair or extremely ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
> Now, it's """"supposed to be"""" based on quality

You and I both know that never has been the case nor will it ever be ;P

> even if you're a fan you've got to agree, there are at least 16 series/movies that are more well done, I know it's a subjective thing but throw me a bone here...

I already said I did!

> Now with FMA:B, yes, I also don't think it should be 1st, but it's got enough quality that I won't really find it unfair or extremely ridiculous.

I find it ridiculous.  Even in my limited anime watching experience I can already name a couple of shows better than FMA:B, I imagine someone who has seen far more than I could do better than 2.

How is School Days better than Welcome to the NHK?
>> ARTICLE
Forewarning. This is just the my off the cuff ramblings. Bullshitting because I am bored and it somewhat makes sense to me.   

**TL;DR: Wider range of viewers = wider range of tastes.**

The reason there are shows that are in drastically different slots ranking-wise could be because of how readily available anime is in Japan. 

It's their regular animated television over there unlike it is in the Western world. 

Kids as young as 1 all the way to adults old as 80 are subjected to it over there. That's a muuuch wider age range for possible anime viewers. Meaning muuuch more possibility to have different shows be more popular. Then that factors into female viewership as well. If this and other boards are any indicator, there are far more male viewers than female in the West. Think of how that would change if every girl in Japan was subject to seeing anime everytime they turned their television on. Anime is their animation. What all this means is 14-20 something males (just generalizing this figure) would be the average viewership instead of the dominate viewership. Giving a wider range of likes and dislikes. 

Lets say SOA viewers in Japan range from 5-14 (makes sense as you could think of it like TMNT and GI Joe's was for me or you as we were kids). The boys would watch it for the battles. BUT WAIT! It has a bunch of cuteness to it. So the girls who are subjected to watching tv in Japan would be watching it for it's cuteness and the romantic story. While over here in the West, the ones subjected to it would mostly be the 14-20 somethings who actively seek out anime. Mostly boys. Mostly people who are well aware of quality. 

As for Studio Deen Fate/Stay Night, it could simply be attributed to the Novel. Which the main story is Sabers. In which people would want to watch her stories over Rins. Which could account for more votes. 

I also think there may be a discrepancy between what Westerners and what Easterners decide is quality and there definitely is a big discrepancy between what we all consider is normal.

I can't speak for the VN, but the anime is one series I heard a lot about before thinking of watching it.

Some shows are too high or low in a way that makes little sense, as in, don't reflect the sales or the overall popularity the series had in Japan

On the other side Yuki Yuna is on Fall 2014's top 10, which is cool.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam SEED is #2 what
>> ARTICLE
Ha HxH 2011 is so low.Kinda surprised.Also Gintama is so high. FMAB is also low. LOGH  just 2 places from top 100.
Also SAO eh not suprised.
>> ARTICLE
Wow my 2 favourite anime are tied at 22 (Natsume + Nagi no Asukara)
>> ARTICLE
Wow, no Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal, no Detroit Metal City....oh man, NO Great Teacher Onizuka!...what is up with this list :/...it seems like its only major popular titles :/
>> ARTICLE
This is based on popularity, and not how good the anime actually is according to the Japanese, right?
>> ARTICLE
It's both combined. I don't have how the math works, but these are the overall score.
>> ARTICLE
>69 Tari Tari

I'm... very okay with it.
>> ARTICLE
To those who said another sucked rank 72 
The Japanese know their shit
>> ARTICLE
So I've never watched School Days because of all the hate I see it get in this subreddit but it's ranked pretty high? I'm starting to think maybe I should give it a go.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't waste my time but you do you.
>> ARTICLE
Was surprised Yosuga no Sora was ranked.
>> ARTICLE
>22 	Natsumes Book of Friends 1st season  
  
Noice.
>> ARTICLE
TIL my taste in anime greatly differs from the average Japanese.  
>> ARTICLE
Clannad: After Story is 7th in both tops ( this one and on MAL )

Isn't it funny ?
>> ARTICLE
Bleach, rank 366, has 366 episodes....that's actually really cool.
>> ARTICLE
Wow thats pretty interesting, Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day
being rank 8 alongside Clannad: After story. I was expecting them to be lower ranking!
>> ARTICLE
Here is a reminder Most Japanese don't use rating sites like the west and this site is not reliable, it also use the reaction from twitter and other sites to determine popularity so this not "what is the best" ranking you can go to site and see how people rated the Story/Visual/VA/Music/Character but still no reliable.

Sales are better way to determine Japanese taste also TV Rating if they are available. 

Edit: thinking about this have the opposite problem of MAL that Sequal gets rated higher here it gets rated lower lol.
>> ARTICLE
Something tells me Japan likes first seasons more no matter what. 
>> ARTICLE
This is so weird. But, considering that Gintama takes up about 5 spots of our top 10, this ranking also seems fine.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Haruhi and GITS at the top.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a little surprised SEED is the highest rated Gundam according to this list
>> ARTICLE
The highest rated gintama is only 32? As far as I've watched it's basically meant to watch for Japanese people, cosidering the amount of Japanese culture references, and MAL has 5 or more of them in the top 10? Weird.
>> ARTICLE
OMG Kaleido Star is ranked 74! Good taste Japan.

This will be the very first anime that I will introduce to my boy.
>> ARTICLE
Still not convinced Lelouch used his Geass to raise the level of R2 and convince Japan to eat Pizza Hutt
>> ARTICLE
HxH 1999 is rated higher than 2011...wtf Japan. 
>> ARTICLE
So glad baka and test is ranked high, it's hilarious. 
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko No Basket 220 [](#volibearQ)

I actually thought Haikyuu!! would be in the top 100

tfw school days is rated higher than little busters, OPM, and JoJo

>S;G

>GitS

>Bake

>Disappearance 

>Ano Hana

>Chiyahafuru

>Cowboy Bebop

>Toradora

I'm pleased.
>> ARTICLE
i'm kinda shocked on how high rated School Days is in Japan...

>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised Tari Tari is in top 100. Didn't think it was that popular of an anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see that they love the raildex series by having 3 of the in the Top 100 but where is Railgun S ?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what to say about this list but honestly, from either an objective perspective or a subjective one I can't agree almost at all with this order. And I'm pretty sure when it comes to te sale numbers they don't match this data either. It's just weird :/

SAC is third? Good taste.

Hyouka so high but no second season :/
>> ARTICLE
OreImo Second season in top 100... 

*Shudders*
>> ARTICLE
These rankings.. Damn. SAO #16, Angel Beats! #17. And even though i love K-on... Having it above animes like ToraDora, Attack On Titan, And FMA: (Brotherhood), seems a bit absurd.
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts:
Happy that *Cowboy Bebop*, *Evangelion* and *Madoka Magica* are so high, but I'm actually surprised they're not higher.
As stated already, why is *Spirited Away* so low?!
And why the heck is *Sword Art Online* so high? Am I the only who hated that show?
>> ARTICLE
It says AKIRA was released in 1998. Shouldn't it say 1988?
>> ARTICLE
Surprising to see Eureka Seven that high. Almost never mentioned here.
>> ARTICLE
God damn SAO ranked at 16? wtf japan you taking crazy pills?
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru at 9? IS THERE HOPE FOR SEASON 3?
>> ARTICLE
> 5	Bakemonogatari

> 28	Nisemonogatari

> 78	 Monogatari Second Season

> 76	Katanagatari

> 99	Nekomonogatari

You're goddamn right, my man Nisio up here just killing it on the top 100. 

[All will kneel before the best girl](http://i.imgur.com/QcyH52y.gif)

Fuck yeah.

Nisemonogatari over second season, this ends it.

Hyouka #18 babyyyyyy
>> ARTICLE
Now I understand why there are so much dirt anime.
>> ARTICLE
This is the choice of Steins;Gate!
>> ARTICLE
Wtf japan. 

We have better taste... r-right guys?
>> ARTICLE
At least Evangelion is kinda high up on the list unlike MAL's list. Also sword art ahead of Gurren Lagann makes me kinda butt hurt
>> ARTICLE
There's no way in hell Hunter x Hunter (2011) could be reasonably considered #600, do people really ignore it because "hurr hurr old version is better"? or maybe Hiatus x Hiatus ? 

However, it's refreshing to see some Ghibli titles not this recognized in the west like Castle in the Sky or Nausicaa in the top.
>> ARTICLE
Based on the scores it seems they use a 10 point scale instead of ratting everything at least a 7.
>> ARTICLE
the rating system is 1.0 - 5.0 across 5 categories: story, visuals, voice acting, music, characters. and the full rating is the average of these 5 scores

but the scores listed here aren't user ratings. they are combined scores calculated from both ratings and popularity
>> ARTICLE
At least Gintama is in the top 50.


>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter is 600 WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK. Why would they think the 1999 version is better in any way? 
>> ARTICLE
[Give this a quick read, maybe it'll change your opinion.](https://twolongfourtwitlonger.wordpress.com/2014/12/21/hxh-99-hxh-2011-btw/)
>> ARTICLE
Well their top 100 is slightly better than MAL.  But they still overrate horseshit like Naruto really badly.
>> ARTICLE
This must be a joke, these rankings are shit. Everybody complain about MAL rankings, but they are godlike compare to those one.

This just in: people have different taste, more at 11 Bob!

The Laughing Man and Individual Eleven are compilations of the first 2 gigs respectively, pulling from the episodes' overarching stories rather than the spaced out version the series relays. 

Additionally, there's another SAC movie/OVA. Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex: Solid State Society which is a direct followup to either the first or second gig  (I forget which one)
>> ARTICLE
SSS comes after 2nd GiG. 
>> ARTICLE
Info added.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I figured when I saw op put 2006 on the post. I honestly only watched a small chunk of 2nd Gig because I've been waiting to collect the DVDs so I can watch it right. I have a beautiful steel book SSS release so no wonder its timeline slightly confused me.
>> ARTICLE
I quoted your explanation on the Laughing Man and Individual Eleven. 

I added Solid State Soceity. I did browse it on Wikipedia before but totally forgot to add it :o. 

Thanks for the corrections, now the list is actually usable :3.

>> ARTICLE
You could just look on the watch order wiki here, it is correct. 

As for Arise, Border 5 is the last two episodes of Arise AA (Episode 9 & 10) and need to be watched before the new movie. Skip the rest of AA and watch the OVAs instead since AA retells them out of order. 

Once again,  the /r/anime watch order wiki has all of this information.

Edit: Looking over it again, your third and fourth points are the same about Arise. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for that edit, how did I not notice that error? Corrected :3.
>> ARTICLE
Since it seems you didn't edit the Arise section I'll make it a little clearer,  Border 5 = Episode 9 and 10 of Arise AA and is the bridge for the movie. Ignore the rest of AA. 
>> ARTICLE
Got it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you referenced the novels from SAC. They're excellent and in my opinion add a lot of world building especially in developing how characters think and operate with cyberbrains.
>> ARTICLE
You are a great person. 
>> ARTICLE
Although that's kind of overdoing it, thanks xP.

I was just surprised Wikipedia didn't have a more clear list. Whenever I looked up other lists, they still confused me. So I made my own. But then I thought, hey, other people might have the same issue, why not share it? It's incomplete now though, because the standalone complex manga's are missing. Plus I don't have a simple description for what each series is yet.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure the Arise manga has concluded. It's listed as over on Wiki too. I'm assuming there were plans for more, but there hasn't been a chapter in over two years now. For the curious, the Arise manga isn't exactly a stand out for the GitS franchise, but the art is quite nice at least. 
>> ARTICLE
Huh, on the right side here it says it's still ongoing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Arise

Maybe they forgot to update it.
>> ARTICLE
So should I skip the original and watch 2.0 instead?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
The 1995 film features a subtle green tinge to the most of it's artwork. 2.0 swaps that out for an overpowering red filter that outright dominates the shots in the film. It isn't explicitly worse, but it could have been a lot less 
"in your face."

2.0 also replaces portions of the handdrawn art and animation sequences with CGI "improvements." Immediately sticking out is the iconic first scene of Kusanagi leaping from the rooftop in order to take out her target, where the entire sequence (including Motoko) is replaced with CGI.

While the red-vs-green thing isn't a big issue for most people (I kind of prefer the red for the some shots), the CGI is unambiguously a downgrade from the beautiful traditional animation of the theatrical version.

The original is almost universally regarded as superior.
>> ARTICLE
Heh, I didn't expect them to actually be able to downgrade the visuals...Guess the original is the better choice then.
>> ARTICLE
The voice of the main antagonist (?) at the end was changed from male to female though; while this would make sense *anatomically*, all the talking is done without the host body's anatomy...
>> ARTICLE
If you can stand 3D animation watch 2.0, if you can't the original. The original is beautifully hand drawn, I only watched the first 2 minutes of 2.0 and I couldn't stand it so I just watched the original.
>> ARTICLE
Watch the original. 2.0 adds a lot of CG that really doesn't need to exist, and the 1995 version looks great even today.
>> ARTICLE
i... i... thank you for this. i am exactly the person you made this for (well, it's for yourself but you shared it for people like me so). 

i want to get into this show but i don't even know where to *begin*! upvoted and saved for sure!

> Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface [1991 - 1997] (The sequel with too many panty shots, apparently)

I already know which one I will like the most! (   )
>> ARTICLE
Will like to know your opinion after you actually read them.
>> ARTICLE
Any sequel that adds more pantyshots is an improvement to the original work, you know?
>> ARTICLE
Not in this case though.
>> ARTICLE
I was joking anyways. In actuality I hate fanservice (Including non sexual fanservice).
>> ARTICLE
Fanservice was one of the problems MMI has.

Stand alone complex takes it's internet interface from MMI though.
>> ARTICLE
Man, the novels were excellent but my friend lost my copy of White Maze. Go figure it's the only one that is expensive now...
>> ARTICLE
It's a conspiracy, they caused everyone to lose it and that's why it's so expensive now. 

>> ARTICLE
You *could* check of some of Shirow Masamune's other stuff, both anime and manga. There's [Appleseed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appleseed_%28manga%29) -- which most people recommend the manga for, rather than the anime adaptions, which tend to be all over the place --, Dominion Tank Police, and the Black Magic M-66 OVA. 
>> ARTICLE
I had to google his name lol. Appleseed looks really neat I'm going to go find it now :D
>> ARTICLE
The Appleseed universe is set up in multiple different continuities. These are the separate ones:

- The manga

- The 1988 OVA

- The 2004 movie --> continues with the 2007 movie "Ex Machina"

- The 2013 ONA series "Appleseed XIII"

- The 2014 movie "Appleseed Alpha"

I highly recommend [Appleseed Alpha](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=16163). It's my favorite of the movies.

Probably gunna skip the manga, hurts my eyes to read it on the laptop :(

More cyberpunk:

* Texhnolyze
* Bubblegum Crisis
* Serial Experiments Lain
* Armitage III
* Akira
* Ergo Proxy

> Ergo Proxy

I think I've seen this one! Many moons ago. Ending didn't make sense. :(
>> ARTICLE
> Ending didn't make sense. :(

it did. Rewatch!
>> ARTICLE
You could always rewatch it! There's a lot of good explanations out there about the ending you can read up on once you're refreshed on it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll give it another go!

There was another anime years ago that had this half-done wtf ending and all I remember was two guys named Cain and Abel fighting in the end and overall left me very unsatisfied. I hope that wasn't the ending to Ergo Proxy lol. Either way, that whole month was just a blah month for anything I watched.
>> ARTICLE
That sounds like Trinity Blood.  Man that show was a train wreck.
>> ARTICLE
That was it!!

Ending made no sense. Storyline felt good then went nowhere. I fell asleep several times during it.
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture, watch Episode 9 & 10 that is Border 5, and is the bridge to the movie that comes out on BD w/ English subs on October 28th.

Commie has Ep9 & 10 subbed.

If you want sort-of cyberpunk warfare with mechas try out Mobile Police Patlabor: The Early Days -> Movie I -> Movie II (Skip WXIII).
>> ARTICLE
OH! I forgot I did watch that one. Didn't really seem to fit though? Felt out of place or something.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I think it'll connect more with the movie with the wrapup, it just took the next step of the [Arise](/s "Firestarter virus/Pyrophoric arc") pretty much.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I hope so. I liked Arise a lot. Not as good as the original, plot felt a bit scattered at times, but felt so good to watch the GitS universe again.
>> ARTICLE
Akira! A great cyberpunk movie that, along with GitS, defined the genre
>> ARTICLE
Second the shit out of Akira! Thats one epic cyber punk classic.
>> ARTICLE
Lol i just finished Texhnolyze and was about to start Ghost in the Shell SAC. I already watched both movies, and Ill probably check out arise (any good?).

From what I hear Texhnolyze has similarities as does Ergo Proxy. I can recommend Texhnolyze as an anime i really loved. But warning it is slow paced and very "show don't tell". The first ep is flat out arthouse with very little dialogue, but after that it is more coherent. Being patient with it is worth it if you like complex psychological and philosophical musings. 

Edit: I also second anyone who says Serial Experiments Lain, i love that show too. It is much more abtract, but its only like 12 eps, and very well done. It isn't tech but Haibane Renmei is also a gem and it has the same character designs as Lain and Tex, and has some similarities in its psych and philo musings. 

Another series that has similarities to what you describe is a mech series Patlabor, the original OVA and movies. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen anyone suggest Gunnm yet, also known as Battle Angel Alita, so I'll go ahead and suggest you check that franchise out
>> ARTICLE
Baccano!
>> ARTICLE
god i love that one!
>> ARTICLE
After reading a quick summary on wikipedia of it, that series sounds awesome! Looks like I know what to get next. :)
>> ARTICLE
Cheers, I got my dvd set of it today :)

For $1/episode, not a bad deal: http://www.rightstuf.com/cgi-bin/catalogmgr/ZsK5Y9RWC1jPHfzgrv/browse/item/89572/4/0/0

Be sure to check out Durarara! too. Done by the same writer.

Will do! Thanks!

[The Twelve Kingdoms](http://myanimelist.net/anime/153/Juuni_Kokuki) - If you're both into epic fantasy adventure anime, don't hesitate to try The Twelve Kingdoms. I hate to say this because I advocate "one episode to know if it's for you" but The Twelve Kingdoms is worth it. Once you watch passed episode 5, it gets much better. The story picks up, main character starts changing for the better, and more characters start to be introduced. The Twelve Kingdoms is all about character development and telling an amazing story which interlocks with each other.

[Code Geass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) - If you haven't seen this yet, give it a try. Code Geass is very addicting and so much fun to watch.

[Katanagatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6594/Katanagatari)

[Darker Than Black](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2025/Darker_than_Black:_Kuro_no_Keiyakusha)

[Break Blade](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6772/Break_Blade_1:_Kakusei_no_Toki)

[Claymore](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1818/Claymore)

[Ga-Rei: Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4725/Ga-Rei:_Zero)

[Sword of the Stranger](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2418/Sword_of_the_Stranger) - Great movie for when you don't feel like watching a series.

[Eden of the East](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5630/Higashi_no_Eden) - Very addicting anime that I loved but the ending could have been better.

[Honey and Clover](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16/Honey_and_Clover) - Hilarious love story that becomes much more melodramatic and bittersweet in the second half.

[Nodame Cantabile](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1698/Nodame_Cantabile) - If you're looking for a beautiful romantic comedy, this is it. Nodame Cantabile is one of my favorite romance series ever.

[Arakawa Under the Bridge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7647/Arakawa_Under_the_Bridge) - If you're looking for ridiculous situations and characters that will make you laugh till you're near death, this series won't let you down. Of course, comedy is subjective so you'll know whether Arakawa is for you within the first 10 minutes.

[Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou) - Nichijou is a very gag heavy anime and is relatively fast paced. I absolutely loved Nichijou but it's definitely not for everyone.

[Shinryaku! Ika Musume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8557/Shinryaku!_Ika_Musume) - Are you looking for a cute comedy? If your answer is yes, you'll probably love this.

[Mayo Chiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10110/Mayo_Chiki!) - One of the better romantic comedies to come out recently.

[Nyan Koi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6512/Nyan_Koi!) - Same as above.

I hope you find anime you and your gf enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
I was a big fan of Eden of the East when I watched it, and so what she when I introduced her to it later (forgot to mention that one in the OP). I haven't watched Claymore, but she watched every episode and loved it to death.

Code Geass seems to be highly praised on this subreddit. Time for a watch!

Arakawa Under the Bridge sounds hilarious. Will definitely give that a try.

Now, if only I could find a series that made me *think* as much as Evangelion or Lain did... something deep and symbolic, with ambiguous undertones that can be interpreted so many ways. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Lain or Evangelion(I've only seen end of evangelion) so I can't give you recommendations based around those. I did try to give you darker series in the first half of the list. I've also included below two more recommendations I should have mentioned.

[Berserk](http://myanimelist.net/anime/33/Berserk) - I know you wanted newer anime but if you haven't seen Berserk, I suggest you give it a try.

[Legend of the Legendary Heroes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8086/Densetsu_no_Yuusha_no_Densetsu) - This is a fun and easily enjoyable series that tries to tell a big and epic story. While it does have its hiccups it does do a relatively good job.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man... Do yourself a favor and watch both of those series, especially Eva. Please. 

You'll appreciate the End of Evangelion so much more if you do. 
>> ARTICLE
You've seen End of Eva, but not NGE?  How much of a mindscrew was that?
>> ARTICLE
Yea, I didn't know what the heck was going on. I didn't know Evangelion was a series at the time. I had just gotten into anime and someone recommended I watch Evangelion. End of Eva was all I could find and I thought that was what they wanted me to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Steins;Gate with my roommate, who is opposite sex. She enjoyed it 

Bakemonogatari, lots of dialogue, but I enjoyed it myself


should watch Mirai Nikki with the gf >:D

Oh, and Another next week.
>> ARTICLE
> should watch Mirai Nikki with the gf >:D

I honestly don't think it's safe for you...

If you're looking for a romantic/drama series to watch with your girlfriend:

* Clannad & Clannad: After Story <- This one is a MUST
* Toradora!
* Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (AnoHana)
* ef: A Tale of Memories

Or just a series that's just good overall:

* Gintama
* Angel Beats
* Death Note
* Steins;Gate
>> ARTICLE
Ok seeing what you seen and liked:  
**Kara no Kyoukai** movies (7 in total, just too awesome music and art)  
**Spice and Wolf** Kinda slow but if you enjoed Kino no Tabi this one should hit the spot  
**Bakemonogatari** My reaction was : *Omg what the fu*k was that? Let's watch it again to make sure*  
**Puella Magi Madoka Magica** Forgetting this, if i say anything about, it won't be as much as effective...just watch till ep 3, if you don't like it you can drop it...  
  
Edit for add Madoka  
PS: FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T WATCH MADOKA DUBBED, FOR NO REASON IN THE WORLD YOU SHOULD DO THAT, IT'S SO TERRIBLE THAT COULD JUST MAKE YOUR SCREEN IMPLODE

>> ARTICLE
The dub is that bad, huh?

And here I thought Sailor Moon's dub was bad...
>> ARTICLE
It's not *that* bad, people are blowing it out of proportion. It's still not great, however, and would recommend not watching it dubbed (when it's released).

If you liked Lain and Ghost in the Shell, I think you'll really enjoy Ghost Hound. It has the creator of GitS and the director of Lain and Kino's Journey. The dub is also pretty good.

There's also Haibane Renmei, which is the same creator as Lain and very thought-provoking as well.

I'd also recommend Samurai Champloo and Baccano, both of which have excellent dubs and fun action. Darker than Black and Code Geass are also pretty good.

Since you liked Evangelion, have you seen the Rebuild movies yet?

If you want some other interesting shows, these only have subs available:

* Mawaru Penguindrum (lots of symbolism)

* The Tatami Galaxy
>> ARTICLE
I will definitely check out ghost hound, if both of those people were involved in making it!
>> ARTICLE
Watched Haibane Renmei (and Niea_7) and loved it. It had a very deep undertone. 

I've seen the first Eva rebuild movie, but it'll never compare to The End of Evangelion.

Durarara!, Elfen Leid, Code Geass, Black Lagoon, Full Metal Panic, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Stein's Gate, Shakugan no Shana, To Aru Magic no Index, Fate/Zero, Fate Stay Night, Ga Rei Zero, Death Note (cliche recommendation, but great nonetheless. Stay the hell away from the live action films), Shiki, Persona 4, and...tons of others...
>> ARTICLE
Great suggestions, thanks! I tend to stick to more introverted series, but action series can catch my interest sometimes. Wasn't too much of a fan of Full Metal Panic, and I don't care for the art style of Death Note, but I'll look into some of the others.
>> ARTICLE
Try watching Durarara! its one of my favorite animes and a good mix of action with character development. If you do watch it watch the dubbed version though.
>> ARTICLE
Will do!
>> ARTICLE
>she prefers watching things in Dub

Get a new girlfriend.

All joking aside, there are some shows with pretty good dubs: Death Note (profile: not watching a series because you dislike the art is kinda dumb, especially something as good as Death Note. Book, cover, etc.), Code Grass, and The Melencholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya are all pretty good (Crispin Freeman nailed Kyon imo).

The problem with dubs is that it's sometimes hard to make certain things not sound ridiculous (every single translation of itadakimasu sounds awkward when spoken...not that they should leave it, that would be dumb). Try easing her into shows with stellar Japanese casts, like Madoka Magica or Chaos;Head. She may get used to it.
>> ARTICLE
Always been a Crispin Freeman fan. I loved the Slayers dubs. 

Don't know much about Madoka... Is it a magical girl series? Might be hard to get the gf into that. I'm the big Sailor Moon fan, not her.

Code Geass, not grass. Stupid autocorrect.

Looks like I'll have to check it out, then. :) Thanks man!

Black Butler. light enough to enjoy without getting too into it, yet still enjoyable enough to watch every episode
>> ARTICLE
Well if you liked Cowboy Bebop and want something dubbed, the Samurai Champloo dub is pretty fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the one episode I saw. I'll look into getting the rest of it now that you say this. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, you've already seen MI, that's normally my three-point suggestion! So, I guess I'll go with another couple of less-seen ones, both romantic comedies, but just a little different;

Kuragehime (Princess Jellyfish)- I think it's safe to say that the 2 main characters in this one are about as far from the normal romatic leads as any I've ever seen!

Lovely Complex- radically different art, and apparently everybody is speaking a completely different dialect from the rest of anime-dom!

Oh, and they're both fun and funny shows too!
>> ARTICLE
I've always felt that Rumiko Takahashi is a master of romantic comedy. I own all of the Maison Ikkoku manga, and it's my favorite manga series to date. 

Loved all of Ranma 1/2, too. 

I'll look Into the series you suggested!
>> ARTICLE
I've just finished watching the first 2-3 episodes of both these shows, and had to come back to reaffirm the greatness of them both! Laughed till I wheezed!

If you're looking for dubs, FUNimation has the best I've seen.

Series I'd recommend:

Black Butler/Kuroshitsuji, it's pretty good for some laughs. Interesting.

Durarara!! is my new-recent favorite, although second arc it does get pretty serious. I love it though.

Code Geass also has a pretty good dub [but if you've watched Bleach, you can never not-recognize the voices. It's not bad, it's kind of fun actually, but yeah.].

D.Gray-man also is in my favorites, but dear Lord do not watch dubbed. At least not after watching subbed, the transition murders your ears.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a very, very good anime with a spectacular dub cast of VA's.

Lastly, if you're looking for mostly laugh with some seriousness, Ouran High School Host Club. That also has a very nice dub [especially compared to some I've heard...] and is a total parody of normal shoujo manga/anime, but it's legitimately funny. It also has its surprisingly serious points, but it's really, really good.

Have fun :]

Thanks for all of the suggestions. I'll check out all of them, especially Durarara, based off of all the other people hyping it in here. :)

Huh, never heard of it before now. It sounds like Hulu dedicated to anime. Do they host fansubs? Or is it simply dubs/raws?

please don't use cr

?
>> ARTICLE
Trolls will be trolls. Support the industry, you won't regret it. CR's subs are just as good as most if not all of the fansub groups.
>> ARTICLE
Ah... Makes more sense now. 
>> ARTICLE
Some people seem to think that CR kicked fansubs in the balls because they went legit and are ruining fansubbing with their awful translations or something.

What they forget to mention is that CR's translation team includes a fuckton of former fansubbers.

They're fine, really. Haters just don't wanna pay, or wait a week for free subs.

Edit: silly Android, fansubs is a word.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks so much for clearing this up. Been out of the scene for a while. :)

They sub the series themselves.

For dubs, you may want to look at Netflix's selection. Baccano! and Gurren Lagann are decently dubbed shows you can start with.

I am personally happy with this, fantastic series, would have it #1 on mine if it was an anime/on MAL.

It is mildly amusing to me that A:tLA is  (anime in Japanese), but not an anime (in English).

Because we Americans are picky as Fuck. RWBY is even considered an anime in Japan because they don't give a shit about cartoon vs anime wars over there. If it's animated then it's anime by default

Yes, but anime is the japanese word we use to describe japanese animation only. Its not about cartoon vs anime, its about making clear what is what.

Holy cow Gate

That looks like a grand case of hype-train and airing bias.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Also Haikyuu at 9th, OPM at 3rd, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu at 73, Death Parade at 79, Naruto at 89 and One Piece at 59.

Definitely strong bias towards shows that are currently airing. 
>> ARTICLE
One piece..  Strong bias? Bruh if it finished airing it'd be rated a lot higher
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. I'm not sure about that. The story is great but the pacing for the anime is horseshit.

I love the story. However I can't give a shit about the story if it takes 50 episodes to complete an arc.

At this rate Oda might die before we see the ending of the story.
>> ARTICLE
It's not what you think though, just how it'd be rated. Fk the pacing agreed
>> ARTICLE
lmao Haikyuu is pretty damn good, it's pretty high up even on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
OPM is good as well. Doesn't mean they're not overrated by recency bias.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's cool how Avatar, RWBY, and similar shows are allowed. This and allowing for scores of X/100 are all the only things I've liked about Hummingbird so far.
>> ARTICLE
You must be thinking about another site, I don't think Hummingbird has x/100

Not sure if I'm more happy with Bebop in the top 10 or salty AF that OPM is above Hunter x Hunter...so conflicted.

The following were anime on the myanimelist top 100 that were not on the hummingbird top 100:

Katkyo Hitman Reborn! (rank 100 on MAL)

Honey and Clover (rank 99 on MAL)

Detective Conan (rank 98 on MAL)

Ashita no Joe (rank 97 on MAL)

One Outs (rank 96 on MAL)

Kyoukai no Kanata (rank 94 on MAL)

The Tale of Princess Kaguya (rank 93 on MAL)

Rose of Versailles (rank 92 on MAL)

Beck (rank 90 on MAL)

Sakurasou (rank 89 on MAL)

Ouran High School Host Club (rank 88 on MAL)

Higurashi (rank 84 on MAL)

Angel Beats (rank 83 on MAL)

Tsubasa (rank 82 on MAL)

Kemono no Souja Erin (rank 77 on MAL)

Shirobako (rank 73 on MAL)

Romeo no Aoi Sora (rank 68 on MAL)

Mononoke (rank 64 on MAL)

Slam Dunk (rank 55 on MAL)

Nana (rank 50 on MAL)

Kingdom (rank 46 on MAL)

Rainbow (rank 34 on MAL)

Personally, I agree more with the MAL top 100.

How many have you seen out of the hummingbird list?

I have 50/100. Exactly half.

68 seen or attempted, compared to 53 from the corresponding condensed MAL Top 100. Maybe I should switch over.

Next we'll get to see an adjusted score combining the MAL and Hummingbird to see where a lot of shows even out.

>> ARTICLE
I liked magi... :(
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing wrong with liking it, but it's a bad show on almost every level. It was like a poor man's Avatar or FMA.
>> ARTICLE
How was it "bad"? It was pretty, had some nice characters, a kinda unique setting and some pretty welldone action scenes. It was a bit childish sure, but I don't think it was bad...
>> ARTICLE
The pacing was really bad, for starters. All the arcs were paced poorly. The earlier episodes were just rushed, and didn't allow you to form any sort of connection to the characters. The later arcs were drawn out and dragged on to unreasonable lengths.

The characters are some of the worst I've seen. Obviously this was to cater towards a young audience, but that's no excuse for having poorly written backstories, and shocking character exposition. Alibaba is probably the character I hate the most (save Kirito). He was written to be juvenile and immature, as were most of the characters, which honestly reflects quite poorly on the writers.

The plot was not well thought out, and was unsatisfying, especially compared to the superior Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

how is Crest of the stars, by the way? i passed it overin the past, because the summary seemed weak, did I miss out?
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty solid sci-fi series.

Yeah, the summary does seem pretty generic... it paints it as sort of a coming of age story. While that's one aspect to it, there's also a pretty large emphasis on politics and war.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure what you've seen so the comparison may not be helpful, but take the relationship dynamic from Spice and Wolf and put the (somewhat younger) main characters in the military and at the center of an interstellar war.

It's slow to develop, unfinished (even the novels the show's based on aren't done), and the supporting characters can be rather dull. But it's still one of my favorite series.

'Patchy' might be fairer than 'bad'. There're quite a lot of screwups in the art and actual motion comes and goes but the storyboarding of the fights can be pretty good. And towards the end Ichiro Itano starts doing key animation and he's developing the oomph he'd bring to Ideon and Macross.

"GitS" (1995) is the original movie, using the manga's premise in a different way. "GitS 2.0" is the same as "GitS", just with 3D animations that imo look worse. "GitS - Innocense" is the second movie, not as good as the first one but watchable.

"GitS: S.A.C. 1st GIG" & "2nd GIG" are the two seasons of the anime series, once again using the setting in a different continuity. "GitS: S.A.C. - Solid State Society" is the movie that continues the story.

"GitS: S.A.C. - The Laughing Man" is "1st GIG" in OVA form. "GitS: S.A.C.  Individual Eleven" is the same for "2nd GIG". Both are not really required watching, imo.

Read the original manga compilation first.  Everything else is based on that.

After that, watch Stand Alone Complex and Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig, as both of those are basically modified re-telling / extrapolations from the manga, but with stronger narrative and updated technological references.  Then watch the GITS: SAC: Solid State Society movie.

After that, watch the first GitS movie, but try to find the non-2.0 version, as the CG additions just don't work very well.  The GitS movie is more or less an extraction from the manga, but it doesn't feel the same as the manga.

After that, you can watch Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (which is another extract from the original manga, but gets very mixed reviews and I literally fell asleep in the audience when watching the theatrical tour of it) and read the "Man Machine Interface" and "Human Error Processor" graphic novels.

Ok, so where does Individual Eleven fit into it then?

Try HS romance: Toradora!

Try Josei: Nodame Cantabile

Try Drama: Ano Hana.

Expand your genres.

I started Nodame Cantibile.  Its Great!  
>> ARTICLE
Glad to hear that. I should re-watch it some day.

More good Josei:

* Honey and Clover
* Usagi Drop (Bunny Drop)

On another note. 

* You should try Hayate no Gotoku. Extremely good comedy. You'll enjoy it even more thanks to your experience with old-school shonen classics.

* Another really good comedy is Seto no Hanayome.

I usually don't mind too many "Recommend me Anime!" posts, but at least put some commas or make it in list format. Other than that I reccomend:

* [Death Note](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note), because you liked Code Geass (They're very similar)
* [Fairy Tail](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail), because of Naruto (I haven't seen all of naruto but apparently FT is similar to the big 3) and maybe Soul Eater

* Obligatory [Redline](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6675/Redline) (Eyegasmic visuals) and [Golden Boy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/268/Golden_Boy) (make sure you watch the dub, its hilarious) suggestions.

personally rec steins;gate, its my favorite by far from what ive watched. other on my mal link.

Definitely Steins;Gate - really deep plot, and just plain awesome. I've watched it several times, and it never gets old.
You may also want to try Black Rock Shooter. I think of it as being a whole lot like FLCL in terms of the plot, but it's a little more (way more^10) serious and emotional. Beautiful animation.

Can i get you to watch One Piece??? Its my favourite manga and a great anime. Its long, earliest eps are old and it is also slow to start but man from ur choices i think ud love it too if u get a good few episodes long. I cant really make a good point but if ur interested heres my blog post on it. 

[One Piece Blog](http://mangaanimeandmovies.blogspot.com/) No need to click it, its long and now that i type it, it looks like self promotion, but i would take ages to type my whole opinion haha, but i wrote it to get people interested in different anime/manga (no spoilers)

One Piece has sooooo many episodes.. . i dont think i can handle that much ridiculousness.

Thank you it answer some of my questions. 

What about :

- Ghost in the Shell 2.0
- Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex 1st GIG - The Laughing Man
- Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG - Individual Eleven
>> ARTICLE
The wiki is missing Ghost in the Shell Arise: Alternative Architecture, which airs this spring. It's supposedly a re-cut of the Arise OVAs into TV format as well as new episodes added. You can probably skip the OVAs and just go with it instead.

There is also a new movie coming out this year (I think Summer) that IIRC was confirmed to be in the Arise continuity. It's most likely gonna be a sequel to Alternative Architecture. We don't know for sure yet, though.

2.0 is a pretty bad version of the original movie with some scenes remade in CGI.

Those two SAC movies are just summary movies of the main plots of the SAC seasons. Just watch the show. Solid State Society is a sequel, though, so do watch that.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I'll wait for the Alternative Architecture and the sequel movie. 

So I'll watch : 

- Ghost in the Shell (1995)
- Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (1&2 GIG)
- Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society
- Ghost in the Shell Arise: Alternative Architecture TV
- Ghost in the Shell Arise: Alternative Architecture Movie

Thank you !
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but watch *Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence* after the original movie. It's an actual sequel to it unlike *2.0* which is the remake.
>> ARTICLE
Noted !

> Ghost in the Shell 2.0

That's just a re-make version of the 1st movie. No need to bother with it.

I'm not sure if you need to watch them. Most important is the real storyline though.

To add to the FAQ:

* Ghost in the Shell 2.0 is a remastering of the first Ghost in the Shell movie, with more CGI.

* There hasn't really been a straight up adaption of the manga as I understand it; the manga is different from all the anime iterations.

* The Laughing Man movie is a recap of the main storyline of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.

* The Individual Eleven movie is a recap of the main storyline of the 2nd Gig series.

/u/urban287 some knowledge to add to the Watch Order Page

Okay, so based on your answers I  don't need to watch those :


- Ghost in the Shell 2.0 (remake of the original movie)
- Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex 1st GIG - The Laughing Man (recap of the S.A.C serie)
- Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG - Individual Eleven (recap of the S.A.C serie)

Thank you it makes much more sense now :D

Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.

They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.

Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for

KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.

5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.

> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

I see the merit in separating them, they're kind of hard to equate with series. But MAL doesn't separate 'em and you actually end up with a nice variety of both when you condense it like this so I thought it made sense!

They're not cannon but they still count as much as the Steins;Gate movie counts :/ unfortunately

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Reborn! at 86 is a nice surprise. I think Naruto part 1 deserves to be in this list but it makes sense that it isn't, considering the hate it gets on mal. The top review there complains about its popularity in its first paragraph.

From my quick scan it seems like I only got 30/100.

I don't believe the scores I gave them were that great anyways so I don't feel too bad about missing out on the rest of the top 100.

Well actually they come out to 5.3 which is slightly above my average. Guess they did a lot better than I expected.

I would really like to revisit this chart once Season 2 of Shokugeki no Soma is animated by JC Staff. Autumn Election final 8 is, IMO, the strongest arc of the manga.

Yay for Slam Dunk making in to the top 100. Very first sports anime that I watched and enjoyed. I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, I dodnt even realize that lol

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Angels Beats is always rated high for some reason :/. I liked it, but there are many others that are definitely better.

Seriously? I don't want to say it's overrated especially after seeing the thread earlier about calling something overrated but come on. If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people. Maybe I just don't see it but can someone please tell me what is so good about this show cause I rated it a 7(and I think this may be overdoing it)and that is mainly due to the animation. The jokes can only be funny for so long and I didn't even find them that funny in the first place.

OPM is a really good show. But no way it should ever be above Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.

I don't understand why people like game of thrones but i'm not just going to complain about its imdb rank am i?

So this is clearly going over your head. I said I want to hear what other people are saying as to why it's so good. Do you not want to hear people's reasoning for their differing opinions?
>> ARTICLE
Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol
>> ARTICLE
It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.

Lol, u prob wanted to stay off of /r/anime during the entire fall season then.

the guy probably wanted you to get the same enjoyment he experienced, I dont think he meant any harm. 

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.
>> ARTICLE
I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.
>> ARTICLE
recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.
>> ARTICLE
True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.
>> ARTICLE
Why do we need this thread posted every week?
>> ARTICLE
I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.
>> ARTICLE
The movie series came first:

1. Ghost in the Shell
2. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence

SAC came later as a separate adaptation of the manga:

1. Stand Alone Complex
2. SAC: 2nd Gig
3. Solid State Society

Both are interpretations rather than straight copies of the manga, so you'll want to get that if you want the original/canonical story, but both are famous on their own merits too.

You can safely ignore:

* Ghost in the Shell 2.0, as a latecoming recut of the first movie
* The Laughing Man, as an abridgement of SAC 1st Gig
* Individual 11, as an abridgement of SAC 2nd Gig.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Ghost In The Shell 2.0 was better than the original. The sound quality was much improved, at any rate.
>> ARTICLE
GitS: original movie.

GitS 2 Innocence: second movie.

GitS 2.0: remake of the original movie.

GitS SAC: First season of the TV anime.

GitS SAC 2nd Gig: Second season of the TV anime.

GitS SSS: OVA series which is sort of a third season of the TV anime.

GitS The laughing man: A movie remake of the first season.

GitS Individual 11: A movie remake of the second season.

SAC, 2nd Gig and SSS should definitely be watched in that order. GitS 2.0 is a must-watch, either before or after the TV series is your call, I'd watch it after. The laughing man and Individual 11 are very optional and I wouldn't bother as they're pretty similar to the TV series, mostly just milking the franchise. I haven't seen the original 2 movies so I'm not sure how different they are to the TV series but I'd watch them after if you want to see them.

In short, SAC, 2nd Gig, SSS, 2.0.

Also if you're the type to buy figures and you like GitS [check](http://www.amiami.jp/shop/?set=english&vgForm=ProductInfo&sku=HOB-FIG-5638&template=default/product/e_display.html) [these](http://www.amiami.jp/shop/?set=english&vgForm=ProductInfo&sku=HOB-FIG-6140&template=default/product/e_display.html) [out](http://www.amiami.jp/shop/?set=english&vgForm=ProductInfo&sku=HOB-FIG-6141&template=default/product/e_display.html) (3 links).

Also for SAC watch past the credits as there are shorts with the Tachikoma.
>> ARTICLE
From what I remember, "Ghost in the Shell" and "Innocence" are in their own universe, separate from SAC's canon.

So for GitS movies, it goes "Ghost in the Shell," then "Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence." Much of the plot carries over from the first to the second one.

I haven't seen much of SAC, so maybe somebody can help you out there?

1. Mate look at how much anime-related subreddits are there already.
2. Posting even only half of them would  cramp the sidebar.
3. And why is it poorly designed anyway? Nearly every sidebars of big subreddits like this subreddit in reddit are designed this way (hyperlink to related subreddits of a certain subreddit 'cause there are way too many of them to be listed at the sidebar most of the time).
4. Also if you want to complain then don't do it to us; it's the mods' job to take complains. Though I think they have better things to do than listening to minor things like this (probably). 
5. Be less lazy and more active and read the rules/ related subreddits list thoroughly. Though I'm not against of you posting this, hundreds of thousands of /r/anime dwellers **ARE**.

Really? I didn't bother to look if this was posted anywhere as I wrote it entirely myself.

I posted this for a friend on Facebook and decided to share the knowledge here. 

The watch order is a huge document and I didn't even know about it until you mentioned it.

I actually disagree with some of the things in there on unrelated anime, but that's personal opinion based on production information and screenplay writers vs "original idea creators." selling usage rights to a novel idea can lead to some huge plot changes to light novels and manga that deviate from the creator's ideas for better or worse.

Some good shows on your list. I am a big fan of the Slayers series and the .Hack series as well. 

Also, I agree with the other comments in that using a anime list tracker like MAL is good to keep track of what you watch and want to watch, especially when you get past that first 100 or so count. I didn't set mine up until after I had watched 300-400+ anime titles (movies and series), but it has been a great way to remind me what I have seen and what I plan to watch.
