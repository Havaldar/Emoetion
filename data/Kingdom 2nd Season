Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)
>> ARTICLE
How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.
>> ARTICLE
Well deserved.

Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites. 

Miyamori is love, Miyamori is life.

I'd love to see this updated after every season. Maybe this can be a sidebar addition or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

Surprised I've never heard of rainbow considering its so high up this list.

In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

Holy shit.

I feel like I need to watch this.

You should, it's pretty great.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

[](#yousaidsomethingdumb)

IIRC it was at 8.70~ after it ended. It dropped only by a little bit.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

Yep, sounds like you understand!

They're not cannon but they still count as much as the Steins;Gate movie counts :/ unfortunately

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Yay for Slam Dunk making in to the top 100. Very first sports anime that I watched and enjoyed. I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Oh wow, I dodnt even realize that lol

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Maybe I just don't see it but can someone please tell me what is so good about this show cause I rated it a 7(and I think this may be overdoing it)and that is mainly due to the animation. The jokes can only be funny for so long and I didn't even find them that funny in the first place.
>One Punch Man | 9.02 | 12 Eps | 2015
>> ARTICLE
OPM is a really good show. But no way it should ever be above Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why people like game of thrones but i'm not just going to complain about its imdb rank am i?
>> ARTICLE
So this is clearly going over your head. I said I want to hear what other people are saying as to why it's so good. Do you not want to hear people's reasoning for their differing opinions?
>> ARTICLE
Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol
>> ARTICLE
It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, u prob wanted to stay off of /r/anime during the entire fall season then.
>> ARTICLE
the guy probably wanted you to get the same enjoyment he experienced, I dont think he meant any harm. 

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.
>> ARTICLE
I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.
>> ARTICLE
recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.
>> ARTICLE
True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.
>> ARTICLE
Why do we need this thread posted every week?
>> ARTICLE
I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.

I love how Gintama manages to make this list too.
>> ARTICLE
Not really surprising.  This is just for Gintama': Enchousen (2012).  Gintama (2006) Is rated 46 or something in popularity.  When people add shows to their MAL, they don't always take into consideration that additional seasons in MAL often get added as separate entries.
>> ARTICLE
Really it's just because a lot of people who have watched a ton of Gintama still might not have made it that far. (I haven't yet)

Gintama makes every list.

Really hard to understand why Hajime No Ippo is so unpopular.

Ashita no Joe is enough boxing for me. I really don't need more than one anime in my life for any given sport.

I would think not a lot of anime watchers are into something like boxing. When you count over 100 episodes with all the series combined that adds to it also. Hajime no Ippo definitely one of my favorite series of all time though.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's sort of the reason but I don't even like boxing and Hajime No Ippo is in my top 3 easily.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I find myself watching a lot of sports anime when the only ones I follow are Cricket and to a lesser extent Football(Soccer)
>> ARTICLE
Definitely on my top list, but I feel a sort of dissonance when I tried watching an actual boxing match, it just didn't feel the same. The author and artist did something to Ippo to make the series spectacular.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because the manga and anime has to make every match insanely good, as intense as a boxing match can be, it's a battle shonen series afterall. Obviously only one in a thousand real pro matches can get close to it. Same with any sport.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Nodame Cantabile on this list. Just started season 1 and its so much fun.

I guarantee it gets 10000000000x better when you hear the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonic versions of all the mentioned songs

One day, [Sora No Woto](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To) will be on a list like this.  
[Until then...](http://i.imgur.com/bFYqoLb.gif)
>> ARTICLE
It might be too late for our trumpet girl as the anime's been out for quite a long time.
>> ARTICLE
Most likely never going to reach a decent scoring unless MAL somehow resets them (even so, it probably won't affect much of anything).

But for those wondering, Sora no Woto is a spectacular SoL series located in a very interesting post-apocalyptic setting. The show definitely has a very cute cast of characters, but it's not afraid to venture into a more heavy scene as the show progresses. Accompanied by the musical talents of Kalafina & Yuki Kajiura, the show has one of the best OSTs from a SoL. 

It is not at all a K-On clone like many have assumed it to be. The only drawback this show has is the fact that the world it takes place in is left devastatingly unexplored. I would've loved to learn more about the world this anime takes place in.

Give it a chance.

EDIT: A phrase.
>> ARTICLE
Nitpick: Sora no Woto's OST is by the unparalleled Ooshima Michiru (Xam'd, Tatami Galaxy, Zetsuen no Tempest). While I will disagree with you on the worth of the show as a whole, the soundtrack is a work of art. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems I've screwed up a little bit.

Perfectly fine if you don't hold it up as close to the candle as I do. Even if people don't agree with how great of a show it is, it's still a fine military SoL.
>> ARTICLE
Sold, added it to my plan to watch queue. Even though that means I still will probably never get to it but it's closer.

Also the statement about resetting the scores seems odd. Is there some reason that resetting the rates would bring the score up? Like was there a bunch of hatred for this show at one point and was given crap ratings. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not too sold on the idea that resetting the scores would bring up the score by much either (despite mentioning it). That's just the only solution I could see possibly working that would raise it's current rating. Sort of just threw the idea out there since the chances of MAL getting a score reset is unlikely

Then again, I'm not sure what the reason was for the initial dislike the show received when it had aired. I'm just assuming the general consensus now is that it isn't deserving of it's current low-ish score. And I agree with it. 

Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.
>> ARTICLE
>Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.

Pretty much this. haha. I don't know what could be done so that the scoring was meaningful. Just hope someone recommends and speaks out for those diamonds in the rough so you get a chance to experience them.
>> ARTICLE
Scoring will never be a useful tool for reviewing without some form of commentary to go along with it. All my scores on my MAL are only meant to be useful for myself.

Thankfully there are always a few reviews on MAL & other websites that give me a little bit more than just a score.

So mushishi, natsume book of friends, Kara no kyoukai, black butler, saint seiya, JoJo, hanamonogatari belong to "lesser known" list? What the actual fuck

To be fair it's movie 8 of Kara no Kyoukai that's on here, the lesser known 8th movie that wasn't even as good as movie 6 IMO... but yeah, still a little odd.
>> ARTICLE
It's because many of them extra seasons.

To get to Book of Circus you have to watch two seasons (many put off by the second), Hanamonogatari three seasons and Nekomonogatari kuro and for Mushishi Zoku Shou you need to watch the first season.

Mushishi is a set of loosely connected histories. One could easily skip right to season 2

Similar case with monogatari, new seasons and films aren't all released in proper, chronological order

Kaiji is brilliant.

I watched part of it before, but it was too depressing and soul crushing for me that I dropped it.  Lately I've been toying with the idea of rewatching and then finishing it, but before I do, I'd like to ask something.  Does it have a happy/at least semi-happy ending?  If he ends up just being a slave or dying or something it won't feel like the watch was worth it at all for me... so I'd like to know beforehand not to watch it if there's a bad end.  I don't want any in depth spoils, just a yes or no @_@.

Kudos to Cross Game for having the saddest first episode in a children anime.

Does Cross Game actually deliver instead of pussying out after two or three episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Please, dont think that cross game is anything like Kotoura-san. Its Adachi's most accessible and easy to watch/read series, and easily one of his best.

Adachi is the master of nostalgia high school sports, mixed in with somewhat opaque romance and usually a touch of tragedy. Its a brilliant mix, and hes been doing it for the better part of 30 years

Comparing the two is an insult to Cross Game.

Yes.

What. Did you just call an Adachi (possibly his best in many ways) series a kids show?

What would you say is the target then? The anime basically aired during a time slot that was appopriate for a younger audience.

its shounen sports that borders on sienen at times.

But adachi doesn't write your normal shounen sports ala slum dunk style, he has his own unique style

It also frequently opened with a drawing song and displayed pictures submitted by viewers at the end of the episode. That means it is, at least in part, targeted towards kids.

Let me tell you about what happened on Tuesday. I made one of the worst decisions of my life, concerning anime.

So, I had Cross Game on my PTW for a while now. Tuesday night, before I hit the hay sack, I decided to watch the first episode before going to bed, thought, "Might as well start it". 

I think you can guess what happened next...No sleep for me for 2 hours, stayed up watching 6 more episodes...Godammit...

I've got casual anime friends and colleagues who watch a series solely by word of mouth, or on recommendation only.

It's like telling a guy off for not having watched The Sound Of Music and Citizen Kane before watching the the movies now showing in cinema.

Really, there's no other prerequisite to watching anime than watching anime. We're all fans here.

No. Some are fans of what's popular. Others are anime fans and do try to know more about something they like.

I'm pretty sure most "anime fans" say they're fans but only care about watching what's popular, which is only a small fragment of what anime is.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, anime has much more depth than what's popular, but honestly, if people are enjoying themselves, then there's no harm to it. Popular shows are good for socializing and community, anyway. I feel that's a much stronger part of what we are than if we were to view anime as art, and it's where anime cons, doujins and even this sub draws strength from.

So it's only better for us if we were to be excellent to everybody here :)

For me, that's pretty old in terms of Animu. 

Then again, I like things like Rose of Versailles and Candy Candy, so yes, I can talk about REALLY FUCKING OLD if you want :3

Growing up back on the old anime forums and geocities (damn I feel old) all people talked about was Utena and then I finally saw it around 2001-2 and I understood why. It's a shame that classic deconstruction series like this are not well known but everyone knowns Evangelion (It's my favourite series but it really is kind of over rated).

I don't think Utena was ever on Toonami/Cartoon Network, though. Could very well be wrong.

It wasn't, but it was one of the first major series imported to the US en masse

That's probably why it's not all that popular, though. Most people I know who watched anime when they were younger watched it on Toonami, including myself.

Maybe? I know some kids like me were a bit proactive and started searching for imports when we were younger though.

Utena is really old, and quite niche. :(

Yeah, I thought about only putting the first entry of a series I'd encounter that fits the criteria at first, but there aren't that many in the end, and I still find it interesting when compared with the attach rate.

I always find it funny how I see people say "Mushishi is great but you should take it slow" while I'm sitting over here marathoning it every time I watch it. I specifically waited until Zoku Shou was finished airing so I could watch it all at once. Now I just have to wait for the movie.

I don't have much to add to SSVD's answer, but yeah, while it isn't everyone's cup of tea -- which is fine -- it's a fascinating show which is definitely worth a shot.
>> ARTICLE
One of my personal favorites. It's more psychedelic and trippy than SHAFT shows, but its a show about psychiatry, so it's very fitting. Highly recommended if you like dramas. The show I think it's closest to in initial impressions/structure is The Tatami Galaxy.

It is episodic in nature, but every episode runs concurrently over the same 2 week time period, so they all interweave in subtle ways. Each one is about Irabu helping people with their mental problems, and it's consistently funny and touching.

In terms of production values, Irabu's VA lifts the show up 10 points alone, OP/ED are both great, music's wonderful, the art is excellent, and I hope you like live-action elements in anime, since this goes full Aku no Hana every now and then, (probably to cover up that there's very little animation in the thing).

I'd call it a 9, as it might have benefited a little more from a stronger overarching narrative, but the individual arcs are all fantastic.

Didn't expect to see MSG: The 08th MS Team on this list, but I imagine it fell under the radar due to being a 90's OVA for one reason or another. I for one think of it as a gem. Not to mention, Shiro and Aina had such a sweet romance.

Just counted, and I haven't watched 54 of these. But seriously, we need to let others know [Patema Inverted](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12477). It's an awesome anime to watch.

It is a cruel world that would ignore the majesty of Whisper of the Heart. A very cruel, world. 

Looking over the list it's funny to see how many 'must watch' anime are on it. Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Revolutionary Girl Utena, MSG: 8th Team, Conan, Dennou Coil, and Maison Ikkoku all stand out as being among the most critically lauded shows in anime history. 

None of which I've yet to finish, mind you. Which says an awful lot about me.

I'm thrashing through LotGH at the moment. It's absolutely enthralling. Really can't stress how little it matters that it was made in 1993. It deals with things I've never seen another anime deal with, and is overwhelmingly compelling to watch one episode to the next. The only anime I can compare it to, in terms of how high a regard it holds its themes, is Monster. They're about completely different things, but the essence of how they deal with the real issues surrounding humanity is similar.
>> ARTICLE
> Revolutionary Girl Utena

What is wrong with you people? This is one of the greatest anime ever made. 


>> ARTICLE
> What is wrong with you people? 

Nothing *wrong* with these people per say... but you forget that the majority of people on /r/anime and MAL are basically the same age as Utena.  If it's 15 years or older, most people haven't seen it unless it's mainstream.

Also, most people here are guys, and won't necessarily get into things ostensibly for girls.
>> ARTICLE
I was being sort of facetious. The thing is anime is way more popular as a whole than when I was getting into the scene. There are way more of us now than there were 15 years ago. 

Anyway thanks for making me feel weird. /s It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.
>> ARTICLE
> It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.

I always found this funny.  Watching anime in general is already a niche that's, at best, looked at strangely by the general population.  The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing.  Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).
>> ARTICLE

Funnily enough even in its home country. 

> The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing. Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).

I think it goes without saying that our society is geared against folks that don't identify with the general norm. I read manga/watch anime for the art, the story and the characters but despite having all of those I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(
>> ARTICLE
> Funnily enough even in its home country.

Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

> I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(

Sure you are, do what you want!  I watch crap for kids and adults; crap for guys and girls, it doesn't matter.  Quality and artistry doesn't know gender.  Let the haters hate.  Besides, this is the anonymity of the internet too, so:

1) Who cares what other people have to say.

2) You'll find a lot more like minded people here than you would have assumed.
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

Oh definitely, tho there is rampant homophobia as well it just manifests differently (like being gay is considered a phase that kids go through in Japanese culture). But the stigma in Japan for anime in general is a lot like the stigma for watching cartoons over here in that its still seen as something primarily for children. 

> Sure you are, do what you want! I watch crap for kids and adults; crap for guys and girls, it doesn't matter. Quality and artistry doesn't know gender. Let the haters hate. Besides, this is the anonymity of the internet too, so:

I wasn't quite saying that I personally would change what I like, I've been watching what I like for damn near over a decade and a half now, just critiquing the dominant view. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm at episode 12 from 39 and to me it seems like the plot is just starting, while Ping Pong, the masterpiece of anime, already finished an episode ago. 

I'm definitely having fun up to this point and it'll probably blow my mind by the time I'm finished, but the show is taking it's time. And shojo's of the 90's look weird. NGE looks way better.
>> ARTICLE
You're almost at one of the best arcs ever made for any anime period, the Black Rose arc, look forward to it. 

Trust me, by the time you finish this, you'll be a believer. Just be glad you didn't get the movie four years before the series like those of us way back when. :p Also shjo, at least in manga, has not really changed since the late 80s except males have become skinnier, it's only in the anime adaptations where utena eschews a more shnen look for keeping the shjo flowery approach. 

NGE is my favourite anime ever, and yes it looks good, but so does Utena in a different way. 
>> ARTICLE
Just stumpled upon this thread and by now I have finished Utena. Still don't relaly know what to think. It definitely well done, but at face value it does so little and I am not all that good with symbolism. It had some really hilarious stuff. That's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck is wrong with you?
>> ARTICLE
Well rheumatism, arthritis, demen-wait what was I talking about again? /s
>> ARTICLE
It can be pretty painful to watch. I mean how many times must I see the stair climbing montage? Only to be outdone by the elevator taking montage. 

Also, plenty of times throughout the show I wanted to scream "What the hell are you trying to tell me?" So it can be a frustrating show for people that are driven by plot as opposed to themes and symbolism.  
>> ARTICLE
Man the stair-climbing/elevator-taking are when things get real in an episode, they serve an important point. Repetition is a huge focus for reinforcing themes. Remember Utena is about growing up, the stair-climbing, elevator-taking are symbolic of going from lower to higher, that is becoming an adult. 
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea how Utena is so low (comparatively) in terms of ranking, both popularity and score-wise. How have more people not watched this show? I've met people who've watched a ton of anime who've never even heard of it. Is it because it's a magical girl series (kinda)? Is it because Utena's a girl? Are most people really that unwilling to watch anime that's more than seven years old? People on here talk about Penguindrum fairly frequently, and obviously a lot of attention is on Ikuhara with Yuri Kuma Arashi. I wish that there'd be more discussion about Utena beyond it being mentioned as a classic because it has so much depth to it, it easily deserves threads on the level of, say, the NGE rewatch. 
>> ARTICLE
I got bored after 14 episodes and quit watching. I can't relate to anyone in the show they are all so backwards.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly there actually were rewatch threads on here for Utena a few months ago. But only like two people posted in them.
>> ARTICLE
It's odd because all throughout the late 90s - early 2000s Utena was hailed as a masterpiece even if half the people watching it didn't understand that it was largely a coming-of-age story. 

But really Utena is to shjo what NGE is to mainstream anime, remembering that shjo while influential on the mainstream is largely resistant to the mainstream as well, an endpoint to a bleak era after the economic downturn of the 80s-90s. It was a clean break between the themes prevalent before and after. I think there are enough of us around to create a decent discussion thread. :p

Is the 'Aria' series worth pursuing? 
>> ARTICLE
it is my second favorite series behind hunter x hunter
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. I watch very little slice of life because I often find the majority of them to be mostly pointless apart from them making you feel comfy. I noticed that the Aria trilogy was quite often referred to as best SOL out there so I decided to give it a shot and it turned out to be one of my favourite shows.

 It is a coming of age story what gets better with each series and ends perfectly in my opinion. What made me love this series so much was how the main character Akari viewed and interpreted the world around her in such a beautiful way that I couldn't help but feel warm and fuzzy inside. 

The OST is also great at making you feel relaxed and comfy, here is one of my favourite songs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1hGtQxHvs 

I can't recommend this series enough, the only negative I can think of is that I found the cat's voice a little annoying initially but like the series he grew on me very quickly.
>> ARTICLE
It's an episodic slice of life anime about rowing gondolas on terraformed Mars. There is an overall linear progression, but it's mostly about the development of its characters. There's no denying it's hard to get into for most people, but it's charming and soothing, and it ends on a conclusive high note.

I would say that a large amount of the sequels could have been taken out, as they typically have viewers that decided to watch based on the first season, giving them unnaturally higher ratings. 

Edit: You may also want to think about removing those with scorers around the 12,000 mark and above, because quite a few of them are well known (At least on reddit (as it seems to me))

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Big Windup! is one of my favorite sports anime so I'm glad its getting the recognition it deserves
>> ARTICLE
Dennou Coil is a masterpiece. It really is just about perfect. 

It has an interesting and well thought out world. Characters are likeable and relatable. The story has a well pacing, is interesting and actual works out. The soundtrack, while nothing really special, is used very well, always fits and underlines the atmosphere, but also knows when to be silent.

But I'm sad X, Arjuna or Giant Killing didn't make it. At least X could've managed to get it. Clamp manga animated by Madhouse? It should've been popular. Arjuna has Yoko Kanno's best work, but a weird story. I like it.

**BUT** how in fuck did Inu Yasha get in there? Judging by the 120 episodes I watched before droping it, it isn't a contender for top 100.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen InuYasha, but this is the second season. To get there you must have already went through 167 episodes, and judging by the description, it seems to be much faster paced (covering 21 chapters in 26 episodes compared to 35 in 167, from my understanding), which must contribute a lot to its high rating.

There is quite some stuff on that list that I adore(Cross Game, Chihayafuru, Kaiji, Gin no Saji, ...) but it makes sense.

I got to most of those through checking the Top MAL scores and not because they got recommended or written about.

But there are also a lot of em that seem to sit on my ptw list forever, since there is always something "more important" to watch.

I've seen quite a few of these shows mentioned here but haven't watched them yet, I should really get around to that. The attach rate is interesting, most shows are below .6. It would be interesting if MAL included that stat itself so we could compare shows by what percent of  people dropped/finished it more easily.

How do you put Hellsing Ultimate on hold o.O
>> ARTICLE
probably because it took like 6 years for 10 episodes to be aired at a pace of 1-3 episodes per year. some people just got tired of waiting and haven't bothered to finish it yet.
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming there were a lot of people who put it on hold because they were waiting for the last 2 episodes to be dubbed and haven't gotten around to watching them yet. (I'm in this exact situation)
>> ARTICLE
But... there are subs.
>> ARTICLE
The Hellsing Ultimate english dub is widely considered to be better because the characters have fitting accents, in addition to it just being an overall good dub.
>> ARTICLE
Ok... I'll have to think about which I'm gonna watch before watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely dub, you gotta get those over-the-top German accents in all their glory.

And Crispin Freeman as Alucard.  It's why I watched it dubbed

Man Romeo's Blue Skies is amazing, although I guess I can see why people wouldn't like it. My parents got me into classic literature at an early age, so I'm a sucker for stories like this.

Is there a way to find the shows with the highest plan to watch vs completed ratio? 

Basically, the shows everyone has on their list, but they never get around to watching.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean like in the case of Gintama where only 28% of the users that have it on their list have completed while 51k (Also 28%) out of 178k people are planing to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, seems like an interesting measure, Legend of the Galactic Heroes has more people who plan to watch it than who have actually completed it, for example.
>> ARTICLE
It should be possible but kinda hard to pull off since not only is the data on the website really off sometimes but you also can only sort by a single field. 

I've tried limiting the number of members that have the shows on their list as well as limit the complete and plan percentage so it kinda looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KW8wFUU.png) but then you've to deal with the wrong data like in Jinsei and M3's case.

Scraping the data from MAL directly might yield better results but I've no idea how to do that. You could try playing around with the settings [here](http://test.animeadvice.me/#state/plantocompleteratio) to give you a better list but it won't be really 100% accurate.

Death note getting put on hold and dropped this much....I guess this is what happens when people over hype the shit out of a good show.

Well... the reason for most of the shounen anime drops are cause the manga is just so fraking far ahead. I gave up on shippuden by the Hidan and Kakuzu ark. And i recently read like 100 chapters to finally end the 10 years of watching and following Naruto.

[Naruto ending spoilers](/s "The ending was pretty appropriate but the last boss was kinda shit.

Really impressed with Parasyte popularity rise .  surpise no Bahamut in there .  
>> ARTICLE
Bahamut is actually not anywhere near Parasyte's popularity (Only half as many MAL members have it on their list). The popularity list for this season goes like this:

1. Parasyte
1. Psycho-Pass 2
1. Log Horizon 2
1. Fate/Stay Night: UBW
1. Amagi Brilliant Park
1. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso
1. Trinity Seven
1. InoBato
1. Grisaia no Kajitsu
1. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah was suprise to I see alot of people talking smack about psycho pass season 2  and log horizon 2 right now how its bad compared to season 1  so was shocked to see them above UBW considering its popularity. My guess is people are confused on the order of the fate series so alot dont watch it yet

It's melodramatic, poorly written at times, and crawls at a snails pace. The flashbacks that repeated the same thing over and over triggered my GGO PTSD. It's a good show, and I'm certainly enjoying it, but calling it a masterpiece just devalues the shows truly deserving of that title, IMO.

Fate/Stay night from DEEN is listed higher than Fate/UBW from ufotable? ^^^jesus^christ
>> ARTICLE
Haven't watched any of Fate series, can anyone tell me why is Fate/Stay night so hated while everyone loves the other series?
>> ARTICLE
Um....its complicated. 

The F/Sn that is hated is the 2006 version. Its considered a very poor adaptation of the Fate route of the F/Sn visual nove,especially in regards to the protagonist. It has plot points and spoilers from the 2 other routes, and because of mixing up all those it suffers from pacing issues.Also the animation is very poor and hasn't stood the test of time.

The other 2 series are F/Sn Unlimited Blade Works- which adapts the 2nd route of the VN very faithfully and is a great anime overall. And Fate/Zero- which is the prequel of the F/Sn anime, and is considered one of the top tier animes to come out in the last 5 years.

There are other stuff related to the Fate franchise- Fate/Kaleid which is an alternate universe thingy but still loads of fun apparently, the Unlimited Blade Works movie which is made by the same studio of the 2006 version and also considered pretty bad adaptation unlike the newer series.

Hope that was helpful!
>> ARTICLE
so if i want to start watching fate what order would you recommend?
>> ARTICLE
So basically it is hated because DEEN fucked it up. I just started watching it(going to watch whole franchise), and i can understand why it gets all the flak. The animation quality is by far the worst in any anime i've seen(haven't seen that many, i'm more of a manga guy). 

The overall production is just piss-poor by not just the standarts of 2006 but even the entere 2000s.

Your comment was very helpful, thanks for taking time to answer me!

PS: A couple episodes in and i see why Saber's the best girl.

Yeah, DEEN certainly dropped the ball on this series. So it kind of deserves the criticism it receives.

Saber romance brah, people love it, and Japan loves Saber.  I wouldn't go so far as to put F/SN above UBW.... but I can definitely see the appeal of it.  Saber's romance arc is still touching, even if it wasn't adapted exactly as the VN had it.

But...but Rin...how could they not like Rin?

Yeah I like Saber she's awesome and all but, Rin is so much more interesting, fun, and a strong female lead. 

Ugh what the hell Japan? I just can't see it.

Also Rin was the only one in F/SN who didnt betray him.

They do like Rin, just not as much as Saber, and they are correct ;P

Nuuuuuuu
>> ARTICLE
Saber's romance was not only horrible but her character is just asinine. She's like the least likable character in that show, and I will never understand why she's popular. Fate Route was horribly average, and it should only be slated as average. UBW and HF are incredibly better, and so are their heroines. I'm probably going to get down voted for this but whatever, I just can't stand her nor her nonsense. 

In my opinion:

Heaven's Feel > UBWRoute > UBW Anime > A ton of shit(including FZ) > Fate Route >>> Fate Anime >>>> UBW Movie
>> ARTICLE
Tell me how you really feel.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I'll just summon /u/darthnick426 and get it over with.

There's literally no point in debating with someone with such obviously bad taste.  Just let him stew in his own edgy salt.

>> ARTICLE
At this point, it's just different taste, not bad. It doesn't mean that you like Saber that you have bad taste, just not the same taste as me. The contrary can also be applied. While I did say that I did not understand why someone would like a character like Saber,  I never judged anyone who actually did. 

We are talking about fictional characters at the end of the day. People will dislike some, and others will dislike others. I may disrespect a character and you can too, but there's literally no reason to disrespect each other because of our divergent tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
> Saber's romance was not only horrible but her character is just asinine. She's like the least likable character in that show, and I will never understand why she's popular. 

This entire statement is contrary to what you just said. By making this claim you are judging her popularity and by extension judging why people like her. If you were just talking about the character, then sure, your earlier statement you stated rings true but you went and said you'll never understand her popularity. That undermines your entire argument man. So even if you didn't mean to judge people for liking her you've unintentionally implied that and mostly come off as someone who's just annoyed with Saber fans for making her popular.

I was mostly joking for the most part anyway. Saber is indeed my favorite and I banter often that the other girls are shit but I'm joking at the end of the day for the fun of it. I like or at least appreciate basically every character in the Fate Franchise. Except for Shinji. Fuck that guy.

You must be new to anime, If you're the MC you can do whatever you want to your romance option and it does not matter

Its the culture difference I suppose
>> ARTICLE
No I'm not new to anime. I don't think anyone who actually seen a 40+ hour visual novel is new to anime. He treats her like shit, and like the shallow veggie she is, act as if it bothers her but does nothing about it. Her apparent growth was extremely shallow and sexist all things considered. So much that I will not consider it growth but digression. I feel like Saber is an insult to actually strong female characters. She can fight, but she doesn't have the mentality that makes a character strong. 

Sakura also doesn't have it, but she got an interest enough character conflict that I can look past it. Her personality is also pretty well rounded. Rin is just extremely badass in terms of personality and is a character who's portrayed much better than most women in such fiction. She's ultimately perfect.  
>> ARTICLE
And the MC is just bad in general, doesn't make saber any worse. 

Rin is perfect you say, so saber is missing the tsundere ? 
>> ARTICLE
Rin Tohsaka. (I made an essay or something like that about Rin a long time ago, so here)

Rin is without a doubt the deuteragonist of FSN. For a character usually known as a tsundere she is one of the most complex characters in the Fate Series. She has many layers. First, in her day to day, we see the perfect student persona. This way, she keeps herself away from the normals so she doesn't have to hurt them if they find her secret. Then we see how she behaves once she relaxes a bit, with Ayako. And we see a person who is witty and likes have verbal fights while maintaining a facade of elegance and aloofness. Behind that, we discover the cold magus that she likes to think she is. That's it, until Shirou breaks through that layer like a sledgehammer (punny) and we finally see the tsundere. And that's not even her final layer. Once Shirou (and the watchers/readers) see whats behind her magus persona, we see a character with flaws, flaws that in my case endear her to me even more. She is stingy, has a short temper, is lazy and weak in the mornings, isn't honest with herself about her feelings, is a bit of a manipulator and likes to make fun of other people.  


But she also likes to have a challenge, has a very high sense of fair play at the beginning (whatever advantages she gets after the start is another matter), wants to keep the innocents around her safe, takes her responsibilities seriously, is very intelligent and, above all, incredibly funny. She is the character with whom I laugh the most in the novel/anime. And behind all of that, we find her true persona. A kind person. In my opinion, probably the kindest character in FSN, by far (probably Sakura is the only one who is somehow close, but not that close. Again, this is my opinion). She is compassionate, and despite her words, thinks of the others around her before herself (but in a much more balanced way than Shirou, she knows to keep the balance that is her own person safe so she can measure things, to somehow use her words). 


It helps to bring my opinion of her higher that, without having a really game breaking ability (besides being a genius magus, and in a war like the HGW that doesn't help that much when you face some of the monsters of the war) or being overpowered to the max, she can take names and kick asses, even when completely overwhelmed [Spoiler](/s "oh, hello there, Caster, let me introduce you to my FIST TO THE KISSER!"). Oh, and she is cute. I can't forget to mention that. 


Rin's case is a strange one for me. I'm usually a sword and childhood friend person, and I favor the underdogs over the stars, but Rin came, looked at Saber and Sakura (sword in the first case and underdog and childhood friend in the second) and kicked them out of the ladder. Hard. And with hard I mean harder than what  [Spoiler](/s "Herk ")could do. Although Sakura managed to get near it with time. [Spoiler](/s "I blame her shadow induced almost omnipotence cheating to let her recover, or something. And Hollow Ataraxia, can't forget about that.")

>> ARTICLE
Also Saber is shit because she's shit. Shirou was shit in Fate route too, but it was how she related to him in that route that brung her character down with him. Her relationship with him, her own basic character and her asinine growth are what made her a horrible character. HA improved their relationship but sadly, her character stayed as basic as before. 
>> ARTICLE
So.....

TL;DR You like Rin as your waifu because you pretty much skimmed over Sakura as quickly as you could despite her desire and motivations literally being the most complicated of the series

Cool
>> ARTICLE
So, she is complex cause she is the average tsundere that is prideful, tough, and kind underneath. Gotcha. Makes her perfect. Gotcha.

In that end, she was portrayed as this horrible women who dared to defy her men. Ultimately, she was portrayed as if she was in the wrong for killing him, and that she was a horrible person for doing so. 

Not to forget that I stated that:


and like the shallow veggie she is, act as if it bothers her but does nothing about it.


I really want to point the fact that I stated that she acted as if it bothered but did not do anything to dissolve her relationship with Shirou, instead, she decided to hop on the very person who treated her like an uncapable piece of shit. 
>> ARTICLE
That is the connotation you have given to that ending or even that conversation. Instead I see it as an act of an independent person that has the right to chose but it is in a position where she personally doesn't feel comfortable with the outcome because of all the time they spent together.
Furthermore, the way Shirou acted was because ofhis PTSD and survivor guilt than Saber understood because she saw his past.
He was the first to treat her as a person, unlike Britain or Kiritsugu. (Well Iri classifies but because she had the same condition as her)

Spirited away not in the top 100

[](#justno)
>> ARTICLE
If Kinema Junpo polls are anything to go by, Japanese cinephiles prefer early Miyazaki to late Miyazaki, with *Castle of Cagliostro* being regarded as the best animated film.
>> ARTICLE
Japan is huge on Laputa, Castle in the Sky. It's a popular film to show to children, significantly moreso than the Miyazaki Monoliths of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke (which are too confusing or too violent for young children).
>> ARTICLE
Well it's the highest grossing film of all time in Japan, so there's at least that going for it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised Cowboy Bebop is rated higher there than it is on MAL. I always assumed that show had more western appeal.
>> ARTICLE
I believe it did have an initial poor rating, but still managed to be a commercial and critical success in Japan despite the poor start.
>> ARTICLE
That's a misconception that stems from Cowboy Bebop having a number of issues when it first aired in Japan. The series is very popular over there, it's considered a global sensation for a reason.
>> ARTICLE
It was even the Animage Anime Grand Prix runner-up and Editor's Choice winner when it came out, so it wasn't exactly under the radar even back then.

Pretty much.

Honestly a lot of the "Cowboy Bebop was a flop in Japan" comes from the idea that only "moeshit" sells over there.

I've watched the last 2 episodes of that show about a dozen times.  Truly a great series.

Sorry. Too many anime, and I want to keep the list short.

Maybe next year when I post an update.
>> ARTICLE
What I find as few surprises on this: 

* Ga-Rei: Zero is relatively high
* Revolutionary Girl Utena is still in the high 200s
* GATE I thought was a big hit, guess I was thinking wrong
* Legend of the Galactic Heroes is **not** in the top 100
* School Days is in the top 200
* Jojo, OPM, and NHK are in the 300s
>> ARTICLE
GATE had a good premise, but the harem aspect just got really grating after a while. It felt really forced and added nothing to the story. Also having a female character, that looked like a pre-teen, go into a weird orgasmic trance whenever there was a slaughter got really gross really fast... (=_=)
>> ARTICLE
I don't think those are the reasons it is not rated as good in Japan, nobody complains about harems or goth loli goddesses. It's much more likely it's about the Anime toning down the violence and not being true to the source thus fans of either the web or the light novel or the manga not rating the adaptation high.
>> ARTICLE
The violence was also toned down from the manga which had toned it down from the LN, so being a sub-par adaptation might have something to do with it.  It's also rather nationalistic, which could make the current target audience uncomfortable.
>> ARTICLE
Where could I read the Light Novels in English? I'd like to read what the author had in mind with the violence
>> ARTICLE
I'm not into LN's so I couldn't tell ya.  Even if I knew I'd probably have to pm you the site because I doubt it's legal.
>> ARTICLE
I will add that even the LN isn't strictly the original as there was a novel before that (but there shouldn't be much of a difference).

Someone seems to have picked it up. Check Bakatsuki (I'm not sure if fan-translations count as piracy on this sub so use some google-fu). Someone has translated the first book and are working on the 2nd one. 
>> ARTICLE
I think NHK hit too close to home for many viewers. It's hard to be objective about a show if it makes you gaze deep within yourself in a brutally effective way. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's not forget FMAB is ranked 30. 
>> ARTICLE
Because it doesn't take place in Japan.

Joke aside, it would be meaningless to compare both websites if they don't weight the scores the same way. On MAL you need to have at least watch 20% of the anime for your score to have weight. If on Anikore your score counts without even asking how many episodes you have watched (I don't know that) then it would be meaningless to do a comparison. 

There's also the fact that they might calculate the score differently. MAL only takes the overall score in consideration, while Anikore might not.
>> ARTICLE
> Ga-Rei: Zero

It is a fantastic thriller IMO.
>> ARTICLE
the pocky scene was thrilling for sure
>> ARTICLE
> Legend of the Galactic Heroes is not in the top 100

Probably because the rating system on MAL means only people that have watched 24+ episodes of LoGH have their scores taken into account.

So let me get this straight. They think that the Studio DEEN adaptation is better than both seasons of UBW. They also think that the UBW MOVIE by DEEN (The one with [this gem of a battle](http://i.imgur.com/93g3sId.jpg)) is better than the second season of UBW.

Sasuga, Japan. I bet the Saberfags are the cause of this.

I mean, the Fate route is the Saber romance route, and therefore the best route with best girl, and Japan loves Saber... so it's not that surprising.  If Ufotable was to redo the Fate route proper and throw in the True Ending in Avalon, I would bet my life savings that it would pass DEENs and UBW over in Japan.

This is what makes me scared to watch the Seven Deadly Sins anime adaptation.  Manga is super fun, but the anime looks half-assed.  I hope i'm wrong.

I watched it, and IMHO it's very well done. I heard some manga readers say they cut a bit off and changed some parts, but that's to be expected in an adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Seven Deadly Sins never having read the manga, and I thought it was very well-done. The humor, pacing, and animation were consistent, and the scope of the world-building and battles was really impressive.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't read the manga but it seemed fine to me, didn't have horrible pacing or quality issues from what I can tell.
>> ARTICLE
Give it a try, its a pretty fantastic series IMO. Manga readers in the discussion threads also said it was a relatively faithful adaption, only shuffling around events and cutting some details (to fit ~100 chapters into a 24 episode run) when absolutely necessary to maintain a sound narrative.
>> ARTICLE
Well, from all the positive feedback just from this i'll probably give it a go this weekend!  Thanks!

Thats wrong... the anime is also ridiculously popular. One of the maybe 5 anime you can truly consider mainstream. Is in the top 5 for anime TV ratings every week.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it's popular (although less popular than the manga), the "not so much" was meant more for the quality aspect (I mean, the anime certanly has it's moments, but over time it really lost the hang of it).
>> ARTICLE
last time I watched it, the anime consisted of 10 mins of new content and the rest of recaps, filler content (like the voice intro and stuff), OP and ED. and the animation is...well...Toei (nothing more needs to be said here)

If it got any worse then may god have mercy on the anime viewer's sole. 

EDIT:
>sole 

I am not changing that lol
>> ARTICLE
The early parts were actually pretty good, yeah they had recaps but you could generally skip them and have a good time. The thing is that they started to make each episode the equivalent of 1 manga chapter, and it's absolutely impossible to do so, things just got so slow and the pacing went to shit, along wiht the animation quality, nowadays it's just...not good...(though I have to admit they shine in the important bits)
>> ARTICLE
As a Japanese, I guess that voters who use this site is almost all of the "anime" otaku and they don't treat One Piece as an anime. Beyond that, that is the most popular/selling manga in Japan, so the manga is more popular than the anime and the fans mostly have read only manga just like FMA:B,HxH,JOJO... imo. Sorry if it was hard to read.

Out of curiosity, did you watch Castle in the Sky subbed or dubbed? Also, which would you recommend if you have seen both?

Subbed, but dubs for Ghibli movies tend to be good. I watched the old one first and then the remake just to see what has changed. Almost everything in the old one is in the new version as well. If you do not care for comparing, then you will be fine with the new one. But personally, it is a fun thing to do and the old one is not that bad.

One of the problems though with that is both Gintama and Gintama' are both on it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not just nostalgia. It was a very competent adaptation, especially for the time. In terms of animation quality both are stellar and the 1999 adaptation holds up pretty damn well.

I think what bumps the 1999 up a notch is the tone set by the use of color and sound. It used muted colors which suited the darker direction Hunter X Hunter eventually moved into (with body part traficking, gangsters, assassins, murder, and eventually drugs and cannibalism all being major parts of the story), while the 2011 adaptation continued to use the bright saturated palette that suited the series early on, but less so with every arc. Since both adaptations are highly competent, similar to FMA vs. FMA:Brotherhood situation, the Japanese audience probably rated the older one higher because the tone was more in-line with what is depicted in the story.

I actually really hate that comic because it ignores all context of the situation to make Shinji look like a bigger bitch than he is. 

By piloting that robot Shinji's mental state lowers because he's fighting shit you would see in nightmares all while feeling the pain himself (Not to mention that it sometimes goes Berserk harming him/his friends/ random people further fucking him up mentally), Misato is a slobby alcoholic who wouldn't sleep with him anyways because she views him as a child, Asuka genuinely hates him and she's a bitch anyways, and Rei [Evangelion](/s "is his sister/mother.")

Like if they left out the first panel I would have taken the comic's comedy at face value, but they include that so it just seems like a shitty argument saying Eva is shit.

You are telling me that one of the most influential series to be ever created, and what is till today the best selling anime release of all time, shouldn't be in the top 100?

I love Eva and I realize it's not everyone's cup of tea, but we are not talking about top 10 or top 3, but top 100. 

If you don't think Eva deserves a spot in the top 100, then I don't know what you think should. 

I would ask you to name 100 titles better than Eva, but that would be a waste of my time and yours.

#triggered

I can name 100 animes that has an actual ending which would beat Eva *tv* series. Also I've seen eva before I've seen the internet so I know what going vanilla into the series is like, and it feels like "It would've been better series if it had better ending and mc".
>> ARTICLE
I think most people who have watched 100 anime can name 100 anime with subjectively better endings than Evangelion, that doesn't make the characters, plot, animation, or aesthetic any worse
>> ARTICLE
but characters are badly written/generic, plot is conclusionless, animation goes to hell as show progresses and aesthetic is probably the strongest point.
>> ARTICLE
Actually The World of Golden Eggs is the best selling anime release of all time (don't ask me why, not a damn clue), Evangelion is 2nd ;P

Though, SAO will probably pass it in the near future (if it hasn't already) if we are including all season volumes.

I'll do you one better: Evangelion should absolutely be cemented in the top 3 anime of all time and it's a crying shame that many people don't see it that way.

influential doesn't necessarily = best. I don't think the original eva tv series should be in the top 100 either, on it's own it really isn't that amazing.

The ones that really surprised me with their spots are True Tears, Nausicaa, Nagi no Asukara, and Chihayafuru.

I thought the general perception of True Tears was quite awful even though it's one of my personal favorites so it being placed in the top 100 was a shock. Nausicaa, for obvious reasons. As for Nagi no Asukara and Chihayafuru... I'm just glad they have a high ranking cause both of them are true hidden gems. Nagi no Asukara was perceived well and is very well liked on the sub so I'm not that surprised, but Chihayafuru in top 10 was unexpected.

I think its one of the best shonen. Not the best action anime seeing as **spoiler alert** everyone dies in one punch, which is extremely lackluster in the practical sense. However as a whole: comedy, production, sound, visual entertainment, action, and concept it is certainly an anime worthy of praise and prestige.

This happens all the time. People dislike it when people like things they don't, so they *must* voice their opinion as loudly as possible. Eventually, people that liked it get scared that their opinion is "wrong" because the vocal minority, well, becomes vocal, and eventually stop posting their opinion. You can see that with almost any popular series, whether it was SAO, AoT, FSN, etc. Hell, even less popular ones face this.

People consider attack on titan bad? What the fuck?

Go try and say AoT was pretty good a few days from now.

It does get fairly slow after the first half of the anime, but I wouldn't go so far as to say its "bad".

Yeah SAO was kind of the worst case though. First pretty much everybody loved it and then after a while everybody seemed to hate it. So slowly most people started disliking it.
I still like it though but all the negativity has kinda ruined it for me.

Highly agree. People say OPM has its moments but it slowly leaves you unsatisfied, but I very much disagree with that. I watched the whole series twice, once right after I watched the final episode. The hype moments are still hype and its the only anime I'd consider getting a blu-ray for. People are just scared I guess.

I mean, that's what I figured, I just thought it would hold out longer from all the hype surrounding it.  I'm assuming within 4-5 months it wont be top 20 even.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the same thing with Shigatsu. Figured it would drop like NGNL. 

I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
>> ARTICLE
They aren't at all comparable.  Shigatsu started the season higher than OPM and stayed there.  OPM started out lower and rose higher based on hype, as as you can already see, it will likely drop back down to a more reasonable level eventually.

Shigatsu had a much better story than OPM as well from the sounds of it.
>> ARTICLE
Uhh... Shigatsu started at an 8 and rose to it's current score as it aired and after it finished. OPM started at an 8.5 and rose to it's current score as it aired. No different.

OPM has a +9.00 score. That's not easy to achieve on MAL. At this point I'd be surprised to see it drop below that.

> Shigatsu had a much better story than OPM as well from the sounds of it.

And that's totally subjective. I myself would very much disagree with that statement. Shigatsu has a clear and complete story, but not necessarily a better one.
>> ARTICLE
one punch man had amazing fights and music, but it didn't have a story holding it together like shigatsu which is important to an anime holding its rank.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama would disagree.
>> ARTICLE
> Welp, I'm all for letting people like what they want, but IMHO even fans of SAO will agree that is preposterous.

Fan of SAO here, it kind of depends how you're ranking it.  In terms of my favourite anime that I enjoy watching, it's easily in my top 20, probably in my top 5 even.  Considering these sites are more or less popularity contests, then of course SAO is going to be top 20 in Japan.

If we're talking about the quality of a show, then SAO being top 20 might be pushing it a tad, but I could see top 100 argued depending on one's perspective.  But I could also see an argument that FMA:B being #1 on MAL is equally as absurd.  Why is FMA:B above Shirobako?  I think that's ridiculous.  Of course, not everyone is going to agree with me, such is the realm of subjectivity ;P
>> ARTICLE
Yes, if people rank it based on enjoyment I've got no problem it being in the top 25, I wouldn't agree with it, but I would find it fair. Now, it's *""""supposed to be""""* based on quality, that's why I just can't find it in me to let it have such a high position, it's just that...I mean... even if you're a fan you've got to agree, there are at least 16 series/movies that are more well done, I know it's a subjective thing but throw me a bone here...

Now with FMA:B, yes, I also don't think it should be 1st, but it's got enough quality that I won't really find it unfair or extremely ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
> Now, it's """"supposed to be"""" based on quality

You and I both know that never has been the case nor will it ever be ;P

> even if you're a fan you've got to agree, there are at least 16 series/movies that are more well done, I know it's a subjective thing but throw me a bone here...

I already said I did!

I find it ridiculous.  Even in my limited anime watching experience I can already name a couple of shows better than FMA:B, I imagine someone who has seen far more than I could do better than 2.

How is School Days better than Welcome to the NHK?
>> ARTICLE
Forewarning. This is just the my off the cuff ramblings. Bullshitting because I am bored and it somewhat makes sense to me.   

**TL;DR: Wider range of viewers = wider range of tastes.**

The reason there are shows that are in drastically different slots ranking-wise could be because of how readily available anime is in Japan. 

It's their regular animated television over there unlike it is in the Western world. 

Kids as young as 1 all the way to adults old as 80 are subjected to it over there. That's a muuuch wider age range for possible anime viewers. Meaning muuuch more possibility to have different shows be more popular. Then that factors into female viewership as well. If this and other boards are any indicator, there are far more male viewers than female in the West. Think of how that would change if every girl in Japan was subject to seeing anime everytime they turned their television on. Anime is their animation. What all this means is 14-20 something males (just generalizing this figure) would be the average viewership instead of the dominate viewership. Giving a wider range of likes and dislikes. 

Lets say SOA viewers in Japan range from 5-14 (makes sense as you could think of it like TMNT and GI Joe's was for me or you as we were kids). The boys would watch it for the battles. BUT WAIT! It has a bunch of cuteness to it. So the girls who are subjected to watching tv in Japan would be watching it for it's cuteness and the romantic story. While over here in the West, the ones subjected to it would mostly be the 14-20 somethings who actively seek out anime. Mostly boys. Mostly people who are well aware of quality. 

As for Studio Deen Fate/Stay Night, it could simply be attributed to the Novel. Which the main story is Sabers. In which people would want to watch her stories over Rins. Which could account for more votes. 

I also think there may be a discrepancy between what Westerners and what Easterners decide is quality and there definitely is a big discrepancy between what we all consider is normal.

I can't speak for the VN, but the anime is one series I heard a lot about before thinking of watching it.

I agree; I loved the second season, but it seems like a lot of people - at least on reddit - either thought it was bad because they think it's forced melodrama, or simply preferred the more lighthearted season 1.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. There's a few anime I'm surprised aren't on here. Would have expected One Punch Man and Fullmetal Alchemist Brootherhood to be a bit closer to the top. I haven't even watched Gate yet either. Guess I should check it out.

Those are Western hyped shows.  Japan has vastly different tastes ;P

The rankings are really odd on this site.
Some shows are too high or low in a way that makes little sense, as in, don't reflect the sales or the overall popularity the series had in Japan

On the other side Yuki Yuna is on Fall 2014's top 10, which is cool.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam SEED is #2 what
>> ARTICLE
Ha HxH 2011 is so low.Kinda surprised.Also Gintama is so high. FMAB is also low. LOGH  just 2 places from top 100.
Also SAO eh not suprised.

Wow my 2 favourite anime are tied at 22 (Natsume + Nagi no Asukara)

Wow, no Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal, no Detroit Metal City....oh man, NO Great Teacher Onizuka!...what is up with this list :/...it seems like its only major popular titles :/

This is based on popularity, and not how good the anime actually is according to the Japanese, right?

It's both combined. I don't have how the math works, but these are the overall score.

I'm... very okay with it.

Bleach, rank 366, has 366 episodes....that's actually really cool.

Wow thats pretty interesting, Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day
being rank 8 alongside Clannad: After story. I was expecting them to be lower ranking!
>> ARTICLE
Here is a reminder Most Japanese don't use rating sites like the west and this site is not reliable, it also use the reaction from twitter and other sites to determine popularity so this not "what is the best" ranking you can go to site and see how people rated the Story/Visual/VA/Music/Character but still no reliable.

Sales are better way to determine Japanese taste also TV Rating if they are available. 

Edit: thinking about this have the opposite problem of MAL that Sequal gets rated higher here it gets rated lower lol.
>> ARTICLE
Something tells me Japan likes first seasons more no matter what. 
>> ARTICLE
This is so weird. But, considering that Gintama takes up about 5 spots of our top 10, this ranking also seems fine.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Haruhi and GITS at the top.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a little surprised SEED is the highest rated Gundam according to this list
>> ARTICLE
The highest rated gintama is only 32? As far as I've watched it's basically meant to watch for Japanese people, cosidering the amount of Japanese culture references, and MAL has 5 or more of them in the top 10? Weird.

I don't know what to say about this list but honestly, from either an objective perspective or a subjective one I can't agree almost at all with this order. And I'm pretty sure when it comes to te sale numbers they don't match this data either. It's just weird :/

My thoughts:
Happy that *Cowboy Bebop*, *Evangelion* and *Madoka Magica* are so high, but I'm actually surprised they're not higher.

At least Evangelion is kinda high up on the list unlike MAL's list. Also sword art ahead of Gurren Lagann makes me kinda butt hurt
>> ARTICLE
There's no way in hell Hunter x Hunter (2011) could be reasonably considered #600, do people really ignore it because "hurr hurr old version is better"? or maybe Hiatus x Hiatus ? 

However, it's refreshing to see some Ghibli titles not this recognized in the west like Castle in the Sky or Nausicaa in the top.
>> ARTICLE
Based on the scores it seems they use a 10 point scale instead of ratting everything at least a 7.
>> ARTICLE
the rating system is 1.0 - 5.0 across 5 categories: story, visuals, voice acting, music, characters. and the full rating is the average of these 5 scores

but the scores listed here aren't user ratings. they are combined scores calculated from both ratings and popularity
>> ARTICLE
At least Gintama is in the top 50.

Hunter x Hunter is 600 WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK. Why would they think the 1999 version is better in any way?

>> ARTICLE
I can't upvote this enough.
>> ARTICLE
Serious question: HxH ? Why? 
>> ARTICLE
Awesome cast of characters, A vast world to explore, great villains and the best character development imo.
The anime ended in a good place where if togashi writes more manga it could open endless possiblities for the show,
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched it and are questioning it? Or have you not watched it?
>> ARTICLE
I have not watch it and was looking for an opinion about it.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because HxH on 2014 had the best year-run of episodes anime has ever seen, with the ending of the anime and especially the ending of the Chimera Ant Arc, best arc in anime history hands down.
>> ARTICLE
If you are in anyway remotely interested or not put off by action/adventures with strategic battles and high episodes counts, I'd say give it a go. In fact I'd say give it a go anyway. 

Hunter x Hunter is a show that starts off good and only gets better with every episode. It's has amazing characters (in particular its villains) that carry an incredible story. There's an over arching plot line but really its "the little detours" our protagonists go on that makes HxH really special. 

I won't tell you what it's actually about because I think it's one of those shows best experienced embarking on the journey from episode one knowing nothing at all. Just a tip though, the second arc (Yorknew city arc) will make you mind up to whether the show is for you or not so if you dont like that arc, there's probably no point watching the next hundred episodes. 

Hope that helped and you decide to watch it. It's not highly acclaimed and AotY contender for nothing.


>> ARTICLE
Thank you. As I am right now picking a new series to watch the ones that have caught my eyes were Legend of the Galactic Heroes or HxH.

Both are lengthy so I didn't want to comit to a large series if it wasn't good at all.

Thanks for the opinion bhvgcf!
>> ARTICLE
would you meteor?
>> ARTICLE
You're welcome :) HxH is one of shows you just gotta share

edit: grammar yo
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching the show a few days ago. I'd say, at the very least watch through the Greed Island arc.  That was probably my 2nd favorite arc.  The Hunter Exam arc was my favorite.  But Greed Island finally starts to give you a taste of Gon's power.  It also has the best ED: "Reason".

The Chimera Ant arc is very, very different from the rest of the show, in my opinion, and dragged on for way too long. It ended extremely well though.

Overall, the show is great, the soundtrack is very good, and there are many cool characters.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. This is pretty much the exact opposite opinion of most fans. The Chimera Ant and Yorkshin arcs are overwhelmingly the most popular, and Greed Island and the Hunter Exam are generally the least popular.

If you really liked the Hunter Exam that much you might be interested in checking out the 1999 version of the show. While everything else may be up for debate, I think most would agree that arc was definitely better in the original.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Greed Island was by far the worst arc for me
>> ARTICLE
That's really interesting to me.

I really don't get why Yorknew is so beloved. I'd rank the Arena arc above that one. The Phantom Troupe had some interesting characters, but they were underutilized.  It revolved around Kurapika mostly, and Kurapika was honestly a pretty boring character to me, despite being voiced by my favorite seiyuu.

The way the Chimera Ant arc wrapped up was fantastic and really surprising to me...but it really changed the tone of the show for me, and it just wasn't fun for me for the first 20 or so episodes of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
YES! Everyone I've met loves the Yorknew arc, and while I wouldnt put it above Heavens Arena, it wasn't very fun. The only interesting parts were the auctions and the [Ep. 50-ish](/s "Kurapika vs. Uvogin fight.") Everything else was mediocre, but maybe that was because I had read up till the very beginning of Greed Island in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, 2011 Hisoka is the best thing to grace anime, without him what's the point?
>> ARTICLE
Greed Island was amazing. Currently on episode 114 (the narration-heavy episodes). So far the Chimera Ant Arc is my favorite. Initially I was put off by it's length and told myself that since it took up almost half the show, it better be pretty damn good. So far I haven't been disappointed. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude get off reddit. If you're on episode 114.. You must continue immediately.

Btw chimera ant arc is my favourite arc but I didnt really start to love it until the final 20 episodes, so if you love it already you're in for a wild ride mate.
>> ARTICLE
The assault was one of the most intense load of episodes I've ever seen.

"Only 30 seconds had passed" but we saw like 5 episodes, it was beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Everything I knew about good pacing prior to those episodes screamed "this shouldn't work" but the intensity and just all round amazingness that was taking place made me not care. Especially 116 onwards. Incredible.

I gave a quick scroll on the other comments, although I did not watch  Ping Pong yet, I feel confident enough to give my vote to Hunter X Hunter (2011), this revitalisation and also continuation really bought one of my favorite manga and anime series from my childhood back to life. Hisoka is still a creep perv though.
Honorable mention to Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season, one of the few "Sports" anime that is actually great, a step above Prince of Tennis in my opinion. Not sure if sports or battle anime though, the guys from KnB and PoT could easily be in a fighting genre anime with their powers.

Still haven't seen the second half of Wixoss, the first half of Fate, or the terror anime but I feel like those 5 are probably gonna stay in my top list. On my personal list I wouldn't put on Parasyte since it still airing this doesn't count and would add silver spoon instead, but since this subreddit has such terrible taste nobody added on silver spoon. 
>> ARTICLE
You can add Silver Spoon yourself. 
>> ARTICLE
This is such a hard choice, but I have to go with No Game No Life. It is probably in my top 5 anime (yes, I do have shit taste). My other picks would be F/SN UBW, KLK, and Akame ga Kill. Hunter x Hunter is also fantastic.

Agreed! I would personally argue it's my favourite of the year, next to Nozaki-kun and WIXOSS.
>> ARTICLE
My top three are probably Barakamon, Ping Pong and Witch Craft Works. WIXOSS was unexpectedly good too, and Nozaki-kun was hilarious 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Ping Pong, but Witch Craft Works was a fun show as well. But I can't say it was among my favourites. It did have, by far, the best ED of 2014.
>> ARTICLE
You should try Ping Pong out. Especially if you've tried Yuasa's other works like The Tatami Galaxy and Mind Game. 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is overrated, it was good but not that good.. that is my humble opinion at the very least.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, it has extremely well written characters, but almost everything else about the show is rather unremarkable. Or distracting like the art style and animation. The characters carry it to an 8.5  *at best* imho. Aoty for me is Parasyte; HxH had some great parts, but it also had terrible parts(overall probably close to an 8.5 as well). I cant even think of something to complain about Parasyte off the top of my head.
>> ARTICLE
If I were to complain about Parasyte it'd be something along the lines of the side characters being very one-dimensional and undeveloped, but all in all I agree, AOTY 2014.
>> ARTICLE
It's all up to the person if they like it or not, I've heard it's high on Character Development, which is what I want in anime.
>> ARTICLE
It did have impressive character development and the story was good but not even close to as good as people want to make it seem but it's pretty lackluster in the remaining areas, honestly I believe it to be the most overhyped series of 2014... not to say it's bad because it's definitely not.

Keep in mind that many people haven't seen Ping Pong, so it would still be understandable even if No Game No Life beat out Ping Pong.

They should have something to compensate for the dependency on having seen it.  It would be interesting if we could see votes and rankings for anime *after* controlling for what anime people had seen in addition to it.  My guess is that more people would pick No Game No Life over Ping Pong, but that if you *controlled for people who had seen both* it would be a lot closer.  That's just one of the demerits of these polls.

2014 felt pretty lackluster for me at least, very few anime above an 8/10.  

That being said Ping Pong and Mushishi were easily the best, if I had to pick a third it would probably be WIXOSS, I just loved the shit out of that series even with all the things wrong with it (more so in the second season). Parasyte deserves a vote from me too but I have a thing against voting for/putting shows in a top list when they aren't complete.

3. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun

4. Zankyou no Terror

5. Isshhukan Friends

Honorable mention to Barakamon too...I really miss Barakamon
>> ARTICLE
I feel bad voting on this because there were so many shows that I didn't vote for simply because I haven't seen them yet.

There's a big difference between not voting for a show because I haven't seen it and not voting for one because it wasn't good enough, and this poll doesn't capture that.

That said, I fucking loved Kill La Kill and it looks like it might win, so yay.
>> ARTICLE
Barakamon :(
>> ARTICLE
Make sure to vote for it in the Wild Card! 
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised witch craft works is ranked so low on mal. That show was surprisingly pretty awesome and I've heard that from most people who've watched it. 
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo ghoul and Akame ga kill
>> ARTICLE
My top 5:

1. Ping Pong

2. HxH

3. Monogatari

4. Parasyte

5. Space Dandy, but I dunno if I should include it since I've only seen 2 episodes. I've loved what I've seen though. I'd go with Shingeki no Bahamut otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
In my humble opinion these are the best anime of the year:

1. Kill La Kill

2. Parasyte

3. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso

4. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis

5. Zankyou no Terror
>> ARTICLE
One Piece?
>> ARTICLE
Add it to the wild card if you like, but remember that only the episodes from 2014 are included in this.
>> ARTICLE
Does that mean that *only* the HxH episodes from 2014 is what we are voting on as well? If that is the case perhaps you should mention it in the post, because it definitely solidifies my vote for Parasyte over it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. I just figured it would be common sense, wouldn't it? This is a poll for 2014.
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah i guess that does make sense, but few people on reddit(including myself) use their common sense lol. Anyways, I have a feeling most people would still vote for HxH based on their feelings of the anime *as a whole* instead of just the 2014 episodes even if you did edit the op for clarity.

2. Noragami 

3. No Game No Life

You can't pick a.z based on the second season because the second season started this year (2015).

Fate/stay night: Unlimited BUDGET Works
>> ARTICLE
How is NGNL higher than Parasyte and Kill la Kill? -_
>> ARTICLE
While Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun was pretty good, I don't think it deserves to be top show of the year (as it currently is ranked). For me the only two choices were Mushi-shi and Your Lie in April.

Actually somebody else mentioned Barakamon, which I would also put in for the nomination.
>> ARTICLE
At the time of this comment, No Game No Life is just about taking the lead.


I will seethe quietly in rage if it manages to win.


Mushishi, Ping Pong, F/SN, HxH are all 'valid' winners in my eyes, Though personally I found Ping Pong to be such a stand out I really hope it makes it.

Yeah, but what I mean is that you shouldn't base it off of anything that happened in 2013 or earlier. Example: Naruto Shippuuden episodes 1-270 ish or wherever they started in 2014 don't count. Just the episodes from 2014 :)
>> ARTICLE
No Game No Life deserves an honorable mention
>> ARTICLE
I think i just loved it so much for the use of colour. Wasn't overly thrilled for the story line, i kinda liked it. But the fact I enjoyed the use of colour over the actual story says allot haha.

Damnit U! I don't know what to pick! Who should I vote for between Kill la Kill, Parasyte, Barakamon, Nagi no Asukara, and Shigatsu?

Vote for SAO. Clearly the best contender and only worthy of your vote.

No Barakamon there lol

You totally ruined my little joke! I was hoping you'd say "vote for anime A!" and then I was going to say "Naw I think I'll vote for anime B!" in response. One of those "why the hell did you ask me then?" type situations.

Well we both know Aoty is Barakamon, I figured it'd be an obvious choice! Lol

Shows that get 2 spots on polls are getting owned by spoiler effect.

The lack of love Your Lie in April gets is frustrating.

Go Shigatsu !

Mine would be

1. Barakamon /  Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun

2. Parasyte

3. D-frag

4. Ping Pong

5. Amaburi

>> ARTICLE
No Parasyte?
>> ARTICLE
It's going by the japanese names first. The list in the post has them in alphabetical order, and it's listed as:

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-)
>> ARTICLE
Ah, thank you. I should have read more thoroughly or done a quick ctrl + f.
>> ARTICLE
No problem. I think next time around I'll do it the other way, English names first and Japanese names in the parenthesis. 
>> ARTICLE
The results are looking good. Maybe this can inspire Togashi to continue and finish the story.
>> ARTICLE
Lol
>> ARTICLE
Wishful thinking
>> ARTICLE
If this gets a 3rd season, I hope they ditch the 3d CGI altogether because the next arc is the best (and longest) in the manga so far. 
>> ARTICLE
they ditched the 3D CGI in season 2
>> ARTICLE
The manga is really good, so I can vouch for the story elements. It's hard to go from  the manga to the anime, especially considering its 3D, so I probably won't watch it though :(

>> ARTICLE
The animation goes from shitty to average by the end of season one. In season two it's actually pretty good, they ditch almost all of the CG.  
>> ARTICLE
Replace the WT with RT, and fuck yeah. the manga is just awesome
>> ARTICLE
since i do not do manga writings, i wanted to give attention to this series, whether manga or anime

besides, i personally see some merit in Kingdom's anime adaptation, which is really surprising given my distaste for the animation of the first season
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't get over the animation. There were many many awkward moments where they tried to insert anime facial expressions/typical tropes and it seemed like very bad timing and killed the mood. The body movement was also far from perfect iirc. I really wanted to like this, but... :(
>> ARTICLE
The story sounds really interesting and the character development sounds pretty great, somewhat akin to Reinhard from LotGH. However, I tried to get into it a while ago, and the animation is *ass*. Low framerate 3D is really unappealing to me. I can get behind older animation styles, but the animation of Kingdom is uniquely awful. Maybe I'll try to get into it again at some point because it sounds like it would be awesome and I would love the story. Or then, maybe I'll just read the manga since the story and characters are the draw, not the visuals.
>> ARTICLE
what the anime did do good, is i personally think it captures the atmosphere and excitement of the battles better, and also that Xin's growth as a character is more subtly portrayed and has a certain sense of build up, creating noticeable small and meaningful changes as the story goes along

it was a huge mistake of them not implementing the gore though, as it could've made the battles even better
>> ARTICLE
> Or then, maybe I'll just read the manga since the story and characters are the draw, not the visuals.

I'd say just read it. Its a great read, the anime doesnt really live up to it imo, tho it prolly does improve in the 2nd season
>> ARTICLE
>However, the animation works fine, is adequate at delivering the scenes, and **does not really distract me from the show itself**. 

god NO. it can't be emphasized enough how bad and distracting the animation is. 

do yourself a favor  skip the anime, read the [manga](http://myanimelist.net/manga/16765/Kingdom) instead. 
if you like amazingly detailed art, rags to riches story, and sword and armor battles on an epic scale, the manga will not disappoint. it's #12 on MAL for a reason. 

meanwhile the anime looks like shit, the MC has a really annoying voice actor, the music is so forgettable and the best part of the story happens after season 2 anyway. 

>> ARTICLE
well, i do apologize that i did not know you have the ability to decide what i personally can or cannot tolerate

funny jab aside, that would be your opinion, and though i somewhat share the sentiment that the manga is miles ahead, i can see some merit in the anime, and i also personally do not enjoy employing hyperbole, especially when it comes to clearly subjective assertions
>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite mangas. I've seen a few clips of the anime and I don't think i'll ever be touching it though.
>> ARTICLE
i think i made a mistake in writing a recommendation instead of a review, since i really want to touch upon the merits and disadvantages of the anime adaptation when compared to the manga

though, do not know if it is enough to convince manga readers to watch what they already have read

The biggest tragedy of this event will be if Ping Pong loses Spring Anime of the Season to fucking No Game No Life.

***Wild Card***

If something was wrongfully shunned and *not* submitted, add it as a reply to the second level comments below, each saying a season! The comment I have responded to this with will be the judge. If your nominee for the wild card is in the top ***5*** replied below ***AND*** above my comment in points, then it's in. 

This one is a little different, make sure that your anime ***ended*** in the season you're submitting it in. For example, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders started in Spring but it's only valid for Summer, because that's when it ended. Similarly, anything that's still currently airing but aired last year as well belongs in the *Fall* category. An example of this above is Naruto: Shippuuden.

Fall - ( Best three of the year IMO)1. Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade , 2. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, 3. Parasyte

Just a note on your comment on Tokyo Ghoul, the root a anime is also written by the author of the manga, isn't it? I mean, I still heard the manga is much much better, but I also heard they're totally different stories.

They are indeed different stories, The anime is going to have an original ending. From what I have seen the show is lazily done with no desire for the same flow the first season had. Its choppy and lacks any real story that I can see, just my opinion however.

Right? You'd think Funimation would have been all over that like white on rice. I wonder if the licensing talks are taking longer than anticipated (if they've even started yet). Considering how well the DBZ movie last year did, Funi (or any other streaming service) would be foolish to pass this up. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. 
>> ARTICLE
Wouldn't be surprised if they're simply rushing out dubs on this so that the series release can coincide with with the next movie dub release.
>> ARTICLE
>I wonder if the licensing talks are taking longer than anticipated 

IMO this is the most likely one, Toei (or whoever has the rights) knows the series is worth a lot and is likely to end up on TV at some point. 100 episodes of DB is worth a lot more than most other series.
>> ARTICLE
I'm wagering that they're planning on doing a broadcast dub of it and because it announced with relatively short notice for how big it is they're probably still working out the team.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but you also can't not expect people to illegally stream something if you aren't going to offer it to them in the first place. 
>> ARTICLE
Of course, and i think they totally expect that. But the amount of people who will seek out subtitled DB in the next month or so are *tiiiiny* compared to what they'll make off it in the next 5 years with the right deal.

Like yeah it *sucks*, but what can you do?
>> ARTICLE
So true. I love DBZ to death and I *really* want to support it and its creators legally, but because of its immense popularity worldwide the rightsholders are waiting for the best deal (as they should) that will make them bank (as it will). It just sucks for the fans because of all the red tape involved, we need to wait without ever knowing when we can stream it legally. The struggle is real *sigh*

Does anyone know which 3 streaming services give me access to the most diverse selection of anime? I'm in the UK so don't have access to some things. At the moment I just have Crunchyroll, Netflix and Amazon Prime. Do you think Funimation would be worth adding?
>> ARTICLE
Funimation and Hulu have more anime than Netflix and Prime. Though with Hulu you have to deal with ads even if you pay, so I refuse to get that one on principle. There have been problems in the past with Funimation's streams having altered colors and poor subs (to the point where the English subs have grammatical errors) so there's that to take into account as well.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly no Hulu here. Im going to try the Funimation free trial and see how that goes.
>> ARTICLE
Ads on Hulu is definitely annoying, but I prefer it over actual television and they do have a very large selection of content. Plus it tends to be one of the only places to watch some Funimation anime without having to put up with Funimation even with the issues. Overall it's a bit of an annoying experience, but definitely not one I would regret paying for. Plus, some older shows don't have advertisements at all (I, of course, can't recall any off the top of my head) and I mostly use it on my One. It has the best interface and filter system of any third-party app currently on the Xbox One so that's a great plus for me.

(Seriously, navigating Crunchyroll on an Xbox One is like providing energy to a Rocket's main systems with a Human Brain. In which case, Rocket Surgery/Brain Science is required and it takes about a million years to find something if you don't know the exact spelling of it or only have a vague clue as to what season it aired in. It also has extremely long load times for simple screen transitions and everything just looks *bad*)
>> ARTICLE
Never tried CR's Xbox apps, but their Playstation ones (PS3 and PS4) work great.
>> ARTICLE
Animelab has been pretty awesome at actually getting shows to Australia without us trying to dodge geoblocks, but I wish the we weren't delayed a week behind the US on some shows (Durarara and Charlotte, I think). It's not like we can watch anywhere else legally because of obnoxious licensing and geoblocks so its lose-lose-lose for viewers, Madman and whoever they're sourcing from, because we all know what will happen.

Looks like funimation  is the worst thing that happened to european anime watchers
>> ARTICLE
If Funimation's streaming service didn't absolutely suck on Consoles and elsewhere, and the webpage wasn't filled with so many useless images/code/misc. crap to slow down the webpage then I would actually bother to use it. It's also exceptionally difficult to sort through the list of things they stream on the website and it takes an unnecessarily long time to load.

I just dislike that Funimation has a large selection of anime that interests me and I have to put up with crap and pay even more money to yet another streaming service just to view it.

I've been using Funi's PS3 app for a while now, and I have fairly few issues. There's an occasional brief buffering pause, usually near the beginning with the OP, but after that, it runs fine

A bit off-topic, but you wouldn't happen to know where/when Nanatsu no Taizai (The Seven Deadly Sins) is streaming would you? There was no simulcast last season and people mentioned that it would be on Netflix after the season/during the summer, but it's still nowhere to been seen. :(

just a heads up I think you accidently skipped Hajime no Ippo for "favorite show transference"

It had 30 viewers. The cutoff criteria was 50 viewers.

Transference in particular is extremely sensitive to small viewer-count. If 4 people watched a show and 3 of them voted for it for top show, it'd rule the chart.

I didn't realize Samurai Flamenco was so unpopular. I finished watching it a few days ago and loved it.

Kill la Kill tops the charts, surprising no one (I really should continue watching it).

Is Space Dandy not any good? I thought it would be more popular just based on the director's pedigree (much like KLK).
>> ARTICLE
> Is Space Dandy not any good? I thought it would be more popular just based on the director's pedigree (much like KLK).

Good or not, it was *disappointing*, meaning expectations were not met. It was episodic, so people didn't feel compelled to keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
Which is odd. The first time I heard of it, I thought it would be a wacky space adventure with a dandy guy, and that was just what I got.
>> ARTICLE
I also thought it did exactly what it said it would do on the tin. It was a dandy show with a dandy guy... in space. It was a Watanabe Shinichiro show to the very core. 

Then again, folks around here don't exactly like episodic shows. So once word got out that it was episodic, it got a lot of flak from the redditaku. (Or should that be the hikikomoreddit...) Also too, the simu-dub caught a lot of crap as well, because dubs will always catch a lot of crap.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, it's consistently had bizarre shit going down on tons of creative alien worlds with gorgeous animation and funk music. what more could you ask for, baby?

and honestly, I like that it's episodic; the lack of connectivity means each episode is fresh and unique, and lets the show explore a lot of different scenarios.
>> ARTICLE
the ramen episode made me feel legitimately bad for meow :(
>> ARTICLE
> I didn't realize Samurai Flamenco was so unpopular.

It started out as a quirky but somewhat forgettable series. You had to wait until around ep 7 to really see it start balling out of control. It's not uncommon to have dropped the series at the 6th episode if it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.

> Is Space Dandy not any good? I thought it would be more popular just based on the director's pedigree

That's probably exactly why it tanked in the polls. Shinichiro Watanabe is not a name that can be ignored. It wouldn't surprise me if Space Dandy actually had more people watching it's first episode than that of any other  series starting that season.

It turned out that it wasn't the second coming of Cowboy Bebop, despite all the thematic similarities. It also seems to be that many people dislike the episodic format. It didn't take many episodes for interest to drop off.

All the hype aside, I think it was fine. Definitely in my top 5 for that season, including continuing from last season.
>> ARTICLE
Flamenco went the opposite way for me.  I was really into it until it started going out of control.
>> ARTICLE
Many people liked *one* mood or even *two* of Flamenco. Not many people liked them all, or even if they did, they may not have liked the transitions.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked SamFlam (all of it) but I marathoned the first half (started watching anime at the beginning of the year) so that may have played a difference. I didn't really feel it was that abrupt tbh more like WTF moments. For people who didn't like the transitions, was it because they really expected that it would go one way? Or are shows like SamFlam just unpopular?
>> ARTICLE
I thought the whole thing was so great because no matter how many times the setting changed it was still the same show that I loved from the beginning. I marathoned the first 23 episodes to be ready for the finale so I don't know what effect that might have had on my enjoyment
>> ARTICLE
oh whooo! I'm not a total weirdo then. Yeah, it really felt like the same show to me. The characters were consistent, and the show was honestly very self-aware. Admittedly Guillotine Gorilla was a big big shock, but it all made "sense" (or maybe I just have an unquestioning mind).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was weird and crazy but the only time I was really surprised was when Gorilla came because no one else had been killed throughout the show so that was big.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I'm with you. I liked it *because* it was more grounded than other animes. Then it went off the wall and really turned me off.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that's an equally important point. Some of the people who actually liked what it was doing and kept watching that long were disappointed when it took a new direction.
>> ARTICLE
Well SamFlam may not have had the most followers but for those that did follow it, almost half of them thought it was a "Top Show" as the Transference shows, so it shows most people who watched it also loved it as well.



>> ARTICLE
yeah it's the latest hidden gem type anime since so many people dropped and it and it wasn't terribly popular to begin with but everyone who stuck with it loved it. It was one of my favorites this season and definitely should have been a contender for AOTS
>> ARTICLE
Man the lack of Ippo on this list is fucking depressing.
>> ARTICLE
I've heard very good things about it, it's just that I've never had interest in reading/watching it, mainly because I'm not a huge fan of boxing. I'm sure I'd like it if I started watching it, since I understand that boxing is just a medium, and the real draw to it lies in other elements. But that whole "starting" thing can be half the battle sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
i felt almost the same way about chihayafuru before tiring of it midway through s2.
>> ARTICLE
I had literally 0% interest in boxing (or sports anime in general) before watching it, I picked it up and it has become one of the few tens I've given out.

Not trying to over hype it, but you should definitely make that first step to see if you might like it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll give it a try at one point. I do love me a good underdog story.
>> ARTICLE
Only ~30 said they'd watched it in the survey, so it didn't make much of an impact, but more than half the people who did watch it also selected it as a top show.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it and thought it's damn good. 

Do people not watch it because it's a sequel, repetitive, or am I missing something?
>> ARTICLE
The more seasons you go, the less watchers you have.

Sports shows are in general very popular, but less so on this subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
Well it is a Season 3, so its limited to those that have seen the first 2 seasons is most likely one main reason. Another is that sports animes generally arn't that big on here. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, a few of the graphs link to the wrong things, I've let him know.

Anyway, here's another thing of interest:

The most over-represented "liked shows", that is to say, the shows with the highest jump in position from how many watch them to how many voted them for top 3/5, after removing all shows watched by under 50 people. 

Another way to say it would be **"Most underwatched shows"**:

| Title  | Difference  | Change from W9| Change W6 > W9|
|:-----|------|--|---:|
|Gin no Saji - Silver Spoon Season 2|	10|+0|+2|
|Buddy Complex|	8|+4|-4|
|Kuroko no Basket S2|	8|N/A|N/A|
|Magi: The Kingdom of Magicl|	7|N/A|N/A|
|Wake Up, Girls!|	5|+0|+1|

Note "Buddy Complex", the +4 means it is *farther off* from where it "should be", the difference between its position in how many watch it to how many think of it as "Favourite" grew from 4 places to 8, from week 9 to season finale.

Kuroko no Basket and Magi didn't appear during the seasonal surveys, so there's no past data.

---

And the most negatively represented shows (meaning "**most over-watched shows**", that many more people watch them than those who think they should be top 3/5 material):

| Title  | Difference  | Change from W9| Change W6 > W9|
|:-----|---|---|-----:|
|Hamatora|	-16|-14|+6|
|Pupa|	-10|-7|-6|
|Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai Season 2|	-13|-13|+6|
|Onee-chan ga Kita|	-10|-3|+4|
|Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil|	-8|-5|-2|

Note Pupa, as weeks went by, the amount of people watching it may have decreased, but people's appreciation for it fell in a much steeper curve than the rate of those who could take no more of it :P

Chuunibyou... very popular. People *really* did not like the ending. Hamatora wasn't as popular, but I guess people also didn't care for the ending. Note, since this data is only based on "Favourite", it can mean people liked a show fine, but they didn't *love* it.

Week 6 to week 9 change for both Hamatora and Chuunibyou put them closer to "0", "0" in this case meaning a show is watched proportionally to how much people like it.

---

Of course, since you have the percentages, it doesn't really matter, if all had been "equal", it wouldn't matter how many people watch each show, but those who find a show favourite would be equal across the board. In a perfect world each show would be watched by the same amount of people (the average), and if a show is the most watched show, then it should also rank at the highest of those who think it's "really good", or so the argument goes.

Sorry, a bit rambly, again.

This time because it wasn't me tracking the changes across the season, and because the data was already tabulated for me, it was pretty easy going. I've worked about 2 hours on some of the weeks' results. Hope you people found them interesting :)

You can start a thread and hope they'll see it.

Out of the 5 Mahou Sensou voters, we also have:3 Log Horizon votes, and 2 votes each for Tokyo Ravens, Strike the Blood, and Buddy Complex.

If anything, it's surprising how little of the top favourite shows they voted for: Only 1 Noragami, Kill la Kill, Golden Time, Nagi no Asukara, or Witch Craft Works.

I have to say that I'm surprised to see both Hamatora and Gundam Build Fighters score so low.
>> ARTICLE
Do I need to give golden time another chance? I got to episode 12 and couldn't handle the stagnant plot anymore so i dropped it.
>> ARTICLE
Right around episode 13 is actually where, as the sage of the squared circle would put it, bidness just done picked up. When Golden Time did the end-of-cour break, it gave us the cliffhanger that made the entire show really make sense. It moves forward for another few episodes after that, goes stagnant for a couple, and then starts whacking people's tear ducts with a rubber halibut for the rest of the show.

Then again, things go forward with a plot even when a show looks like it is stagnant. A lot of the things in episodes 9-12 were plotbuilding devices for the second cour. Without those being shown, the second cour would never have made much sense. That's why I rarely complain about a show that starts to drag... I actually force myself to pay closer attention, because that is where the writer starts telling you the stuff that is about to happen.

But that's just me.

Can someone explain to me why Log Horizon is good? I watched the first two episodes and it didn't really live up to the SAO name.
>> ARTICLE
> it didn't really live up to the SAO name.

Well. THERE's your problem. (Someone do me a favor and find me a damn gif for that? Preferably one with Adam Savage.)

It wasn't part of SAO. It wasn't even billed as SAO. There was one major similarity between the two: people trapped inside a computer game. Everything else was different. So if you were expecting SAO to come out of Log Horizon, you would naturally be disappointed. And that would be on you for having unreasonable expectations rather than the show for not meeting them.
>> ARTICLE
It's best not to compare it to SAO at all. Other than the stuck in a game premise they are completely different.
>> ARTICLE
Still. What's so appealing about Log Horizon?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the better question is, what's so appealing about SAO? 
>> ARTICLE
To each with their own opinion I guess. That's why I'm asking, the first two episodes of Log Horizon were pretty *meh* and I'm not attracted to *meh*.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I thought it was pretty weak, it was boring throughout and at the end it even degraded into a lot harem shenanigans. I'd say the target age group for SAO is lower than LH's but even then Log Horizon just leaves much to be desired and would've fared so much better as a single-cour anime. There were good episodes, but the ones with the younger kids and other useless episodes eclipsed those that were actually productive and interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone mentioned that Log Horizon was actually a morning show while SAO was aired in the evening suggesting that the target audience was much lower for Log Horizon (the light novel was for older audience compared to the anime). I mean SAO is currently rated "M for mature" on some sites. Not too sure about Log Horizon, haven't seen any sites giving it a official rating yet (I think MAL may be "14" like some sites rate SAO).  
>> ARTICLE
LH airs at 5:30 pm. That's an evening to me
>> ARTICLE
Really wonder why someone said it was 10 am, I'll try and look for the post. 
>> ARTICLE
That (plus or minus a couple of hours) was when the streams went live on THIS side of the Lake. In Japan, it aired in late afternoon. Here, it hit mid-morning.

Time zone calculations are always what confuses these types of posts. 
>> ARTICLE
I stuck with Log Horizon until episode 16, but I just got bored. It could have really benefited from more action scenes. At least SAO did action scenes well. Not that SAO should be compared to Log Horizon, I'm just saying that a anime inside a MMO should be more action, and less "playing house"
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely slower than SAO, but it's more focused. There aren't a lot of random side-stories that string into nothing (from what I remember of SAO). If you're looking for constant action though, that's not Log Horizon.
>> ARTICLE
You shouldn't compare the two they are nothing alike except they are both trapped in a game.

Log Horizon focuses more on portraying MMO's and teamwork/learning, while SAO is more about the action, drama, and romance.

I am suspecting that Selector Infected WIXOSS & Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou will be dropping off that Top10 Spring list as we go through the season.

Average year this sub started watching anime; **2009**. Let that sink in for a minute. If a show came out prior to Summer Wars, r/anime could very well be unaware it even exists.

I was really confused by your comment because I thought you were talking about your age. Now I'm really disappointed because I thought we'd have a over 90 year old fart here.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to disappoint, I've just been watching for a long time :P As I grew up, early on I was watching things like Miyazaki movies, Sailor Moon, etc. Then anime started becoming more popular in the late 90's with shows like Pokmon, which started airing in '98 to put it in perspective. By the early 2000's Adult Swim was airing shows like Evangelion, Inuyasha, Case Closed, Lupin the Third, as well as the internet beginning to not suck as much, so anime became more mainstream and had increased access. So to me 2009 seems like a decade or so too late for most people to have gotten into anime xD

I feel like I missed out by only beginning to watch anime recently. I'm very new, and it kind of sucks.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend watching it, as it was a pretty significant movie in the evolution of how anime looks, imo. Very visually pleasing and stylized in a way that not many anime were before, but several were after. The plot was interesting, if unoriginal, as it basically was a remake of the *Digimon Movie* just without actual digimon. But I guess that's ok, as it was the same director.

Im actually fucking surprised that Danmachi was more watched than Oregairu and UBW . 

The Oregairu and Fate/stay Night episode threads are always so active with many users (like 1000+ comments for UBW alone)  never expected Danmachi to be this popular . 


Also Prison School is so underrated not even in the top 10 for summer most popular and surprise hits .So far this is my AOTS of this summer.
>> ARTICLE
I found it easier to watch Danmachi week to week.
I felt like I was forgetting subtle things while waiting each week for the next episode of Oregairu. I'm picking it back up now that it's finished.
>> ARTICLE
really easy to watch danmachi because it's story is really not that special i go to /r/anime to see what i'm missing or discuss something great to that episode, but danmachi doesn't have much to discuss and danmachi has 10%+ dropped watchers so yeah that's why oregairu and ubw is much more pack in discussions.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of lurkers that's why, plus it a show that isn't a sequel unlike Oregairu and UBW. 
>> ARTICLE
true was just surprised even though I know it was one of the most popular along with UBW and Oregairu . 
>> ARTICLE
I also find it surprising that almost all of the top 10 are 50% watched. 
>> ARTICLE
I ran out of space, so I'll continue here:

I'd like to thank mostly /u/higi1024 but also /u/Jiecut for helping me out and giving me feedback, and /u/KousakaReina for translating this to Japanese.

One thing I want to address in a future survey is the *length of the survey*. This survey was/felt too long, it got only ~2500 responses, whereas previous seasonal surveys got ~3000 responses. The length could also be a reason for the little amount of responses from /r/japan_anime, so cutting down the amount of questions is something I definitely need to do.

Another thing is that I didn't include shorts. I'm definitely going to add shorts in the next survey. I didn't include them at first since there are a lot of them, of which many are *really* obscure. I thought they'd clutter up the answers. What I didn't think of is giving them their own sections/questions, so that's what I'm going to do.

I also only included anime that *started* and/or *ended* in the spring/summer season, since I didn't want to have the same anime in more than two surveys. If I include shows that have more than two cours, that'd mean also including a couple of the long running shows (One Piece, Naruto, Doraemon, etc.). I excluded these for the same reason I excluded shorts. I can add those shows, as long as I can make the survey look shorter/less intimidating.

The final thing is that all shows only had their *romanized Japanese* names, and not also their *English* names. Frankly, this survey was really something I decided to do last-minute, since no one else did it. Since I had to do both Japanese and English surveys, adding a third name for every show would've been more work than I wanted it to be, and I wanted to focus on setting up the survey. Since everything is now set up and since I don't have university stuff to do this summer, adding the English names won't be a problem.
>> ARTICLE
Having the questions spread out over many pages makes the survey feel longer. I don't know if this is possible with Google Forms, but maybe you could have a table of all the season's anime that combines many questions into one, e.g. a dropdown next to each with the choices "Completed/Dropped/Still Watching" and checkboxes for whether it had the best first episode, best last episode, best music, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it certainly felt long because of the multiple pages. Previous surveys usually only had one page. You also tried to fit in summer stuff also in the survey. While you got more data it also increased the length.

I haven't seen this implemented but what about a grid? That would make it look a lot shorter. I'm not exactly sure if you'll be able to output the data the same way in quick summary. I don't have experience with it. But a grid would make it a lot shorter.

Also no need to sweat getting only 2500 responses. Advenna had a summer survey with 2k responses and Hemoglobin had a big demographic one with only 2k also. 2500 is a respectable number for a survey.

Yeah you got good experience running a survey for future stuff.

How's your progress with the results?

I have some projects that I've been thinking of doing. The meta survey analysis. I also want to do some big query analysis for subreddit cliques (what other subreddits reddit /r/anime users use) and vice versa. I think I can also use the bigquery data for comment face popularity, that'd be cool.
>> ARTICLE
lol I thought this was from Free Talk Friday.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean a grid like this?

 |Watching|Finished|Dropped|Picked up
-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
F/SN: UBW|x|||x
Danmachi||x
Denpa Kyoushi|||x|

That actually looks better than four lists of checkboxes, heh. higi1024 also came with the idea to split up the post-season (spring) and pre-season (summer) surveys, making it look like two shorter surveys, both of which are optional.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, please make a grid!

I never understood (and I'm sure I'm not the only one) what "Picked up" means.

* If you are "Watching" a show, you picked it up.
* If you have "Finished" a show, you picked it up.
* If you "Dropped" a show, you picked it up at least for one episode.

So what's the point behind "Picked up"?
>> ARTICLE
My understanding of it is picking up a show after it's started airing, rather than from the first episode. It helps with certain metrics because then you're able to see how first impressions of viewers may have affected people's decisions to pick up a show they weren't considering before.

Hmmm... Let's see here... I'll go with "anime seldom mentioned except by myself", instead. Because if there's one thing I love to do, it's talk about the uncommon anime I love. I've even been accused of being an anime hipster for some reason...

* [Hourou Musuko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko) is the only one of my top-10 that doesn't get a lot of traffic on this subreddit. Some, yes. But that's mostly me and two or three other people that just can't stop talking about it. This is not an anime for everybody, but it should be.  
* [Bartender](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1589/Bartender) is a criminally underwatched title. Which is kinda understanding, given the relative age of this subreddit. But it's a great choice to put your feet up, crack a beverage open, and relax for a while.  
* [Kimikiss Pure Rouge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2927/Kimikiss_Pure_Rouge) is getting a bit more attention these days, but not enough for my taste. A seinen romance drama, this one has a Best Girl that can beat the crap out of most of the wannabe Best Girls out there.
* I think I'm the only person that puts [Yama no Susume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume) forward. And I love my cute-girls-climbing-cute-mountains show. I find it just as relaxing as Aiura.  
* [Expelled From Paradise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13391/Rakuen_Tsuihou:_Expelled_from_Paradise) is a movie from Toei that doesn't get a lot of traffic these days, yet I enjoyed it almost as much as Summer Wars.  
* Everyone will mention Sakura Trick when talking about the Year of the Yuri celebration, but few people will dare broach the topic of [Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22123/Inugami-san_to_Nekoyama-san). I actually enjoyed this a lot more than Sakura Trick.
* [Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1562/Yamato_Nadeshiko_Shichihenge%E2%99%A5) is a shoujo faux-reverse harem by the same guy that brought us Excel Saga. That's right. Nabeshin did a shoujo. And it is awesomely weird.  
* [Kiniro no Corda: Primo Passo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1579/Kiniro_no_Corda:_Primo_Passo) is another shoujo reverse harem, and it is the capstone of my Music Appreciation Through Anime series.  
* [Blue Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2964/Blue_Drop:_Tenshi-tachi_no_Gikyoku) is one of more curious shoujo-ai titles around. It's like a lot more tame version of Utena crossed with Noir, and was rather unfairly panned on by most of the critics because of it.  
* [Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10079/Hoshizora_e_Kakaru_Hashi) is my favorite cheesy generic harem, and has one of the best confession scenes I've ever watched.
* Speaking of favorite cheesy generic harems, [Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13367/Kono_Naka_ni_Hitori_Imouto_ga_Iru!) very efficiently lampshades all of the little sister routes by making the MC specifically try to avoid the secret sister in the harem.  
* And finally, because I've been typing for half an hour and want to go get something to eat, [Mouse](http://myanimelist.net/anime/624/Mouse) is one of my guilty pleasure anime. It's awful, but it's the greatest *because* it is so awful.

You should do an ama, or we can do one now, like, weirdest anime ever you watched? Just curious.

Hmmm... I think an AMA should go in the Free Talk thread.

But weirdest anime? That's something a bit more nebulous. Weird as in my brain noping straight out of my skull and fleeing to Mexico in order to drown itself in tequila? Cosprayers. Weird as in not being able to easily comprehend what's happening? [Tenshi no Tamago.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/885/Tenshi_no_Tamago) Weird but still really liking it? Probably when I watched FLCL and Kyousogiga on the same day. Weird as in "Why the hell did they do this to a sequel"? Kite Liberator. 

I've seen a lot of weird anime, so I kinda need to keep it categorized.
>> ARTICLE
> I think an AMA should go in the Free Talk thread.

I guess, yeah. 

Categorizing them seems good. In-between seasons when I'm bored I watch some unpopular or terribly rated animes to rate it myself. Some were okay-ish, others are a taste thing I'd say, but most of the time I just facepalm and laugh. Last time it was Kenzen Robo Daimidaler. 

Anyway, I'll add them to my list, thanks for it.

Maybe even [Wonder Momo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22377/Wonder_Momo), if you want to see a bad anime that isn't very commonly watched.

Just please... Don't watch Cosprayers. For *years*, people have inserted the sentence "At least it wasn't as bad as Cosprayers!" into reviews of awful anime. It's truly that bad.

In other words, based on /r/anime_japan answers, **Hibike! Euphonium** was pretty popular in japan?

This gives more hope for season 2.

Of course euphonium was going to rank top for the best soundtrack! Its a music anime and the OST is very high-quality, even for anime standards.
>> ARTICLE
It's selling quite well.
>> ARTICLE
It's considered by some critics as the best anime ever produced by Kyoani.
The pretty realistic depiction of the human relations in the school club really hit home for a lot of viewers in japan I think.
>> ARTICLE
> It's considered by some critics as the best anime ever produced by Kyoani. 

Its not that i don't believe you, but have a source?

Just so i can use a link when someone says *"Hibike! Euphonium is just a moe show of cute girls doing cute things like K-on"*.
>> ARTICLE
If think it was on the second 'Hibike Euphonium' special episode of the [sokoani](http://sokoani.com/archives/9398.html) podcast that the hosts were the most praising.


There have been regular highlights in newtype/animage etc very positive about the anime, but as it's more commercial the tone is more flat and void. 

What has been intersting is that the soundtrack is currently #49 in the global amazon ranking, #5 in the soundtrack ranking, with the BD/DVD are also around #50 globally, #16 in the anime ranking.

Looking only at the numbers K-on was huge as well, but in the reviews you hear a lot of adults watching with their kids, musicians, and overall pretty mature people. Having these numbers on such a wide base is pretty unprecedented for Kyoani I think.

Well I think I know what the true sleeper hit is going to be this season (Seriously, Overlord and Gangsta are sleepers?)...or at least I hope...At least it's nice to see Akagami top that list, deserves the attention. But summer overall is pretty promising and can't wait to keep watching!
>> ARTICLE
I didn't select it at the time, but I probably would now. The more Sore ga Seiyuu I watch, the more I like it.

Dunno about everyone else but I simply took a chance on Overlord knowing nothing about it except that it has what looked like a best girl on it's front cover. Long story short, I absolutely adore the series. Like, I've never felt this way about any series ever. And I've seen Steins;Gate, FMA:B, etc.

I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not a sleeper hit by any means...just look how many comments/upvotes the last thread got.

Knights of Sidonia guys, get on it. It's a great show and the second season was just as good as the first or even better. A really well done sci-fi 3D anime that could not have been done in any other way in my opinion after seeing the production values.

Using the 3D to display the 3D space and mechs along with the sound effects have never made it more satisfying for its intense space battles.

Glad Yuki-Chan wasn't in Most Disappointing. 

Didn't see too many surprises but /r/japan_anime has gr8 taste m8. I think the most eye opening thing was how much longer /r/japan_anime has been watching and how much more they watch. 

I guess we're all just filthy casuals.

We're not *all* filthy casuals... we just average out as such.
>> ARTICLE
Well, everyone else may be but my taste is superb
>> ARTICLE
Okay onto the results.

Age distribution chart looks really cool. While /r/anime looks really young the average age is actually 20 and median age is around 19.5. Yeah that's still young but the majority aren't in high school, not that there's anything wrong with HS.

Interesting to note that not everyone lives in North America.

Dungeon in the lead with 75% is quite significant. That's a big lead and really significant chunk of people. I think the hype worked. For comparison 65% to 70% watched SAO II.

Slightly sad that Arslan isn't that popular but 33% is decent. Another interesting thing to note is that most of the top 10 are above 50% watched.

But while a lot of people watched Dungeon, only 33% of them rated it in their top 5.

I was going to say something about the vocal crowd of prison school but it's not actually on the list. % on summer shows are a bit lower but we'll see if people picked up more shows for week 3. Still the Top 5 plan to watch are solid. (we'll see if people are going to be disappointed by God Eater)

Combining age and year started watching anime would be interesting.

For shows watched per season, this can be quite a difficult question. It's interesting how you can see people like to guestimate at round numbers.

50-200 full length shows is cool. 

For some of these questions median might be a more suitable stat.

I guess that this proves that watching more anime doesn't mean you have better taste

But not as good as Accel World. Accel World had some unique and interesting elements to it, Danmachi is still just 100% cookie-cutter.

>The top 3 most beautiful and/or most visually impressing show

How does UBW not get into the top 3 of this category, let alone win it? I was really disappointed with the story but that doesn't stop me acknowledging that it's visually stunning. 
>> ARTICLE
Only the fight scenes are well done, and generally they were a step down from season 1.
>> ARTICLE
I say the background art is fantastic (not a big fan of their  character designs). Im a big jojo fan and there is no way its more visually impressive than UBW.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure you could mount an argument that JoJo's is far more visually interesting than UBW: the aggressively stylised designs, the unusual colour choices, the use of text, the 3DCG OPs, the inventive EDs. Ufotable's work on UBW, meanwhile, is often about sweeping artistic flair under the rug in the interests of consistency and a polished sheen.  The storyboarding in UBW is often kind of dull too -- unlike JoJo's, or indeed Kekkai Sensen and Euphonium. In that sense, UBW's sometimes closer to the more anodyne kind of US animation.

I don't know whether I'd say JoJo's was the third most visually impressive title of the season either, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm going crazy I swear it was on the top 3 last time I looked at it but now it's JoJo .

Oh fucking damnit, I accidentally switched it with Kekkai Sensen >.>

finishing aria just devastated me. i love slice of life but to this day it still feels like there will never be another slice of life show that lives up to aria. i love moe too and so on but the characters in aria were so adorable without using too much of the moe tropes as the selling factor. a great story about life, friendship and change while maintaining a semblance of uniqueness that i just can't find elsewhere... =/

almost done with korean zombie desk car and i like the parody/comedy aspect of it and while i like the characters, i dont feel connected enough to them to get any feels for the serious drama they try to throw in here and there. regardless of whether it's a parody of other shows that do that it just kind of makes me go mehh. still gon watch the second season though and what few eps i have left go gives me just enough time until a subgroup besides hadena subs the new ep.

I'm happy to see that people are giving Princess Tutu a chance. <3
>> ARTICLE
I watched 12 kingdoms back in 09 and I never watched the last three episodes.  After thinking about the fact that it would never be finished I couldn't bring myself to watch anime for a month or two. Sleepless nights... :/
>> ARTICLE
Man I'll never understand how TWGOK doesn't sell well in Japan. You'd think they of all people would appreciate the harem parody. Maybe they have a problem with the adaptation specifically? Too bad, since the Goddesses arc was fantastic, even missing context on some of the heroines. Makes me sad to know there's pretty much no chance for a Season 4 :(
>> ARTICLE
The explaination I heard is that apparently a lot of otakus didn't like how close Keima hit home for them. 
>> ARTICLE
Really? We're talking latter half of third season Keima right? Lol some how I'd imagine most otaku don't really fit the "God of Conquest" profile haha. But even if we're talking Season 3, I really don't think the otaku (at least how I perceive them) could get into Keima's position in Season 3, hell many charming people couldn't. I just don't buy it.

I read somewhere that the manga fans didn't really like Keima's voice actor, which I guess could make more sense. Agh this is so frustrating though, seeing something like Oreimo 2 sell nearly 10x more than something as incisive, clever, and funny (and in Season 3's case, impactful) as TWGOK. Fucking otaku. I guess I'll just read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with this explanation is that the manga is quite successful. Succesful enough to sustain three seasons and multiple OVAs, which is more than what most adaptations get.

I'm not saying that you're wrong, but I think that a lot of simple explanations as to why series x did or did not sell that make claims as to Japanese taste are a bit *too* simple, and are probably made by people who don't actually interact that much at all with Japanese anime viewers.

My explanation as to why TWGOK didn't sell that well (in anime format) would be that anime like TWGOK often don't sell that well. There are outliers, of course (look at Oreimo or IS), but a lot of harem *anime* don't sell nearly as well as many western fans think that they do - most of them get numbers that are similar to TWGOK. And while I consider TWGOK to be above-average in the genre, one has to remember that the *vast* majority of anime see sales drops with each subsequent season (for example, SAO II saw about a 15k sales drop from SAO s1), TWGOK's low s1 sales meant that s2 and s3 weren't going to do much better (even if the story improved).
>> ARTICLE
Magi didn't do that well... :(

Was really hoping for season 3
>> ARTICLE
Considering how popular the manga is, I think the anime can continue whether or not it sells well, since it seems to be excellent promotional material for the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo Rising       | 516

How is this even possible?
>> ARTICLE
Some of the best shows, in my personal opinion, did really poorly.

Aku No Hana

Genshiken Nidaime

Uchoten Kazoku

Kysougiga


I can only conclude that one of us has shit taste, haha.

>Infinite Stratos 2 | 16904

Says it all really

>> ARTICLE
Not really, considering that plenty of IS-like shows get around 1k sales. IS is very much an outlier in its genre.
>> ARTICLE
Though it's pretty avg, WA2 didn't do actually too bad in terms of numbers. Can we keep our hopes up for the rest of the adaptation??!
>> ARTICLE
Hm, so Oreimo outsold Hataraku Maou-sama!, OreGairu, Highschool DxD and Kill la Kill. Golden Time really didn't sell.
>> ARTICLE
>  Golden Time really didn't sell.

Good. Terrible heroine/MC
>> ARTICLE
Golden Time is something once you finish you never want to touch again.
>> ARTICLE
I liked Golden Time but I have to agree. It's easier to overlook some of its flaws the first time you watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Bah I want more The Devil is a Part Timer or Hataraku Maou-sama! I mean it sold better than Highschool DxD and that show is getting a new season, so why no second season of Maou. =(
>> ARTICLE
Those sales for Golden Time seem kinda painful. 
>> ARTICLE
Luckily all of the story was adapted or it would have been more painful. Did Toradora sell well since they are both by the same author. I hope this doesn't stop more of Yuyuko Takemiya stories being adapted. Evergreen is quite interesting and would like to eventually see that manga adapted after it has finished for a typical two cour show.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked Golden Time, but I would never want to watch it again, just because of Ghosthole.
>> ARTICLE
Ghosthole is the whole reason I dropped Golden Time(I think around episode 13?).
>> ARTICLE
Little Busters did really well!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it sold well for what we got. The VN is amazing so i'm always disappointed when I think how much better of an anime it could have been if the adaptation had been done properly. Although, I think the sales for Refrain are inflated from what they should have been since all the volumes came bundled with an episode of Little Busters! EX. I'm sure this was a big enough incentive for people to buy the Blurays which is why we got the sales that we did.
>> ARTICLE
Kyousougiga and Samurai Flamenco's sales make me weep. Though I'm glad they're complete stories that managed to get produced despite Japan's utter shit taste.

It still means the people in charge of those shows probably won't be able to express themselves creatively for the foreseeable future, though...

...man, I really do try to avoid jumping on the "lol Japan shit taste" band wagon most of the time, but seeing how many great, original shows barely got any sales just kills me.
>> ARTICLE
I recently saw the Samurai Flamenco Blu-rays in a random store here in austrai...maybe I should buy that.
>> ARTICLE
When a show like kill la kill sells 11000, what exactly does that mean? 11000 complete sets? 11000 individual disks? If it's the latter, that seems pretty low, lower if that includes DVDs and non limited edition sales. 
>> ARTICLE
> Sales are averaged across all volumes

Usually i'd show a number for how many volumes were released but since everything is out i didnt see the point fir this one.

Kill la kill was released over 9 volumes, so all up it sold around 100k individual units in japan

>> ARTICLE
It would help if I read the whole thing lol 

Thanks 
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see how well Lovelive did.
>> ARTICLE
The numbers are inaccurate BTW; the 2014 re-releases sold 7,857 so that needs to be added to those numbers.
>> ARTICLE
Love Live is in the top 5 selling series since 2000 irrc. 
>> ARTICLE
If you're happy with *these* numbers for season one, you better get yourself ready for the numbers for season 2.
>> ARTICLE
The season 2 were with 1 ticket for the 1 concert no?
>> ARTICLE
They still sold a lot even after the first volume. 4 of the next 6 volumes are still the top selling anime at this moment. In fact, at this current moment, the total number of sales for second season volume 1 is greater than the combined sales of *all* the first volumes of the 2014 Fall season.
>> ARTICLE
>larger updates

>and if so, how often? monthly? every 6 months? anywhere in between? let me know.

I like to see the bigger updates more than the weekly ones. Puts it better into perspective, imo. And I like when it's sorted like yours is. How about doing it after each cour?
>> ARTICLE
Do you know where I can find sales for long running shows such as Hunter x Hunter, One Piece and Naruto?
>> ARTICLE
[here you go!] (http://www.someanithing.com/2581)
>> ARTICLE
Wow, hunter x hunter (2011) sold almost nothing, I have no idea how the studio could afford making 100+ episodes with good animation quality. Most shows struggle to make 24 good quality episodes.
>> ARTICLE
It was a daytime anime fot a long time, most long-running series arent aiming to turn a profit on BD sales alone - the Anime helps to advertise the franchise itself, so they can make more money off other merchandise, the manga & keep a consistent TV audience. Long-running shonen tend to be on an earlier & more valuable timeslot than the seasonal series.

It also helps that they arent funded entirely from the sales - from what i can gather NTV headed the production committee, and as a tv station they care more about ratings so they can sell Ads - HxH did consistently well before it was moved to a late-night slot (idk after that), Shuiesha was also on the committee -they publish the manga, and for them it did a great job of selling the it. The series went into Hiatus in 2012, and in 2013 it still sold over 4 million, with no new chapters! There were others on the committee but its tough looking up info on my phone sorry

edit : also take it with a grain of salt, my sources here are mainly twitter, blogs & forums so its all a little shady - but hopefully it gives a general idea
>> ARTICLE
The Devil is a Part Timer was beaten by fucking OreImo?

Wow.
>> ARTICLE
Something that still surprises me: 

> Yama no Susume                    | 4506  

I knew my cute-girls-climbing-cute-mountains show did well, but that's exceptionally good for a show with a running time of only three minutes per episode. No wonder it got a second season and 26 episodes of 13 minutes each.
>> ARTICLE
Its a little overstated because it was only 1 volume - so 4506 is pretty much the total sales. 

Still amazing for a short though. The majority only sell in the hundreds.
>> ARTICLE
Infinite Stratos selling that much, I'll never understand.
>> ARTICLE
Its already difficult to understand the 400+ comments of people watching KanColle every week. 
>> ARTICLE
Same with Absolute Duo always gaining ~200+ comments every week too.
>> ARTICLE
How so?

Edit: I mean, it is based on actual history and real navy and military, it's an adaption of an already existing popular game and it has an immense cast, what is there not to discuss?
>> ARTICLE
I find it interesting how all shows I've seen from 2013 have sold in their upper third. That's how popularity works, indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Your list is tidier and it let us see what shows are on the top better.
So yeah, maybe monthly or every 6 months, also would love an update on 2014

Did not think I would be lucky enough to see The Boy and The Beast until the DVD release, this is great news. Do you think you will do more of these roundups in the future? This was really helpful
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to try and do this at the end of every month, assuming there's enough news to justify it. Studiocanal has the UK rights to Boy and the Beast, and they'll want it to make a big splash. Now that Ghibli is closing down they'll probably want to try and make some of their other films try and capture the same audience and Boy and the Beast seems like the kind of title that might fit in well with that. That means a wide release with an English dub for accessibility. Funimation is working on a dub right now, and I'm assuming it'll be ready for the US launch in March. We'll probably see Boy and the Beast in general release later on in the year.
>> ARTICLE
This is great! Thanks a lot for this!

One day something good will come up to Scotland...

Edit, the north east of Scotland, Glasgow is too far south.
>> ARTICLE
I don't particularly agree. Scotland has it pretty damn cushy compared to the rest of the UK. [Scotland Loves Anime](http://www.lovesanimation.com/) consistently delivers the UK's largest dedicated anime film festival in the UK, with exclusives and first screenings for tons of films across Glasgow and Edinburgh. Last year they had 15 screenings in Edinburgh ovr a week and 7 in Glasgow over a weekend. That included the EU premieres of Love Live, Attack on Titan Live Action 1 & 2 and Expelled from Paradise, UK premieres of Miss Hokusai, Empire of Corpses, The Case of Hana and Alice, Boruto, Attack on Titan Animated 1 & 2, Psycho-Pass: The Movie, The New Ghost in the Shell Movie and PMMM 3: Rebellion. They also had Naruto: The Last, Dragonball Z: Resurrection F and a screening of 15 shorts from Animator Expo.  

There's nowhere else in the UK you can watch that many films, or that variety of films. PMMM is unlikely to be shown in a cinema again, that was the only UK screening it's getting. Scotland is home to the anime film festival everyone else in the UK has to come to to see this stuff. I know I wrote a ton on this, but I feel like it's important people know that when it comes to anime films, Scotland is a first rate country. 

Edit 1: Apologies, my opening sentence was a bit too harsh.  

Edit 2: The north east is a bit of a different beast I'll admit. I think they did have a few screenings in Aberdeen as well last year, but you're right that you're not going to get a lot of opportunities to see a wide variety of stuff that far north.

Is Daisuki getting Dagashi Kashi a week late? 
>> ARTICLE
New episodes of Dagashi Kashi should go up on Wednesdays at 11am JST, which should be about 2am GMT. That makes it about a 5 day delay I think. I suspect Animax has the day and date rights to simulcast at the same time as Funimation, but they're so incompetent they're still on Episode 1.
>> ARTICLE
Well, now I have another reason to go to Glasgow. 
>> ARTICLE
A shame Glasgow is a little far for me! Thanks for the writeup though, still not sure how I feel about Funi coming over here.
>> ARTICLE
The way I look at it, at least we'll finally be able to watch Funi shows reliably, rather than having to go sailing. It'll be much more convenient, and it's not like the non-Crunchyroll services have much to recommend them.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god yes for Bham
>> ARTICLE

Ooh please do continue! I'd love to see more monthly UK relative roundups like this. 
>> ARTICLE
 this is great and very informative thanks!  hopefully funimation will be on a par with crunchyroll for catalogue and price and have most of animax's simulcasts.
>> ARTICLE
FunimationNow has a UK website currently active, and it's advertising Grimgar, Dimension W and Divine Gate as launch titles, which are currently on Animax, so it certainly seems that'll be the case. Their US pricing seems pretty close to Crunchyroll so I'm expecting them to be fairly competitive here as well. They also have Snow White with the Red Hair, which is Viewsters only simulcast for the season, so RIP Viewster I guess.
>> ARTICLE
 hopefully RIP Animax too
>> ARTICLE
Maybe if Funimation's new app is any good, I'll be able to legally stream most of my anime for free. Up until now, I haven't been able to, since Crunchyroll has a shit app and Funimation has been US-only.

Crunchyroll gave their Android app a pretty big update back in December, so if you haven't used it in a while, you may find it useful to download the new version and see if it works any better for you.

It is mildly amusing to me that A:tLA is  (anime in Japanese), but not an anime (in English).

Yup. Also Haikyuu at 9th, OPM at 3rd, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu at 73, Death Parade at 79, Naruto at 89 and One Piece at 59.

Definitely strong bias towards shows that are currently airing. 
>> ARTICLE
One piece..  Strong bias? Bruh if it finished airing it'd be rated a lot higher
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. I'm not sure about that. The story is great but the pacing for the anime is horseshit.

I love the story. However I can't give a shit about the story if it takes 50 episodes to complete an arc.

At this rate Oda might die before we see the ending of the story.

It's not what you think though, just how it'd be rated. Fk the pacing agreed

lmao Haikyuu is pretty damn good, it's pretty high up even on MAL.

OPM is good as well. Doesn't mean they're not overrated by recency bias.

I think it's cool how Avatar, RWBY, and similar shows are allowed. This and allowing for scores of X/100 are all the only things I've liked about Hummingbird so far.

There's nothing wrong with liking it, but it's a bad show on almost every level. It was like a poor man's Avatar or FMA.

How was it "bad"? It was pretty, had some nice characters, a kinda unique setting and some pretty welldone action scenes. It was a bit childish sure, but I don't think it was bad...
>> ARTICLE
The pacing was really bad, for starters. All the arcs were paced poorly. The earlier episodes were just rushed, and didn't allow you to form any sort of connection to the characters. The later arcs were drawn out and dragged on to unreasonable lengths.

The characters are some of the worst I've seen. Obviously this was to cater towards a young audience, but that's no excuse for having poorly written backstories, and shocking character exposition. Alibaba is probably the character I hate the most (save Kirito). He was written to be juvenile and immature, as were most of the characters, which honestly reflects quite poorly on the writers.

The plot was not well thought out, and was unsatisfying, especially compared to the superior Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

I always think that the top anime are superlative in their own way over other shows in their genre. Looking trough my collection I realize I don't see:

Big O- The art and English cast in that show is truly superb. The Japanese voicecast is unwatchable. Schwartzvald is a robot-piloting post-apocalyptic version of Rorschach.

Mononoke- The art just crazy and the show can be so, so creepy.

Spice and Wolf- Making an ancient epic about capitalism is brilliant.

Noir- Successfully maked a film noir that lasted 26 episodes with one of the greatest twists. (Honorable mention)

Gun X Sword- Tied with Gurren Lagann for best giant robots this decade. Rarely seen, but it was an awesome anti-hero and an anti-villain who is actually nicer than the hero.

I absolute LOOOOOOOOOVE Big O.

Infinite bamp for planetes, one of the best anime shows I've ever watched.

Although I've only seen half of those not a bad list. Personally I'd have to throw Code Geass and Gurran in there.

As for The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi I can understand that many were annoyed by the endless 8 in the second season but I for one enjoyed it. I mean I have not seen anything else like it ever and spotting the differences between the episodes was interesting.

Waiting for my 12 Kingdoms novels so I can start reading them. Wonder how it will compare considering the anime was cut short.

Hey, I somewhat enjoyed it too.

Personally, I wasn't too big on Clannad or After Story- especially After Story's bizarre ending. I *loved* the Kanon remake though.

The weird side story worked decently in the visual novel but didn't translate that well into the anime. 

Clannad is heads and toes above Kanon in my book.

I wouldn't put the Genshiken anime in the top 10. Loved the manga, the anime was great but not *that* great, especially since it left so much out.
>> ARTICLE
Overall I agree with this list, but a few that I think should be on it:

* [Haibane Renmei](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=271) - Definitely Top 10 material. As said elsewhere in the comments, excellent art and excellent music. On top of that, it's a beautiful story of personal realization and redemption. My favorite anime of all time. AniDB's tag cloud for it is amusing, too, with entries like "Unimaginably Gratifying," "Deeply Moving," and "Emotionally Engaging Style." A must-see, and not just for anime fans.

* [Welcome to the NHK](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4121) - Mentioned in OP's runners-up, so I won't go into much detail here. Suffice it to say that it's a delightfully demented show that still manages some heartfelt moments and interesting character development. It's also one of those rare cases where the movie (anime, in this case) is better than the book.

* [Hikaru no Go](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=84) - This really deserves a mention, if not a Top 10 spot, if only for how it handles the passage of time. The characters age so subtly that I didn't even notice it until a flashback much later. That itself is cool enough to warrant a mention, but the show's content is so great as well. The character development between Hikaru and Sai is top-notch. It also helps that Go is an amazing game.

* [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4575) - I would have put this Top 10, but I haven't seen Macross Frontier, so I can't judge whether it usurps the Mecha position. It definitely takes the shounen and epic cakes, though.

I'd also like to mention Ergo Proxy (for wonderful post-apocalyptic/psychological/sci-fi), Eureka 7 (for being everything that Neon Genesis Evangelion should have been), and Elfen Lied (for being scary and sad at the same time.) They're each excellent in their own right, but I haven't seen enough of your list to determine if they deserve to usurp one of the Top 10 spots.
>> ARTICLE
Macross Frontier is nice, and the music is pretty, but I couldn't really buy into it. They didn't "sell" the world or the characters or the story very well. It was more something that you aesthetically appreciated.

To put it another way, if Macross Frontier was a book, it would end up on a lot of teachers' reading lists as the well-written book students *ought* to love. Gurren Lagann, on the other hand, is like the Terry Pratchett book where most teachers would overlook some of the really sophisticated stuff being done because A: tons of people *do* love it and B: it's not taking itself nearly seriously enough for their taste.
>> ARTICLE
I think Haibane Renmei deserves at least an honorable mention, if not a top ten slot.
>> ARTICLE
That show is *intense*. And the music and art are both amazing; I love Yoshitoshi ABe's character designs, and Ootani Kou did a fantastic job with the soundtrack.

[Hell, just watch the opening and you'll see what I'm talking about.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wApAEg0ErgE)
>> ARTICLE
Really, *really* deserves a Top 10 spot. My favorite anime of all time, and definitely a ground-breaking series, as OP was judging them.
Seriously, I started this show on Christmas Eve a few years ago, and was *pissed off* that I had to leave and go get gifts at my grandparents' house halfway through.
>> ARTICLE
And [Blue Flow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoI8A3eemEM) still gives me chills down my spine just about every time I hear it.

Death Note is pretty good but everything after a certain significant event midway through the series really killed it for me. I'd put it in the top 50.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed.  If they would of stopped it at that point, would of been good, but they just keep dragging it.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, it died down after it happened. I unfortunately dropped it after that. Is it still worth watching to the end? (now that its finished)

I guess it is, just to know how it all works out... but it's just not the same. I kept expecting it to be undone and find out it was all a trick but.. nope.

Question is... Should lists like this include anime that hasn't been given localized releases yet? I admit that I saw fan subs of this recently (I'm normally a believer in concept IP if not the implementation) since I really doubt this series will ever be released in the States. I would vote yes for this series, if so... my vote would be for Planetes otherwise.

I think relic put some stuff that's not domestic yet.  I know School Days isn't.
>> ARTICLE
A decent enough list. I'll go with _Macross Frontier_, it was a lot of fun and bit nostalgic for us old geeks.  Two thumbs up for _Azumanga Daiou_ and _Mushishi_.  I would have listed _Honey and Clover_ and one of the _Full Metal Panic_ series. And of course _Chobits_. And would have moved _Black Lagoon_ up into the main list. And _Welcome to the NHK_ as well.

And finally, I had no problem with the second season of Haruhi, except of course that _Endless Eight_ was about 5 episodes too long...  
>> ARTICLE
Just some that I'd give an honourable mention to: Darker than Black, Genshiken, Haibane Renmei, Texhnolyze...  and I'd put Samurai Champloo in that top 10!
>> ARTICLE
Darker Than Black seems better to me than Cowboy Bebop... I would put that in a list like this.
>> ARTICLE
yeah i meniotned darker than black in my post. i am not feeling the second season as much as the first though
>> ARTICLE
Death Note would deserve a spot if the second arc didn't exist. For me, it seriously weighed down what was for a while a fairly strong and entertaining series.

No mention whatsoever of Makoto Shinkai? All of his movies are at least worthy of an honorable mention, if not a slot. Kino's Journey also should be somewhere on there.

>> ARTICLE
As far as movies go, I did [a separate list/submission for those](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/aet3c/my_opinion_on_the_top_ten_anime_movies_of_this/). Which did include 2 of Makoto Shinkai's movies. Voices of a distant star, and 5cm per second. It didn't get as well as a reception as this submission though.

I've never seen Kino's Journey, which is one of the few shows rated above an 8 on anidb I have yet to see. (I believe it's rated 8.69) I addressed the fantasy genre with 12 kingdoms (which has a rating of 8.68) so I'll have to check it out. 

If it's rated that high, it has to be a good watch. Thanks for the heads up.

The Full Metal Alchemist coming out in Japan right now has been pretty good, I think.  Like, really REALLY good.  Ok, I admit it... I'm in love.  It's the best anime I've seen in a while.
>> ARTICLE
Me too!  I've heard from my manga-reading friends that it's much closer to said manga.  Makes you wonder if the Japanese fans were Q_Q-ing over the vastly inferior first TV series when it came out.
>> ARTICLE
The first series was ok only because the manga had not developed that far yet. Now that the manga has developed, its story outdoes the first series by leaps and bounds.

Chapter 102 came out a few days ago and OMG, the surprises just kept coming!
>> ARTICLE
Even so, think of how long it took the first series to get to Hughes's death.  The pacing of the first series was still bad compared to the current one.

Also, you're gonna get me reading scanslations >_<.

At the time it was ok, but the manga's eventual development kicked the crap out of the first series.

It's his top 10. I don't get to watch quite as much anime as I'd like to, but I've seen enough that maybe my own top 10 is warranted.

Macross was just more fun than Gundam 00 since it wasn't as dark. Some episodes were but most were much lighter. It depends on the mood I'm in but both are very good. 
>> ARTICLE
Macross was fun but it felt way too formulatic.  I remember when /m/ would predict what would happen weeks before the episode occurs, and they were almost always right.  

The first Season of Gundam 00 though was so different and barrier breaking in my opinion.  It was political, very sci-fi, and acted as a metaphor for our current world situation.  S2 was back to the old "God Unit VS Grunts" deal though.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for bitching about Haruhi season 2....presenting it that way, I'll agree.

Deathnote was indeed good, but I still think the ending was a letdown. I enjoyed Bokurano more in the end.

I just finished reading the Nodame Cantabile manga (it ended 2 months ago IIRC), and it was wonderful. I LOVED it. It was what Nana tried too hard to do.

After Saikano, I don't think I can handle another WTF genre unless I stumble upon it by accident. It was indeed good though.

Everything else I haven't seen yet (except GITS and Lucky Star, which were both good) :( I'll definitely be tackling some of them, but some are outside of my taste for genres.

I really enjoyed Eureka Seven with the unique story and great music, but I sometimes feel like the only one. It's my only other recommendation (besides Bokurano....but that's cause I'm a fanboy nutcase for the series lol).

eden of the east - offbeat, but awesome. can't wait for the films

darker than black - i enjoyed the first season more than i do the second one. polished and great protagonist

spice and wolf - fantasy with some economics thrown in

I just say Gurren Lagann cause its easier to understand and shorter to type at 6 am. But there is only 1 version and thats the Japanese one, if you are wondering.

This is true. The Japanese version eclipses the English dub. Sorry, American actors, you didn't do that well this time. I tried watching the dub for about three minutes and nearly gagged.

I can't take seriously any top ten list that doesn't include FLCL, Ghost in the Shell: SAC, or Gurren Lagan. The first and last blow anything else out of the water.

If you call FLCL shallow, you haven't watched it enough. End of story. That show is so nuanced and touches so many genres, and has good music, story, and artwork to boot? The only people who'd discount it are those who can't see past the zaniness. That's your problem, not the show's.

Gurren Lagann does everything it set out to do, and it set the bar high. So few anime can claim that, it deserves a place. 

I will say the same thing that I do about Oscar snobs who don't think an action movie can be best picture: art is measured by its ability to deepen our own experiences of life. We are NOT just brains that can feel deep sorrow or love. We have bodies. We can feel movement and visceral experiences. We can laugh. **We can think and feel deeply about things OTHER than just what makes us sad or horny.** 

tl;dr, FLCL and Gurren Lagann stay on my list. And they're more than justified.

Higashi no Eden, Gundam 00. That's this year. I don't have extensive knowledge, but enough. Just because it was dubbed, does not make it worse. Just because it's popular, doesn't make it worse. And I'll have you know, I'm not coming at this from an "Is this a good anime?" angle; FLCL is one of the most fulfilling *experiences* I've ever had in front of a TV. 


FYI, the cancer killing **any** fandom are the niche snobs. Just so you know.


>> ARTICLE
> FYI, the cancer killing any fandom are the niche snobs. Just so you know.


Oh I completely agree. That's my point. You are the niche snob. Most here only have experienced english dubbed anime. Which is a **niche** in the world of anime.

95 percent of anime isn't dubbed. So to say you even have a valid opinion just watching Higashi no Eden and Gundam 00 this year is ignorant and snobbish, at the very least. I've seen around 20 shows that have aired this year alone. 

But keep thinking you're not the cancer... whatever floats your boat. 



>> ARTICLE
>Oh I completely agree. That's my point. You are the niche snob. Most here only have experienced english dubbed anime. Which is a niche in the world of anime.

You've... You've got to be kidding me. You're the one who turns your nose up at a titles because they're dubbed. I already said I watched subbed sho-... You know, this isn't even worth it. I'm just gonna downvote you and be done with it. Have a nice day.
>> ARTICLE
I never said I turned my nose up at titles because they're dubbed. 

You're not doing so hot at reading comprehension. I said if *you personally* only watch shows because they're dubbed, it will limit your viewing experience and thus your opinion will be shallow and pointless. 

It's like trying to be a wine taster, only ever have tasted red wine. Or a movie critic who has only seen comedies. You are therefor ignorant of the topic we are discussing, and in no position to have an opinion. 


But whatever... If your top ten list consists of beebop, pokemon, elfen lied, hellsing, dragonball z and trigun, that's your opinion. But my opinion holds that you have no clue what you are talking about. 

Ignorance is bliss so they say, who am I to ruin yours. Carry on.

>But whatever... If your top ten list consists of beebop, pokemon, elfen lied, hellsing, dragonball z and trigun, that's your opinion. But my opinion holds that you have no clue what you are talking about.

I never said that, *stop* putting words in my mouth.

Let's get a few things straight:

* Being dubbed and licensed does not mean a show isn't better than most of the shit out there. The reason shows are licensed? Because the licensers see a potential for a market. Often, why do they see a potential for a market? Because the show is fucking *good*. As a matter of fact, *several* times have I seen a dub that I felt much better than the sub (FLCL again), but that is besides the point: a dub is still, essentially, the same show as it was in Japan. To discount a show because it's been licensed is just beyond snobbery.

* **You** are the one who said you would not consider a show good because it was licensed. **I** said I watch both dubs and subs. **You** are the niche snob, because you would discount a show's merits based on a triviality. Test results say: **You are the cancer.**

* Beyond the philosophical arguments, you are also **literally** the cancer. American licensors are dropping like flies because of SOBs like you. "Oh, that's okay, I can still get my subs." Well, there's also the fact that the producers will have to drop their budgets because less money is coming in from the licensors. And the perks? Gone. No toys, no magazines (Newtype). Eventually, interest drops off because the *next* generation of anime fans aren't brought in by the licensed shows that introduces the mainstream to the genre. Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Sailor Moon, Gundam Wing, and for the older guys, Robotech, Voltron, etc: I will not comment on their quality, but I can assure you that these (licensed) shows were the gateway drug to 80-90%+ of all anime fans today. And without that influx of new eyes, ears, and dollars, the industry (and the conventions that are its social centers) is going to collapse. In short, people like you are killing the American industry. People like you **are the cancer.**

I'm not quite sure why I wrote all that, since you people never seem to learn, but ah well. Here's a protip: park it in front of the TV sometime, watch an Adult Swim airing of FLCL, and 1) be enlightened, and 2) Support the industry. Or you can just go back to hopping on the "Sub only" bandwagon... Until whatever you're watching gets licensed.

I have issues with several of your mentions. Rosario+Vampire is absolutely terrible and Macross Frontier is mediocre, at best.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I loved Macross F. Was a fun anime to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I can't see Macross Frontier as being much more than a fanboy gimmick. I watched it and didn't particularly enjoy it. There were several mecha anime that were far better in quality (and also had good music, per your opinion). Without addressing the cult statuses of both Gundam and Gurren Lagann, there are two other mecha anime that should have deserved a mention, even a passing one at that: RahXephon and Eureka Seven.
>> ARTICLE
As far as gimmicks go, check [out the concerts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNDuq-_AnRc&#t=6m54s). There are at least 20,000 people in that stadium. And they did multiple concerts which *all* sold out.

In fact, the recently released Macross F movie is number 7 in Japan's box office with standing room only in theaters right now, despite a very limited release. And it's been out for weeks. Macross F has most certainly achieved cult status in Japan. However, it's much, much newer than Gurren and most Gundam shows. Less than a year old, and no American licensees have bought the licenses to distribute yet. 

But newness, availability and/or popularity in the states shouldn't be a factor in deciding 'best anime of the decade'. I respect your opinion, but I agree with the OP on this. Macross F has a huge following and is far more popular than Gurren in Japan. Gundam is a different story though, it's a huge franchise. 


As far as RahXephon goes... I thought it was a failed ripoff of Evangelion, trying to profit off some of the tenants that made eva popular. Eureka Seven wasn't bad though. 
>> ARTICLE
Macross has always been very popular but that doesn't mean it's good. Naruto, Bleach, George W. Bush, and World of Warcraft were/are all popular at one point. 
>> ARTICLE
Haha, agreed. Also, Macross's music is WAAAAAAY better than Macross as a whole. I feel that people's love of the music leads them to forgive a lot of really flawed aspects of the show (I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong! But watching it didn't have any kind of impact on me).
>> ARTICLE
RahXephon I have not seen, but Eureka Seven was just amazing. It deserves to go here.
>> ARTICLE
RahXephon was extremely confusing.
>> ARTICLE
I am interested in hearing your opinions on why it surpasses Gurren.  Also, props for standing by your reasons.
>> ARTICLE
I think Gurren, Gundam and Macross F could all give each other a run for their money in terms of story line, production, character development and plot. All three are good shows. It's only my opinion, but I thought Macross F's animation was a tad better than all three (Especially in HD). But what really sets Macross F apart was it's music. It was an integral part of the show and done very well. Done so well in fact, that they sold out huge concerts having the VA's sing the songs from the show. 

Basically, it added an element that Gurren nor Gundam doesn't have. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree that Macross's music is superb in quality and quantity, but Gurren Lagann's music is also high quality... and while it is not high quantity, I feel the perfection in capturing the spirit of the series and the uniqueness of "Libera me" mean that it cannot be discounted in this category. You can say Macross's was better, certainly.

That being said, can you really say Macross was equal to TTGL in characters or story? Macross was really rather... wishy washy and bland in those areas I felt. It also took a cop-out with the ending... they set up this drama the whole series trying to keep you guessing which singing girl the main guy will choose and then they decide not to resolve that in any way. 

Yeah, the songs were great, but they didn't really colorize the somewhat bland characters that much, and they didn't actually improve a rather mediocre storyline.

I enjoyed Macross, and I really loved the music as well, but I feel you're letting your love for the music override your critical analysis of the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Gurren was a bad show at all. In fact, I thought it was a great show. Which is why I mentioned it my honorable mentions.

But I also said my list was based on shows that broke the mold, raised the bar, or were game changers.

Did Gurren, as part of the mecha genre do that? Perhaps. Compared to an anime like Evangelion? No. In my opinion, it didn't break any molds. However, Macross F did. Macross F might be similar to Gurren and thus less superior then Eva as far as story telling and plot goes, but it did break a mold. It broke the music mold for it's genre


And on [an epic scale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YDLN9xfRik). I think a lot of non-japanese don't realize how popular Macross F's music became.

It's opinion based, but to me, the only other show that surpasses it as far as music goes, is Nodame Cantabile. And that's a show based completely on music.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh... so, essentially, you are not trying to make a "best" list, you're trying to make a "most impact on the art form of anime" list?

Your choices make a lot more sense then... They seemed sort of... Oh, I don't know. Professorial? Academic? But you're essentially using the same standards as the academic English world does when choosing books to teach in classes.

Now, I don't necessarily agree that the criteria they (or you) use equate to "best" but if you're not trying to make a "best" list I feel I have much less argument with your choices.
>> ARTICLE
> you're trying to make a "most impact on the art form of anime" list?

Yes, exactly. Maybe I should have been more clear in my submission. I apologize. :P

If I made a different list, maybe with my own personal favorites, Gurren would definitely be on there. I just kinda wanted to go against the grain a bit and perhaps try to draw attention to good/great shows that people haven't seen yet, or perhaps might never see.
>> ARTICLE
It was terrible at the start and the endless fan service was a major annoyance.

And really a shame since I actually liked a lot of the Rosario manga. It's like they took the worst elements when they made the anime, and tossed out the good parts to make a generic harem show.

Agree with almost all of your choices. I'm glad to finally see some experienced anime watchers on reddit rather than the "0mg cowboybebop is amzing!!"
>> ARTICLE
Though, it makes sense because Cowboy Bebop is amazing. Being mainstream doesn't make it any less so.
>> ARTICLE
it's only amazing compared to anime introduced in the United States... In Japan it's only mildly popular. It didn't even make [Asahi's Top 100 anime list](http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/anime100/) (for those that can't read Japanese, try searching for ****)

Anyway, my point is that a lot of mainstream American anime like Cowboy Bebop and Trigun are highly over-rated when compared to other anime that's relatively unknown in the West.
>> ARTICLE
The heavy censorship and blockade of Cowboy Bebop in Japan played a huge part on its popularity.
>> ARTICLE
Look I think a big reason that Bebop did so well is that it resonates well with the American style of fiction telling.  The vagabonds looking to make their way in the world, in a wild west type setting is a very American setting, even though it was Japanese production. So I think it's totally appropriate for the japanese to have different taste. 
>> ARTICLE
>vagabonds looking to make their way in the world, in a wild west type setting

Explain [Baccano!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccano!) then, which fits your description to a T and is a much better anime than Cowboy Bebop (imho), yet I'm betting half the people here have never watched it
>> ARTICLE
I did watch it. I do believe Baccano is good, but the characters (besides that chick and the dude that wore the cowboy hat) were forgettable.
>> ARTICLE
Reading your description it's not Wild west, but I'm going to be checking it out.  

BTW I was not saying the bebop was the end all.  I was just saying it had powerful resonance for that reason.  Also Baccano! probably hasn't had the distribution that Bebop had. 

Ciao  
>> ARTICLE
I don't think popular equals good. Cowboy Bebop and Trigun have a lot of attention and media coverage in the anime world but it doesn't mean its over-rated. If you want to talk about over-rated, look at the Gundam series.
>> ARTICLE
did you even look at that list? DBZ is number 2. Popular in japan != good
>> ARTICLE
Are you referring to the original DBZ or the sack of crap that was the Funimation dub?

Because the Toei Animation version still holds its ground today, and I'm even watching the re-released version Dragon Ball Z Kai (even though I've watched all the original Japanese episodes). There was a certain charm that the dub just couldn't carry over (not to mention somehow editing out [entire characters](http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Launch))

Despite American grumblings, the series is entertaining... Afterall, there's a reason Dragonball characters are still featured on Asian products 25 years after the original manga was released. To paraphrase this_barb, being mainstream doesn't make it less awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen the dubbed version so what do I know, but I would never put DBZ as my second favorite anime.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. Dragonball and DBZ were fantastic before they were butchered by funimation. I was lucky enough to watch both shows as they aired in the early 90's. (DBZ anyhow, the original draganball began airing in the late 80's)

I tried watching an episode of dragonball Z on the cartoon network and yeah... It was definitely dubbed for little kids. Most horrific thing I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Eureka 7 - When you realize there are multiple main characters, it becomes quite awesome.

Now and Then, Here and There - It is on the last legs of the decade, but I believe this show really explored some harsh topics.

Black Lagoon - Just for the absurb (awesome) fights.

It could cost more for the rights there than what its worth, or maybe they have trouble getting subs out for that language, or someone else could have outbid them for the streaming rights (i cant access peppermint or vvvvid to see if they have those series instead, but its possible)

Hmm, wonder if Digimon will end up anywhere.

AssClass is 22 episodes long, there should be a new episode tommorow.

ohhhh ok, that makes much more sense. Thanks.

No clue. Funi seems to have a few shows every season that have a delayed premiere for whatever reason.

Saint Seiya Soul Of Gold - Daisuke | Crunchyroll (United States, Canada, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, South America, Central America & Caribbean)


YES!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Thanks for this list! I found a couple more streaming sites I've never heard of before, are there any more you didn't list? I put links together mainly for /r/animesuggest so it would be cool to know all of them.
>> ARTICLE
i've listed all the ones i know of. Europe is tough to keep track of with all the different languages/local licensors, and some of the sites i cant access myself to see what they have (region blocks on content etc)

So chances are there are a bunch more, but if you do find any please let me know and i'll add them!
>> ARTICLE
Oh, and three more things:

1. Daisuk*i*, not Daisuk*e*

2. I can't find 'Yamato Animation' anywhere, can you link me to the site?

3. Just to make sure, I want to compare my list to see if I'm missing any that you have:

Aniplex, Crunchyroll, Daisuki, Funimation, Hulu, Netflix, Viewster, Youtube, ADN (AnimeDigitalNetwork), Animelab, Anime-on-Demand, Hanabee, Peppermint, VVVVID, Wakanim.


>> ARTICLE
1. thats awfully embarrassing. oops. 

2. [youtube channel] (https://www.youtube.com/user/YamatoEntertainment/about),  i *think* they're a part of [Yamato Video] (http://www.yamatovideo.com/default.asp), but if anyone from Italy could elaborate that'd be great. 

3. i think you're missing Animax UK, but they rarely have anything afaik
>> ARTICLE
Huh, never heard of Animax. Thanks for that! I'll look at Yamato's channel, and don't worry about it. I think the actual Japanese word is spelled with an e instead of an I. Maybe not though, it sounds like the word 'ski' at the end.
>> ARTICLE
no no its definitely "suki", for some reason i've just always spelt the streaming site differently - even though the website is "Daisuki.net" >.<
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that nothing on your list has 'Amazon Prime' listed, but I think that might just be because there is no shows this season that are on Amazon Prime :p 

Other than that, you have all the ones I usually link to. I'm adding all the other ones to my links as well, thanks! :)
>> ARTICLE
In all honesty I had no idea amazon prime did simulcasts at all lol, but thats good to know! I'll have to look into it. Thanks again!
>> ARTICLE
I'm honestly not sure if they do any simulcasts at all, but it is a streaming service and I thought I would mention it. Also, no problem! :)
>> ARTICLE
Alright, thanks! I'll let you know! :)

I am seriously starting to understand why so many of my European friends download.... Seriously, without Hola I couldn't even see Fate/Stay Night... Funimation apparently have absolutely nothing they think I should see.
>> ARTICLE
where are you from specifically? fate is available [almost everywhere] (http://www.fate-sn.com/onair/)

Funimation are a US licensor, they have no reason to air things outside the US. Its up to your local licensors to bring you those series

>> ARTICLE
Denmark. We get nothing if it isn't more or less all of Europe getting it.

Edit: And I'm not sure we really have any local distributor in Denmark. 4Kids used to have a partner here, but that is a long time ago and, you know, only really pokemon/digimon. Naruto have run at some point as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Aw, no Nanoha? I hope someone picks up the rights and releases the shows in America. I love the first two, and have watched about 1/2 of StrikerS. I bought some DVDs that are totally legal in Malaysia and it's  hard (but kind of funny) to figure out what the Engrish subs are saying. And it's all in stunning 2007-era YouTube quality!
>> ARTICLE
With the exception of *Dungeon* ^and ^*Fate* , everything I'm watching this season is on Funi... Lot of good that Crunchyroll subscription is doing me right now...

EDIT - Okay, I lied... I forgot about *Fate/stay night: UBW.*
>> ARTICLE
Just Gintama for me. I'll probably check out Plastic Memories and maybe some other ones but nothing as good as the ones on Funi.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest CR gets a lot of....well, mediocre anime per season. Now, don't get me wrong, They also get a lot of awesome stuff also. So they usually come up even or have a little bit more than Funi. 
>> ARTICLE
Usually, but not this time... *Arslan Senki,* *Kekkai Sensen,* *Owari no Seraph* - the shows I'm most interested in this season - are all on Funi
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I'm only really interested in about 2 or 3 shows on CR this season.
>> ARTICLE
So true about the mediocre shows on CR, especially the past few seasons they only get a couple of good ones and the rest is crap
>> ARTICLE
Check out My love Story/OreMono, it's probably the best one I've seen this season. Although admittedly I like shoujo shows, so YMMV.
>> ARTICLE
Do you watch old shows with it too?
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes, but those you can watch without subscription unless I'm mistaken...
>> ARTICLE
True, but the ads can be annoying.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, and you can watch in higher quality with a subscription, too.
>> ARTICLE
Durarara has like 60 some odd episodes with Shou, Ten, and Ketsu.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of shows do.  I crammed in as many episodes as I could to stay under 40, but still give the show an appropriate rating for the content.  Mushi-Shi's entry also doesn't have the full amount of stuff, but that's the point.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, it would be better if you filtered them out as well. Makes no sense for people who search for short shows to watch only half the series just because it is divided by more seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass has 50 eps, Bakuman has 75eps, Major has like 129 episodes, Monogatari has ~83, Clannad has 47, Ghost in the Shell SAC is 52+2hr movie, JoJo is 79 episodes and counting (will be 115 by time Part 4 ends).

Hellsing Ultimate is more like 30 episodes with its 1 hour runtime, same with Katanagatari and 24 eps.

> Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, Gintama, HxH, FMA:BH, Monster, DBZ, Bakuman, Code Geass, Durarara are among my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Did you read the rules I used for the list?

Half the point of the list was to remove second seasons of things from the top, because they require the time investment.  If the first season still does well then it's in the list because it's standalone, which second seasons are not.  
>> ARTICLE
But then, why would you include second seasons for some shows but not others? At the point, the 40 episode thing becomes a very arbitrary guideline.
>> ARTICLE
You're not even following your own rules m8
>> ARTICLE
> Rule 1: No anime longer than 40 episodes. Period.

Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show. 
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show.

I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point.  If people want to continue after that, that's their decision, but all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.  But that's ok.  I'm going to remake the list taking into account all this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point. If people want to continue after that, that's their decision,

truly, if this is your interpretation of your rules then your list doesn't make any sense. Everybody can continue or stop after ~40 episodes of anything (first season or not), they don't need your misguided list for that.

>  all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.

> Code Geass, Attack on Titan, Chihayafuru on the list

ok, so what you do is claiming it's enough to call something a 'first season' to make it stand alone. Because these three very clearly don't have any resolution in the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Well is certainly my fault for not explaining the purpose well.  The overarching goal was to remove incredibly long running shows, but more importantly to remove sequel bias within the context of show length.  So all these shows that are not only long, but also contain a huge score jump in the second season tend to dominate the list quite a bit. A guy a while ago made a combined season list which averaged scores, and that was awesome, but didn't necessarily remove what I feel is the heavy score bias from familiarity that plagues the top 100.   But anyway, is a moot point now. Intentions are meaningless. 
>> ARTICLE
Also Chihayafuru, Haikyuu, Mushishi, Kurono Basket, xxxHolic, Initial D, Yomamushi Pedal, Kingdom, Nodame Cantabile, Kaiji, Magi and Natsume Yuujinchouu.
>> ARTICLE
> If they rely on knowledge from previous shows, they're out. Gundam would be a good example - Gundam 00 might be fantastic (might be a bad example, I know nothing ab Gundam 00 *is* standalone. 

Gundam 00 is standalone and requires no knowledge of UC. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, figured something like that might happen.  Sorry Gundam.
>> ARTICLE
> Moribito Guardian of the Stuff

I'll admit I did chuckle a bit.
>> ARTICLE
>Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, absolutely. Except for Hyouka, all of my top 5 shows have more than 50 episodes. I also freaking love JJBA, One Piece and a lot more.

I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

Longer shows have a better chance to properly explore the setting and the characters and you can get easier attached to them as well. I also prefer slower pacing way more than to fast pacing, but that's just me.

Anyways, thanks for the work.

> I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

I was having a discussion with a buddy of mine about this.  We've both read the Wheel of Time series, which is good, but a massive time investment.  There are a lot of good, long running shows and if I'd started them at the time it would be fine, but trying to jump in now...not sure it's worth the time.
>> ARTICLE
When i was new to anime, i was actually sad that there were so few long shows. I was in Post Anime Depression after FMA:B was my first proper anime(that i knew was anime and intentionally sought out), worse was it after doing HxH up to the airing episode (119 iirc.) in a week. Felt like i'd never find anything like them again, and i really haven't had a lot anime past that point be either. So long ones are good, as long as you don't get stuck in Naruto/Bleach fillers. Skip those if they don't please you, that's what i do. 

HxH probably has the best pacing imo. (Chimera arc exempt, that one was a bit slower IIRC.) To me, the first 20 episodes felt like 50, and in a positive way. For some reason, the 2 minute episode situation that a lot of good shows have didn't happen in HxH, though i'm not sure why. It's wasn't a bad thing, i enjoyed those long good paced episodes because they felt so filled. 

As a side note, to me, HxH was great from the beginning, so i understand that for those that didn't like it as much at the beginning, might have felt different about this. 
>> ARTICLE
Cool list! I'll have to get around to watching Rakugo sometime...

On a side note though, Gundam 00 is standalone. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the other series.
>> ARTICLE
This is super helpful.  
Nice job! MAL should try and sort out their shitty list formats too.  

>> ARTICLE
Why not Bake + Nise + Neko?
>> ARTICLE
Higurashi (when they cry) has a second season which pushes it to 50 episodes total. (+ several ovas, 6 of which counts as a third season)  
  
I guess you can see the first season only, but 90% of the plot of the first season is explained in the second season. It's a bit weird to only include the first season on the list, since the story doesn't make much sense without the second season to back it up. 

If I was to pick anime from a list like this, I would rather have all the shows included be 40 or less, including all relevant sequels. If I want a short anime, I don't want to discover later that there are actually two more seasons that weren't listed just to keep the episode count down. 

That's just my opinion though!  
[Good job](#bestiathumbsup)
>> ARTICLE
Ha, fear not!  I'm remaking the list so there are no shows at all that go over 26 episodes!
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! 
>> ARTICLE
YLiA #2, OPM #3, Code Geass #4. 

I am not an anti-circlejerker against YLiA or OPM (I hate Code Geass), in fact I enjoyed both for the most part. But putting them into top 5? Hah, nope. It is actually sad to see how Ping Pong and TTGL lower than them. And by god, Berserk and Tatami Galaxy are low.
>> ARTICLE
This list really saves me the trouble of watching the top stuff while having to sift through the long runners. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I never realised how many long Anime there are in the top 100 before seeing that just removing the 40+ ones moves Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso from #14 to #2. That makes me happy.

EDIT: Also I never would have guessed to see Shokugeki no Souma that high, it's great and I don't disagree with it, I just never would have expected it to.

The fact that CG is higher on this list than CB causes my joints to hurt.

Fight scene: Fate/UBW [Saber (+Archer) Vs. Berserker] (/spoiler)

Studio: Madhouse because they've been so consistent. Everything they've done this year has looked gorgeous and been amazing. I'm ignoring Mahou Sensou. Shut up. It didn't happen.

Best First Episode: This one is hard, but I'll say Zankyou no Terror

Best Last Episode: Barakamon. I cried even though it was happy.

Best Original Anime: Zankyou no Terror.

Best Fight Scene - [F/SN Spoiler](/s "Shirou vs Kazuki") I didn't like F/SN all that much, but everything about that scene was badass. Besides [Spoiler](/s "the fact that it was a convenient power up")

Best Studio - KyoAni. Everything they put out this year looked fantastic.

Best First Episode - Tokyo Ghoul. I was calling the show as AOTS after that first episode. The episode was filled with so much emotion and the execution of it was great.

Best Last Episode - Ping Pong. It wrapped everything up beautifully and was really touching. 

Best Original Anime - I don't give a fuck what everyone else says, Zankyou no Terror was very well done.

Best Art Style - Kill la Kill. I would have gone for Shigatsu, but it's a bit too over saturated for my taste.

**Best Fight Scene - Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works prologue** (I had a hard time deciding between this, HxH ep 131 and the NGNL one but this was the first time we saw the breathtaking animation of F/sn and recalling my reaction to seeing that the first time I couldn't justify not picking this.)

**Best Studio - Madhouse** (I think Shaft is a worthy winner as well but Madhouse one upped them this time, I'll flip my shit if Tatsunoko wins though.)

**Best First Episode - Aldnoah.Zero** (Honestly all five of them were amazing but A.Z got me hyped like nothing else this year, albeit I was very disappointed later on, close second too Zankyou no Terror.)

**Best Last Episode - Hunter x Hunter (2011)** (I feel like this is gonna be a matchup between HxH and Ping Pong for first place, in my own opinion HxH was the best albeit the last couple of episodes before the last one was somewhat disappointing.)

**Best Original Anime - Shirobako** (I really liked Shirobako and I think it's deserving of this one, Bahamut will most likely win though which would be my second pick so I am alright with that.)

**Best Artstyle - Nisekoi** (Woo my nominee Glasslip made it through! That being said though no matter that I really like it's artstyle as I find it to be 3rd of these, it was a toss-up between Nisekoi and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso for me but I ended up with Nisekoi because of the well made transitions into the more ["comedy based" art style](http://i.imgur.com/A0jPpO0.gif) which it's known for and the high standard the normal art style had.
