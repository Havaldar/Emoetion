oh man, that first Jirocho fight always gets me hyped, and i've watched it countless times

the Four Devas arc is the best in Gintama anime so far imo
>> ARTICLE
BEST ARC IN THE HISTORY OF ANIME HANDS DOWN
>> ARTICLE
> the Four Devas arc is the best in Gintama anime so far imo


Fuck yea it is, that arc was brilliantly handled; and that ending, holy fuck that ending, I tear up everytime I watch it. 



Also, this arc is the reason why I always use Jirocho as my IGN in MMORPGs.
>> ARTICLE
The music, the sound effects, the animation and the dialogue are amazing. 

I still get goosebumps when I hear [that song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsSTM1-SeKU)
>> ARTICLE
It gives me this visceral feeling like im about to throw up but then just hype comes out
>> ARTICLE
I uploaded the 4 Devas arc with live voice acting on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84II5z_TqzE

Enjoy! It's really awesome. The crowd went nuts when Jirocho had his entrance. Notice that the crowd is 99% female lol. The last scene was incredible too.
>> ARTICLE
Do you still have it somewhere? It got removed

It was a cut from Gintama matsuri 2011, I upload all 3 Gintama festivals here:

It cracked me up seeing that Shinpachi's VA wears glasses too
>> ARTICLE
He is basically real-life Shinpachi lol
>> ARTICLE
gintama has a huge female audience. 
>> ARTICLE
everyone knows the japanese women are the ones with actual taste lmao
>> ARTICLE
Because they don't like shitty harems like the males do.
>> ARTICLE
They are basically the ones responsible for keeping this whole franchise alive. Japanese girls have awesome taste.

Explains why Gintoki won best anime husband award. Greatest husbando confirmed.

Goodbye sped up and higher pitched youtube videos. Welcome HD Gintama fights.

>> ARTICLE
*Brofist* Yes, I tried to have these in high quality uploaded. Feel free to use these to share the love.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite fight so far is Gintoki vs Oboro during Courtesan of a Nation

The combination of showing a bit of Gintoki's backstory with Yoshida-sensei and Oboro + Gintoki's raging anger for Oboro + excellent animation and soundtrack made their fight currently one of my favorite fights ever

Not only was it badass but you can feel the extreme emotion Gintoki was expressing during the fight
>> ARTICLE
Gintoki vs Oboro definitely ranks among the top for me too. Everything about this arc is exceptionally good. Loved the tragic love story behind it.

>> ARTICLE
I started Gintama recently so I have up to the fight with Tsukuyo's master Jiraia. So far Gintama has a slow start, but damn did it get good fast. Also, when should I watch the first movie? After the first season?
>> ARTICLE
The first movie covers the same story as the Benizakura arc, it's up to you if you want to watch it. It has polished HD visuals and a few more scenes added.

I think you can actually watch the 2nd movie already.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm almost at the end of the first season (currently on episode 200). I'm planning to watch the first movie once I finish the first season and the 2nd movie after the second season. At least that's the order I was told to watch them. Also, I just finished the Ketsuno Ana arc and this is probably the arc that had me laughing the most. 
>> ARTICLE
Rejoice the glorious switch to HD! It only gets better from here!

> the 2nd movie after the second season

Sounds like a good plan to me. Should be good.
>> ARTICLE
I'd probably watch the 2nd movie after Enchousen (so after like episode 265ish), only because that's how it was released. Unless that's what you meant and you were just combining Gintama' and Enchousen together.

Doesn't really matter much so your plan sounds good.
>> ARTICLE
I was combining them. That was where I was planning to watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn! Kagura vs Abuto always gets me.
>> ARTICLE
Good job!:)

However there's a few missing:

Mutsuba arc

Rokkaku arc

Shinsengumi Crisis

Shinigami arc

Kaientai arc

Also best fight for me is the second Jiraia vs Gintoki fight. The black and white part was absolutely mind boggling 
>> ARTICLE
But still without the comedy Gintama isn't Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
I wanted to show the best fights of this show. You listed some great arcs, but not sure if they had great extended fights. I tried to find scenes with longer length, which are are also not interrupted in the middle by cut scenes. I will still look into them though, thanks.

> Also best fight for me is the second Jiraia vs Gintoki fight. The black and white part was absolutely mind boggling

Yes, so fucking awesome!
>> ARTICLE
I'd say Hijikata totally owning that group of criminals was pretty badass and was average length

Obviously in the Shinsengumi Crisis arc there is the major Banzai vs Gintoki fight

Other than that I guess you're right, but I'd give the arcs a mention just to say these are serious as well (even without lots of fights)
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I missed Banzai vs Gintoki and added it now, thanks man. My video software has trouble with dealing with EP87, so I have to find another release of it. 
>> ARTICLE
I just realised another major fight is Obi Hajime vs Gintoki. That's actually another one of my favourites
>> ARTICLE
Added a short Obi Hajime vs Gintoki scene. The end of this stretches far too much.
>> ARTICLE
I actually already tried to add this to a have epic beamsaber fight included, but the cutscenes are kinda awkward. I might try it again.
>> ARTICLE
I recall the Hijikata vs Sasaki fight in Baragaki to be pretty cool too. Plus you could extend the Sougo/Nobume fight to when the building collapsed. Other than that, this is really great work :D Please continue making these when we get the animated fights coming soon.
>> ARTICLE
Hijikata vs Sasaki was great, but it has also some really annoying cut scenes in between the full fight. I really need to learn how cut and paste video-files together for this. It would end up as either tad too short or too long otherwise.

> Other than that, this is really great work :D Please continue making these when we get the animated fights coming soon.

Thanks! I am planning to!
>> ARTICLE
you are one of the few people that i have seen saying that the gin vs jiraia is their favourite fight and i agree.

That black and white shit was so refreshing to see, it was awesome
>> ARTICLE
Gintoki and Zura teaming up is hands down my favorite anime scene, the animation, the music, and the first time getting a glimpse of how badass the two are make it perfect.
>> ARTICLE
I'm getting so close to the Benizakura movie, I'm excited. 
>> ARTICLE
what is funny is that its not even the best gintama arc, one of the worst actually and its still good
>> ARTICLE
The Benizakura movie has better animation than the original 3 episode arc but I still prefer the 3 episode arc due to hearing Shura at the end of each episode

Pumps me up everytime
>> ARTICLE
The Benizakura arc is the introduction to the serious side of this series. It's quite good, but still far from the peak of this show. I hope you enjoy it! You will like the later arcs even more.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, the Benizakura arc is the arc mentioned most by Gintama fans who try to promote the series to newcomers. However, I don't want people to think that means this arc is the pinnacle of Gintama. It's mostly just an introduction to the fact that there is a really serious side to the story and there is an overarching plot, but it's far from the best the series has to offer. The real reason it's mentioned so much is because it's pretty much the first benchmark you should reach before you'll truly know whether you like the series or not. 
>> ARTICLE
When I first hit Benizakura (went in blind so had no idea it could go serious like that even though I knew it was not all comedy...) it was goddamn beautiful. Then the next serious arc completely topped that, and the next one would top the previous one... now I too can say that Benizakura is probably the most underwhelming one in hindsight (but I still love it a lot, esp since it has Serious Zura :'D)
>> ARTICLE
Nup, it's one of the best if you know the backstory that was revealed in the Shogun X arc. It has sooooooo much foreshadowing, it's ridiculous 
>> ARTICLE
Made me look at this series with a different perspective. The Gorilla is a god.
>> ARTICLE
dude i was on the other threads discussing the trailer and now you got me even more hyped, fuck everyone stop it :D
>> ARTICLE
Nothing can stop the Yorozuya hype train anymore!
>> ARTICLE
That Gintoku + Katsura vs amanto fight. i just realise how many time Gin change his weapon in that fight. the guy that create that scene is truly a genius!
>> ARTICLE
He goes full Gilgamesh in that scene xD
>> ARTICLE

[Noice](#helmetbro)

I actually have this version of the Benizakura fight [here](https://my.mixtape.moe/snybxp.webm) with slightly different typesetting for the karaoke. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I had this release too, but the webm program bugged when I used it. The karaoke typesetting really looks pretty in this.
>> ARTICLE
When Gintama gets serious is when it's at its best. It's why I rated the show a 10, not because of the humor.
>> ARTICLE
Then you will love the the new upcoming arc, it may be the best serious arc we have ever had in Gintama and is on-going for over a year now in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I heard! The hype is real :)
>> ARTICLE
but what about kaguras boyfriend arc, or her idol arc or the love potion arc D: I mean I am hyped for the new story arc, but the comedy arcs are also great. 
>> ARTICLE
I never said they were bad, I just enjoy the serious stuff more!
>> ARTICLE
In my case i came for the comedy, stayed for the story
>> ARTICLE
Not exactly a serious moment but there was also the fight scene during the Afro arc which looked pretty awesome
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched this episode yet :/
>> ARTICLE
Where are you up to?
>> ARTICLE
Gonna binge-watch it later :D
>> ARTICLE
This is a nice collection of the great fight scenes in Gintama! For a series that seems loose on actual action in the beginning, Gintama has some of the most awesome fights! I like the fight between Gintoki and Jirocho, it is an epic fight of pride.
>> ARTICLE
good job, you are only getting me more hyped for the next arc and its still not here :(

By what manga readers its the best gintama arc so, at least for me it will probably mean it will be the best arc i have ever seen or at least tied with the golden age arc from berserk
>> ARTICLE
I loved the shogun x arc, the upcoming one, I'm not sure if it's my favorite yet since I need to see the animation for it
>> ARTICLE
Nvm, the anime officially named the new arc Shogun Assassination Arc in the new trailer. There is nothing to hide anymore.
>> ARTICLE
nvm saw it
>> ARTICLE
Link to the trailer?
>> ARTICLE
Too bad they called it that way already

As someone who got spoiled by Google Images searching for Gintama stuff, I knew about Shogun Assassination arc pretty early although I didn't read the entire spoilers

Still hyped for what might happen during the arc tho
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga and I am hyped as fuck. Reading Gintama and watching it are 2 completely different things.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the atmosphere, soundtrack and animation really makes increases the experience

Add the upcoming arc to the current awesome ED and it will probably be really fun to watch it
>> ARTICLE
The name itself is a spoiler, people call it Shogun arc or Shogun x arc now. I would be careful with this.
>> ARTICLE
It's has a long length, involves all major characters and reveals some epic background story. Yeah, this arc is quite nice.
>> ARTICLE
i think i got a bit spoiled by youtube videos, stupid thumbnails
>> ARTICLE
Damn, but it shouldn't really matter. Watching it adapted will still be awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Man re-watching some of these scenes gave me goosebumps. Thanks for making this post.
>> ARTICLE
Glad that you liked it!
>> ARTICLE
So much hype for the upcoming Shogun Assassination Arc - by far the most serious arc so far!
>> ARTICLE
Yes, and they just released a epic new trailer!
>> ARTICLE
I love Gintama's serious arcs. And the trailer for [Shogun X arc](https://my.mixtape.moe/dslrnq.webm) is glorious. Takasugi's face is so damn beautiful, I can't get enough.
>> ARTICLE
Simply glorious. Nice work!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks man! Glad that you like it.
>> ARTICLE
Its always nice when someone else pitches in as well. Seems to be only I who is spreading the word of Gintama these days.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah good job! There used a lot of Gintama hype here a few months ago before this season started. The hype train is running up again with the new arc now!
>> ARTICLE
Missing a lot of the minor fights though. There's mean a nice number of fights prior to that final confrontation with Nizou. I mean, they aren't that amazing but it'd be nice to be able to see that evolution of fight scenes.
>> ARTICLE
I initially wanted only the best fights scenes of the series, but people's suggestion made me add more and more. Might as well add those from earlier episodes. 

Feel free to message me suggestions which fight from the exact episode number I should include.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the best, but I really like Hijikata's fight in the Yagyu Arc as well. First time they really developed that Shinsengumi backstory that heavily as well I believe. Off the top of my head that's currently the only one I can think of aside from the older ones prior to Benizakura. Oh actually there's the first fight with Nizou in Benizakura lol.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I will look into it. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Wait this show actually has a plot and point? I thought it was just twenty minutes of parody

Kinda like south park for Japan
>> ARTICLE
It has a bit of everything, though still more comedy than the rest. The melodrama being juxtaposed against the comedy episodes can hit seriously hard.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah about evry 40 episodes there is a really serious arc built in(they get more frequent the longer the show goes on). And the arc the anime is about to adapt will probably blow most of the other shonen arcs out of the water.(But just watching the serious episodes is still a shitty idea)
>> ARTICLE
Yes it actually does! Try clicking on some of these videos and you will see, it's getting incredibly intense man. 

The story spans out over the course of the entire series and are, believe it or not, loosely connected. The connection is often only seen in retrospect.

>> ARTICLE
The Housen fight is really good, can you upload the other parts of it?

Also, getting all the OPs and EDs wouldn't suck lmao. 
>> ARTICLE
Housen fight against Kamui or Gintoki?
>> ARTICLE
Gintoki
>> ARTICLE
Added it, hope you like it.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! You didn't add the end bit after the fight, but it's alright. Some of the best lines from Gintama are from right after a fight. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I wanted to avoid as many spoilers as possible, this thread is mainly about the fight scenes after all. And the rest of his lines would as long as the whole episode ;D
>> ARTICLE
Ah alright! Are any of the fights freezing for you? The first four divas fight did for me :I might be because I'm on mobile tho. 
>> ARTICLE
No freeze, the filesize aren't that small. Might be your mobile connection. Let me now if it freezes with your pc.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's just Android being Android. I don't really go on my PC that often haha. 
>> ARTICLE
I love you. It's hard to find on youtube so this is perfect. 
>> ARTICLE
Gintoki vs. Jirocho is my favorite moment in all of anime. My jaw was planted firmly on the floor during that entire scene. Holy shit just talking about gives me goosebumps.

Kagura vs. Abuto gets an honorable mention but nothing beats the buildup and release of the 4 devas arc
>> ARTICLE
Gintoki vs. Jirocho is one of the most intense anime fights ever. I re-watched it a lot of times already. Btw check out the live version I posted earlier, it's amazing as well. Jirocho's VA is a boss.
>> ARTICLE
This list is pretty comprehensive, but what about the fights in the yagyu arc?
>> ARTICLE
I looked into it, but it wasn't exactly as serious as the other fights posted here. Dunno maybe I will add it regardless.
>> ARTICLE
Is it weird that I found the "gintoki vs ????" really funny? 
thanks for posting and compiling these. really appreciate it :) 
>> ARTICLE
Hah you are the first to mention this one, yeah I thought it might too big of a spoiler. No problem!
>> ARTICLE
oh sick so you're still updating huh
>> ARTICLE
Of course, the best fight scenes are still to be added ;D
>> ARTICLE
A bit late here, but I've always thought Shinpachi vs Obi one was one of the most emotional fights of the series even though it didn't have much action
>> ARTICLE
I remember the cuts of this fight were kinda weird, I will rewatch it and maybe add it to the list, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
[I think this would be a better gif to use for gin vs takasugi since it has all battle scenes](http://icy-sparkle.tumblr.com/post/136772802011/gintoki-vs-takasugi-battle-cut-only)
>> ARTICLE
This is a great cut, I wish it had a higher resolution. I will convert it as webm and add it. Thanks!

 Maybe I will try make my own version later on. 
>> ARTICLE
Add the shinigami arc fight?
>> ARTICLE
I looked into it and it was hardly a fight. It would be difficult to find a good scene to add.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to ask, but any chance we could get that latest Gintoki VS Utsuro fight? I'm thinking from the bit where Gintoki charges down the wall would be awesome. Thanks if you can, no worries if not!
>> ARTICLE
I will!
>> ARTICLE
Are you gonna update this list with Utsuro vs Nobume/Kagura/Okita and Gintoki vs Utsuro?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I will update this thread until this series ends. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks a lot! Sure brings back memories.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is a comedy not a battle series, it has battle arcs and plot sprinkled inbetween but if you don't like comedy DON'T watch it

Also, out of context, these fights aren't as good as all. My personal favorite is that Jiraiya black and white one 
>> ARTICLE
The new arc disagrees with you ;D jk, you are right. 
>> ARTICLE
I have to watch 140 episodes before a good fight? 

I'm not sure this show is for me. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more an episodic comedy anime than a serious shounen. 
I like it and I'm halfway through the first season. But to me it's way too overrated. 
>> ARTICLE
Keep on watching every gintama fan agrees that it gets better.EVERYONE
>> ARTICLE
> I like it and I'm halfway through the first season.

At which episode are you at exactly? I recommend you to continue, your opinion might change :D
>> ARTICLE
The more you watch the more you realize that it's not episodic. 


 It has an overarching plot and standalone episodes.  
>> ARTICLE
If you're only looking for the action part then you're indeed in the wrong show. Part of why Gintama is so good is because how it managed to mix and shift between the comedy and the serious-action part. It's really funny when it comes to the comedy and shit got really real when it goes serious. Though if you're really just want to watch the best part of it, you can always take the shortcut: watch the first 25 episode for the characters introduction and skip through to the arcs. You can find the list of the arcs here: http://www.yorozuyasoul.com/gintama/arcs
>> ARTICLE
Try to click on the videos and you will see that I picked the most epic fights. Plenty of good fights before that point, but indeed action is not the focus, but it's insane when it gets to that point. Other series get more fights, but it's nearly as intense as it gets in Gintama.

The Benizakura movie replaces episode 58-61 btw. 
>> ARTICLE
Should I watch the episodes or the movie?
>> ARTICLE
For all we know the movie is probably more canon than the actual episodes. There's a few added scenes.
>> ARTICLE
double posted dude.   

and yes, those added scenes are canon
>> ARTICLE
I watched both, as they are slightly different, but the movie is superior, I think. 
>> ARTICLE
The movie definitely is better, although personally I liked the pacing of the TV episodes more.
>> ARTICLE
The movie looks so much better and replaces the episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I've heard that this only gets good around episode 80. Can I just jump in there? I don't want to stay committed for 80 episodes before getting a payoff, I could rewatch Madoka, what, 7 times for that?
>> ARTICLE
It differs from person to person. For me its after eps 25 that I really feels that "Ok this show is really good". But by no any means the beginning part of Gintama is bad, it's just this show is the type that gets better and better the longer it goes, to the point that the beginning episodes pales in comparison to the later. 

Jumping is definitely not recommended because you'll miss a large portion of character introduction and the running gags. But if you REALLY have to, watch the first 25 eps for the character introduction and jump through to the arcs listed in here: http://www.yorozuyasoul.com/gintama/arcs  And this is also some of the good comedy episode to watch: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-08-12/how-to-satisfy-your-curiosity-about-gintama/.91586
>> ARTICLE
> But if you REALLY have to, watch the first 25 eps for the character introduction and jump through to the arcs listed in here:

I really don't want people to do this. Just drop it if you need to resolve to this imo.
>> ARTICLE
Well sometimes people need to get "baited". That's how I managed to get my friends into Gintama, I showed them some clips and random episodes that are really funny or cool, recommend some episodes and they will start to watch from the beginning if they're interested.
>> ARTICLE
I see where you are coming from, but it still pains me that people do that...
>> ARTICLE
What /u/Azelvan suggested is actually quite similar to what I did - and truthfully the only way I had enough motivation to finish/catch up on the entire series in only a few months this year. Yes it's not the most ideal, but the major arcs really keep you stimulated and enthused to watch the rest - and there is also less pressure to keep marathoning! Probably not the best method for everyone, but definitely works for some - Gintama literally propelled itself to the top of my favorites list because of this!
>> ARTICLE
Definitely not, the comedy episodes are essentially what made this series so popular and knowing this silly side of the different cast-members is very important for the characterization and makes you fall in love them over the course of the series. 

I found this this series getting better starting from episode 38, where the episode really begin to get more funnier and funnier until it achieves god-status at some point. Many people loved even the imo weaker beginning of this series too. Start with episode 3 btw, if you decide to pick up this series.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed 1000% with your comment. Both the comedic and serious arcs are essential to not just the character development but also world building of this series. When viewed in conjunction they make becoming attached to the characters effortless!
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why people said 'It gets good later on!'

It had always been great from the start, at least for me. It just got better and better, that's all.
>> ARTICLE
what about the fight gintoki and shinpachi vs the kyubei and the old guy 
>> ARTICLE
I considered adding this, but I thought that this fight wasn't as great as the other fights of this series.(Still some pretty awesome scenes). I will take another look at it though, thanks for the notice.
>> ARTICLE
Could you add the part of Gintoki vs Takasugi with the short flashbacks in between?
>> ARTICLE
Hope to see more awesome fights uploaded to this thread when the inevitable next season is aired. :p
>> ARTICLE
There were a couple scenes missing in the Gintoki vs Takasugi full fight cut, such as them fist fighting. Here's another cut by a YouTuber: https://youtu.be/Hfc3oullf7k?t=633
>> ARTICLE
I wish the whole anime would be like that. I really dislike the humor and comedy of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Did you only watch the first episodes? The comedy gets much better too along with the story. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but I really can't stand it. And if I don't like the first episodes I doubt I like the humor in general.
>> ARTICLE
This is late reply but imo, NEVER just watch the few first eps of long running shounens, they are like never good anyway. They really need to build up and form itself.
>> ARTICLE
Believe me when I say the first few episodes are nothing compared to the rest of the series. They're essentially character introductions, I haven't found a single person yet who's watched about 30-40 episodes and thought it wasn't funny. And did you skip the first 2 episodes or watched them?
>> ARTICLE
You...only watch the first episode,what a pity since episode 1 is just a episode to  celebrate the anime release and is not really good compare to the others.          
[Give this scene a try and maybe you will like it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A5fGufFWCI)
>> ARTICLE
I dont even know what year Gintama is supposed to be in. Some look like samurai age, then he wears a modern suit and then that other guy got porn DVDs... very strange

These 10 minutes were nothing for me :(

It's like a joke being stretched over the whole episode.
>> ARTICLE
The setting is supposed to be a mix of the two. Samurai age with modern technological advances due to Amanto aliens coming to Earth.

And sounds like you won't reaenjoy Gintama if you didn't find that funny at all :(
>> ARTICLE
Nothing to be sad about :)
>> ARTICLE
Some people just don't want happiness, let them be ;D
>> ARTICLE
You should try to watch the first episodes of Gintama'(Episode 202) or Gintama(Episode 266) maybe that will change your mind a little.
>> ARTICLE
give it a watch when you got depressed or heart broken. its really good for your health.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't make me laugh though. I just watch some other animes, but thanks :)
>> ARTICLE
You mean I have to watch 100 episodes to get to a good scene?
>> ARTICLE
there a lots of good scene in comedy arcs. just the serious arc where the epic fight happens is on later episodes.

edit: well just watch the movie. each of those have epic fight scene and you should already know the main characters from all the gintama gifs in this sub.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, thread clearly says best fight scenes of the entire series. Plenty  of great scenes outside of these episodes. 




>> ARTICLE
sadly the most popular things in anime its fight scenes so fans usually care less about the other things
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, sad because it's the whole package what makes this anime a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
At this rate, the entire top 10 will be Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
Just checked, 5 entries of Gintama are already in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
The other ones were all already in the Top 10
>> ARTICLE
This will actually become true if MAL continues to give each season another entry. The manga gets better and better.
>> ARTICLE
>The manga gets better and better.

How is that even possible. I just ... What
>> ARTICLE
We're getting some MAJOR character developments.
>> ARTICLE
Based Cyborg Sorachi-sensei
>> ARTICLE
*Gorilla cyborg.
>> ARTICLE
It'll come down.

>this kind of stuff is why you should never take MAL ratings seriously. 

[As this thread shows, that doubles down for shows that are not finished.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/31gk5n/mal_score_progression_winter_season_2015/)
>> ARTICLE
Will it? 4/10 from the Top 10 are Gintama series, or Gintama movies xDDD
>> ARTICLE
Eh, if it happens to be at the No. 1 spot when the series ends, I'll be fine with that. I've never watched Gintama, but I only ever hear good things about it (save for the slow start), so perhaps it deserves that top spot. It is annoying however that, due to the way that MAL separates different seasons/movies, it takes up half the top ten.
>> ARTICLE
MAL should just take an average of separate seasons' ratings or something, especially for shows with a million episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Currently 5/10.
>> ARTICLE
I love what happened to Cross Ange.
>> ARTICLE
damn that reminded me that I need to get around to finnishing that one.
>> ARTICLE
tbf I haven't finished it 'cause I took an anime hiatus, but I remember talking about how it just keeps getting better episode to episode and that graph backs that up.
>> ARTICLE
And sequels.  You need to take any sequels' rating with a grain of salt because for the most part those who hated the first season wouldn't watch the second, third, etc.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I think after story is so high. I mean yes, it's my second favourite show, but it is a sequel.

Code geass on the other hand...both series deserve their insanely high scores 
>> ARTICLE
Ehhhhh season 2 was debatable...
>> ARTICLE
Also MAL excludes ratings if you've watched less than 20% of the series after it finishes. If people didn't enjoy it after their three episode rule or similar, MAL ignores it
>> ARTICLE
Case in point: Shirobako was under 7.28 for the first 12 episodes and stayed under 7.72 until the penultimate episode. It sits at nice 8.43 right now.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, ratings for finished shows are much more accurate to display one's anime popularity. It will all be balanced out as time goes.
>> ARTICLE
So half of the top 10 is Gintama... I see.
>> ARTICLE
They should have just made one single entry for the whole series imo.
>> ARTICLE
MAL admins aren't even trying anymore.. Nothing improves and they don't have to because people will use it anyways.
>> ARTICLE
Whiiich is why I use Anime Planet instead of MAL, honestly. MAL's layout feels like it hasn't been updated since the early 2000s.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, nothing else is even comparable. Hummingbird had promise but it ended up being clunky and unusable. Anilist isn't bad at all but I'm not fond of the lack of detailed css customization and some other issues with it. 

People keep trying to make new sites but leave out a ton of shit MAL still provides. If they're going to legitimately compete, they have to show *everything* MAL does, and then go to the next level. They need to also stop releasing half done sites with promises of "We'll be updating!" because people like me, again, join Hummingbird, see an inferior product, and never really bother going back. Just do the extra work, make an amazing site that's better than MAL, and release it when it's *ready*.

Hey come on, we got kittens at least.

No, because then they would have to do that for every other series.

MAL literally splits up everything that is even remotely seperable.

For example, ''episode 0'' of Fate/Stay Night: UBW has it's own entry, just because it's considered a prologue even though it aired as the first episode in the series, and is packaged in the same BD volume. 

>> ARTICLE
Because if they didn't it would imply a huge change to the system, because then a show you've completed could become not completed when a new season is announced, and you also couldn't rate them separately. 
>> ARTICLE
> then a show you've completed could become not completed when a new season is announced

tbf this can happen anyway, happened with the Angel Beats OVA at least.

> you also couldn't rate them separately.

Totes agree with this, though i'd like to be able to see them as one, I don't want to have to rate series as one, especially when you get to the long ones and it's had it's ups and downs.
>> ARTICLE
>tbf this can happen anyway, happened with the Angel Beats OVA at least.

Yeah, that's the only one it's happened with to me, I think they try to avoid it as much as possible.

That's stupid, imagine Gintama getting 2 more movies and a few more seasons, which is quite an realistic scenario. The top 10 will be literally Gintama. (Not that I would complain about it haha)

Hummingbird manages to have this nice feature, but it's kinda ugly and messy.

Anidb has this, complete with timelines. Here's [Bakemonogatari](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=rel&aid=6327) and [Haruhi](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=rel&aid=3651) as examples.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Gintama fans *really* like their Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
Well the only people even rating it will be the ones who sat through the 200+ episodes to get to this season.  So they might be *slightly* skewed.
>> ARTICLE
Well not necessarily, just look at naruto shipudden
>> ARTICLE
The way MAL ratings are worked out is stupid. Rating something while it is airing shouldn't hold as much weight as something that has finished. Also numbers of ratings should also sway how the final rating works out.
>> ARTICLE
I was always under impression MAL scores don't count until the person hasn't watched at least 50% of the episodes. Apparently, I've been mistaken.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's 20% and it only applies when it ends.
>> ARTICLE
When a show finishes it only uses scores of those who have watched 20%+. See the score progression for [Shirobako](http://i.imgur.com/cOcr14e.png) for instance.
>> ARTICLE
That'd make it imposible to rate endless, formulaic shows like One Piece or Naruto that just keep vomiting episodes over and over.
>> ARTICLE
The biggest issue with series that are split into multiple seasons is that usually people who rated it low will stop watching after one season or less, so if the sequels are remotely close to the original they will be rated higher and higher as more people drop off.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
It'd be different for Monogatari though, they literally are different shows. Same with Sword Art Online and others, I feel. But group shit like Baby Steps, Diamond no Ace, Gintama, Yowapeda, etc, right in with each other, sure.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I add the extra entries to my MAL but do not give them any rating (Rating: -), that way when I sort by score they are all down there at the bottom.  My rating of the first season is my rating for the franchise as a whole.
>> ARTICLE
What I've started doing is tagging first season/series of a show as "Series1" so I can just click the tag and get more a clean board, I'm now tempted to also do what you're doing and using the first season's rating as an overall.
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes different seasons are of different quality, so this doesn't really work for me.
>> ARTICLE
Having separate ratings for each season/ova/whatever makes sense and is fine, but the score displayed in the "Top" section, etc. should be an average for the series as a whole based on ratings for each individual entry. This obviously isn't a perfect solution either but it's certainly better than having a dozen entries that are functionally the same thing clogging the system.
>> ARTICLE
I can see it now. 
Gintama Season 10: 20 people watched, Mal Score-9.9
>> ARTICLE
>20 people watched

Nah, no way.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. There is no way it wouldn't get a 10.
>> ARTICLE
This is doubly so with gintama, which has multiple seasons, with the first containing just over 200 episodes, few people would finish something of that length if they thought it was bad, and unlike say, Naruto, it doesn't have a sizable portion of viewers who have watched it since childhood and continue despite them losing interest, that could bring the rating down, simply because the show has to my knowledge, never been aired on tv outside of japan.

That's why having separate ratings for each different season and one averaged-out rating for the series would be a decent alternative to the current clusterfuck system.

I think the One Punch Man rating is even more stupid. This show is ranked 17 and it will air in October.....

Last time I checked something as completed noone from MAL came to my house to quiz me on the series so I'm going to asume that people can just say they've completed a series and rate it a 1 without ever watching it.

Yes, I know, I'm just saying. Not entirely sure why anybody would bother with the effort though.

Yeah, but most people won't. Unless they're the kind of people that'll rate low out of spite/desire to see what they like higher in rankings, which are few and far between.

Well...
>> ARTICLE
I think MAL ratings can be useful for shows that have been completed, but for currently airing shows they serve as an indicator at best. Kind of absurd that Gintama is number one. It is going to be annoying having like 8 Gintama's as the top 10, but whatever. People criticize fans of all popular shows except for those of Gintama. 
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone actually care about MAL ratings?
>> ARTICLE
I use the ratings for reference to find what I wanna watch next. If more people like it, it is likely to be good, but that's not the case every time. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a lot of shows people seem to be afraid to touch, because MAL didn't like it.  People uneasy about trying a show in the low 7s or worse.

So yes, apparently.
>> ARTICLE
That's partially just because MAL averages tend to be fairly high, looking through the top list, the first show with an average of 5.0 or below is currently at position 7530, and from 7634, only 100 or so later you get to the obscure stuff that nobody has ever rated (that or it's universally rated 0) and there are 3283 shows with a rating of 7 or higher. as a result, 7 seems really low, and as far as the list is concerned, it is. people look, see that there are literally thousands of shows rated higher, and are naturally reluctant. 

Now, obviously, these ratings aren't necessarily indicative of anything besides majority opinion, so there's no reason that people should take them as anything else, but people are obviously more likely than not to side with the majority, otherwise it wouldn't be the majority.
>> ARTICLE
MAL scores don't always tell the whole story in my experience.  A poor score could be just a plain old mediocre show, or it could reflect a show that's love or hate.  Those niche shows that don't quite fit into MAL's general preferences, and have their own flaws and peculiarities that can be off-putting, but those that like it *really* like it.  And if one gravitates towards shows with higher ratings, it is the safe bet, but I feel you miss out on a lot.  I feel it's important for people to experiment, try unsafe shows, find their niches. 

I do get it though.  There's a reason the popular shows got popular in the first place.  And in this case, we are talking about the type of people who would be dissuaded from trying out a show solely due to a poor MAL score.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly, it comes up quite often in discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I do. My standard deviation for the shows I watch tends to be within a point, so it's a good call for shows I at least like the premise of. Gintama isn't my thing at all so I can pretty much ignore its ratings, but as long as a show is in a genre I enjoy and has a premise I like, more often than not MAL's ratings are pretty close to mine.
>> ARTICLE
Well there's always that guy who says "its top 50 on MAL so it MUST be good!" When defending his favorite show, but no, mal ratings shouldn't matter at all.
>> ARTICLE
To play devil's advocate here, you'll never see truly shit shows in the top because they're just not good enough to garner high aggregate scores even with a hugely loyal fanbase. The vast majority of ratings will be low for those shows.

The same thing goes, *generally*, for good shows. A good show will be more popular on average and garner generally higher scores, meaning it will sit higher on MAL than other shows.
>> ARTICLE
Well in fairness a lot of the shows in the top 50 are great. 

At the end of the day people will always have different opinions. For every show, there will always be people who like it and dislike it, no matter how ''good'' or ''bad'' it is. With this logic, every rating-based website ''shouldn't matter at all''. 
>> ARTICLE
A rating system is only as good as the userbase, really. MAL's hugely popular, which means the ratings are great to give you a general idea of what's popular with the current anime fandom, but you're also going to get stuff that has broader appeal get to the top quicker, so stuff that's too niche or highbrow is probably not going to do well as, say, a well-done but uncomplicated action show.

I also think it seems to be heavily weighed toward newer shows, and I'm not really sure why that is. A reflection of a younger userbase, maybe?

It makes a good source of stuff to consider trying, at the least.

>> ARTICLE
As a casual watcher of anime, i do use ratings websites to get a feel of what was popular and might be good. Is there a better ratings site than MAL? (Honest question)
>> ARTICLE
AniDB is much better. Firstly, their simple average of entries isn't as inflationary as MAL's. Secondly, their rating (weighted average) makes sense. MAL's algorithm seems like to be programed by someone who has barely any idea of statistics. And thirdly, AniDB's rating are a bit more reasonable than MAL's.

[Here is the list of all entries sorted by rating](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?type.web=1&type.unknown=1&type.tvspecial=1&type.tvseries=1&type.ova=1&type.other=1&type.musicvideo=1&type.movie=1&show=animelist&orderby.rating=0.2&orderby.name=1.1&noalias=1&do.filter=1)

.
>> ARTICLE
>Aria, Time of Eve, Ping Pong, and three entries for Mushishi in the Top 30

I'm okay with these listings. 
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, I dont think theres much of a difference between the ratings in both sites. Yes, MAL scores can be inflated, but the top rated shows on MAL are distributed between the top shows of AniDB with pretty small differences in ratings.

Also MAL seems to have a bigger userbase, so I'd consider most shows to be rated by popularity instead of quality.
>> ARTICLE
The main problem with MAL's rating is the fact that everything below 7.5 is considered bad and everything below 7.0 is terrible. Why does it not utilize the entire scale? Because it's prossible, just look at AniDB's ratings. 

Something "normal" rated like Another has a 7.99 on MAL, but a 6.29 on AniDB. Sure the top shows are very similar. But MAL's ratings are just skewed for everything which is not rated the best.
>> ARTICLE
1-10 ratings seem to mostly be based off of a teachers ratings of test. So that 90-100 is an A, 80-90 is a B, etc... and everything below 60 is an F. 0-4 ratings seem to be more based off the letter grades themselves. Such that 4 is an A, 3 is a B, etc...
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm not from the US. Where I'm from you have to have at least 50% to have a passable grade and below that we still have two different grades: poor ("E") and fail (F). The question is why would you apply school grades on anime ratings? This idea didn't even cross my mind until I saw that people actually do this.
>> ARTICLE
MAL is already very good for this.
>> ARTICLE
What's even more hilarious than Gintama getting spot 1 after a single episode is how 3,5% of the votes are now 1's. I guess some people really hate the hypetrain.

I love Gintama but this is just silly.

To be fair, it happens to ALMOST ALL anime this season. No exception (including Hibike Euphonium and UBW). People just salty since Gintama hogging the highest spot for 1st episode, while weeks before it was UBW. Ratings will balanced out later, like they always have been every season.

Over 100 people have already marked it a 1 to get it below FMAB. The salt is just as stupid as the hype.

Yeesh. What happens when I mention I'm not even interested in giving it a shot then?
>> ARTICLE
No my internet was just down and I already preloaded it.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't get any better in that regard, I'm enjoying it as a comedy but aside from that it's really no good. Currently there's a shounen-ish arc in the manga which people here seem to praise the shit out of but honestly it's REALLY edgy and clicheed nakama shit. Gintama should stick to comedy only.

The popularity in rating sites like MAL are honestly just some funny circlejerks from their fanbase mixed with delusional fans who actually think it's the best anime out there (Note: There are millions of anime watchers who don't give a shit about your ratings). You will notice how Gintama isn't actually that popular due to it's lack of actual plot and continuity. Plus their 'serious' arcs are mostly subpar, edgy and seriously cringeworthy.

People say Gintama is the whole package but it's actually just a pretty fun comedy and pretty bad at everything else. Let the downvotes rain.
>> ARTICLE
>People say Gintama is the whole package but it's actually just a pretty fun comedy and pretty bad at everything else. 

Lol, Gintama has some of the best emotional moments I've seen in anime. Cliche, yes at times, but definitely not "edgy" or "cringeworthy". Sougo's sister's arc was one of the most beautiful things I've seen in anime.
>> ARTICLE
I completely disagree. I love the serious arcs as well as the comedy episodes. It's a great mix actually.

btw it's feels "shounen-ish" because it is a shounen manga published in Shounen Jump lol, not sure what you expect.

Gintama has a fantastic cast and gives zero fucks, constantly defies common sense and surprises with obscurity. That's why people love it so much. It is one of a few series which is well-liked by both genders (at least in Asia) and people love it for what is is.

The actions scenes are simply awesome and the serious arcs are fast paced, while delivering epic moments fantastically.

Gintama has no bounds and that's why people like it and it's much more than simple comedy. People feel with the characters, because they are so goddamn authentic and share their feelings in the sad episodes as well as in the happy ones. 

You just seem salty because people like what you don't like.





>> ARTICLE
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Watching 70 episodes should be more than enough episodes to figure out if you like something or not.
>> ARTICLE
Well I just wanted to share my opinion. :P

Gintama had not a real plot and was more an episodic comedy Anime, which is fine by me (I really enjoyed Beelzebub) but I guess It wasn't my type of humor. 

While I enjoyed some Episodes, mainly the ones with the captain of the Shinsengumi, most of the time I was really bored. And I also didn't feel like pausing the Anime everytime they make a joke about a Japanese actor or a japanese pun just to read the explanation. 

Then there were also a few sad stories which took 1-2 Episodes. They felt so generic like they were from the Pokemon Anime. I didn't care much about them. The Benizakura arc was good though.

It didn't seem like an Anime worth watching +200 Episodes of. So I dropped it, even though I try to finish most of the Anime I watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Same reason I stopped watching it, the episodes that were good were *really good*.  But those episodes are so far and few between that the boring plots/episodes massively weigh down on what I really enjoyed.  Hard to sit through 200+ episodes to find 50 episodes that I find worthwhile.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is mostly comedy where as it sounds like you want a battle shounen, I would say you would probably be more of a HunterXHunter type of guy.
Seriously though if you love Comedy anime like Nichijou and Fumoffu and have an interest in battle shounen then Gintama is 100% more enjoyable
>> ARTICLE
Wow, the opposite was true for me. I found Beelzebub very boring and average but Gintama hilarious and just really entertaining in general. Funny how tastes work, huh.
>> ARTICLE
Beelzebub isn't an episodic comedy. It's a shounen battle anime/manga.
>> ARTICLE
After 70 episodes you gave it more than it's fair chance.

Well, at least this time it actually came out before getting to #1.

It's something thing to bitch about. People love bitching.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is a case in which most people watching it are its hardcore fans. The best way to judge anime like Gintama is by using the score of its first season, which is 9.05 which is still high but should be more representative and true to its quality 
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure as time goes on it'll fall a few places.  I assume there are petty people who will vote it 1/10 without watching it because they don't think it deserves the spot it has as well.

While I'm happy that my favorite anime is highly rated, I do agree that MAL should merge at least all the Gintama seasons.

I remember a few years back, Gintama' was #1 while it was airing. I'd say that the new season will where it is for quite a while.

I noticed also that people "reviewed" their ratings of the original Gintama, so it became with 9.16/10 above Hunter x Hunter (9.15/10).

The original Gintama is still at #10 with a 9.05 score. You're looking at Gintama' (the sequel to gintama).

It will probably go back down after a couple of episodes.

Judging by tags it doesn't seem like my kind of anime, will have to give it a shot one day it seems though!

Gintama really is it's own thing so it's hard to judge it by its tags. The characters are just so fun and awesome. I see that you like Durarara!! and even though they aren't that similar they both have the same huge cast of loveable characters. Also Durarara's author's favorite manga is Gintama :D
>> ARTICLE
Similar to Durarara would be a good reason to give it a chance. Just so much episodes haha it's a bit daunting 


>> ARTICLE
Yeah for sure. However Gintama is a perfect anime to just watch at your own pace. 1-2 episodes every couple of days or even just once a week on the side of other anime. Eventually you'll love it so much that you'll be glad it's so long. At least that's how I was :)

They aren't really similar, but actually a lot of the characters' personalities are. They both have some of the best characters casts in anime.

Question for gintama fans. Is this show more than just a weekly gag show? From what I've seen it seems to be a loosely tied together story patched together with a lot of pretty well written gag scenes. Why am I wrong? 
>> ARTICLE
It is primarily a comedy show but saying its only doing comedy is a disservice to the various genres Gintama pokes at (and at times, excelled in writing them). 

Its best to think Gintama as a long running amalgamation of 

- Rurouni Kenshin (shared the most major trope I think) 
- Mushishi, Natsume Book of Friends (episodic-zen/lessons) 
- Nichibros (shared the same VAs and their styles, since duh, based-Sunrise) 
- Dr Slump (atmosphere) 
- insert-your-favorite-romance-anime (pairings and well-done romantic arcs) 
- Gundam x Star Wars x Gintama (for their own metaverse) 
- DragonBleaPeace (the 3 big shounen minus Naruto) x Dragon Quest 
- insert-your-favorite-feels-anime (sometimes cliched, but very well executed). 
- Shitcom (since poops galore)
- South Park (the amount of vulgarity breaking thru the roof)
- The Simpsons (specifically, the theme of family and home. No, not nakama. Family, and home. Its very easy to miss-judged it but the so-called final movie will present the theme perfectly.)

All that said, Gintama is not called *Anime - The Anime* for nothing. 

So yes, it's more than a weekly gag show. Its really up to the viewer to find what they want to find in Gintama. The more anime you watch, the better you can appreciate Gintama for trying to be what it is. A *home* you can come back to and, really, just have fun.

So fucking what? Maybe it's good? Nothing wrong with rating a series a 9 from one episode and changing accordingly as the season goes on. I gave Plastic Memories a 9 because I said, "Holy shit that was great!" Which...is exactly what MAL says a 9 is. Will it continue to be a 9? Maybe, maybe not. But right now, it is, to me.

And MAL ratings are a hell of a lot better than something like AniDB's shit.
>> ARTICLE
What's so bad with it being #1? It's another franchise/heavy length series show sure but if people who liked the 270 or so episodes so far to rate it high why moan?
>> ARTICLE
Only 1 episode is out though. Nothing wrong with the franchise or anything
>> ARTICLE
Most manga readers say the upcoming arcs are some of the best. I know there is only 1 episode of this season but the fans had heaps in the past to know that they will like it a lot.
>> ARTICLE
It's silly to base a show on the part of the source that hasn't been adapted yet. They could completely fuck it up as many have done in the past. I doubt it in this case though.
>> ARTICLE
They had 265 episodes,a couple of specials and a movie to prove they won't fuck it up tokyo ghoul style.
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't mean anything at all. What if the next episodes are completely poor adaptions of the manga?

You never know. I'm not saying we should like protest to MAL or anything, it's just kinda bad to have an anime with only 1 episode out as the #1.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really get the issue here, or why the other guy got downvoted. So something with 1 episode is at #1... Wait a week and it'll be something with 2 episodes. Wait 10 weeks and it'll have 10 episodes. Eventually it'll be finished with plenty of episodes, and on top of that it likely won't even be #1 anymore.

You should also realize there's a boatload of content that people can use as a basis for making an early judgement call here.
>> ARTICLE
Because the way mal rates shit is stupid. 1 episode and it's already the best anime in existence? Give me a break. Also like I said, you can't bring source material into the equation since you don't even know if it's a good adaption
>> ARTICLE
1 episode **of something with 265 prior episodes, 2 movies and a couple specials.** It's a long-time franchise, not some piddly nobody or a big manga testing out the anime waters. The chances of it fucking up badly are so abysmally low they're not even worth talking about.
>> ARTICLE
Does. Not. Matter. 1 episode shouldn't make it the best anime ever just cause previous seasons and the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Does matter. It's a continuation. Every single thing that came out before it built it up and everything foretold in the manga solidifies where it's heading. I'll say it again: The chances of it messing up are so abysmally low they are not even worth mentioning. 

There is no reason for people who are watching it to *not* give it a similar score to what they gave the previous entries in the franchise.
>> ARTICLE
Manga does NOT matter. 


This is anime. You want to hype up the manga? Go rate the manga. 

There's no reason to rate an anime with only the first episode out at all. Certainly not a 10.

No. Of course not. 4 seasons of 81 episodes with [multiple nominations (including one winner)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Prison_Break) *totally* isn't enough to consider it popular.

Nah, I think an "emotionally void" psychopathic killer who literally spends 10 minutes per episode talking about his emotional problems and is driven almost exclusively by emotion can be hard to buy for some people.

Nah. Just not a good character.

Looks like somebody hasn't seen Gintama, haha. It's real. Not the most obscure thing referenced in Gintama either.
>> ARTICLE
A side note to those episode openers, they once said in the anime, that they have one guy doing those, independently from the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
This isn't true. At least not 100% true. The manga and anime have the same titles, so, while there probably is a guy who picks which title is best for the episode, they're made by Sorachi (the mangaka).

Oh okay, thanks for the information :)

Prison Break wasn't popular? Come on. Next you'll say Lost wasn't just because it ended and isn't relevant anymore.

To be fair, the ending killed a lot of the popularity it had.

But it WAS popular.
>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest, I was 11 in 2005 when Prison Break premiered and I remember the first commercials for it and it dropped off the radar for me. I guess I was too young to watch it and it wasn't my parents' show of choice so I had no idea how popular it was.

I never watched LOST but I saw constant commercials for it for years and heard people talking about it. You'll even see a Smoke Monster or other LOST reference on Reddit from time to time.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah that was on there. I watched Prison Break before Gintama (not straight before but a year or two) so when I saw it I was really surprised as I didn't think Prison Break would be much of a thing in Japan. It is definitely popular in the West though, I'm in the UK and everyone of my friends has watched it and some more people I know have. I take it that it's as popular in the US where it came from. 

This title card said this because it was a prison episode so I guess it sort of made sense and I use it for saying why Prison Break S2 is still called Prison Break to people. 

Out of curiosity, did you actually see the title card as a meme somewhere or did you just see it, take a screenshot and call it a meme?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah some guy from Sweden said it was popular there and people have said in this thread that American TV has a presence in Japan, so really Prison Break is just something I overlooked because I was too young to be its target audience at the time it aired.

It regards to the title screen shot, I've seen it around a few times. It was recently reposted to /r/anime_irl

I just started watching Gintama this week! The start to the third season (ep 25 I think)  was hilarious! 
Kagura is my favorite as well awesome fanart! 
>> ARTICLE
Just what is Gintama really about? I remember once watching like ~3-4 episodes but I felt like the plot was going nowhere at all and failed to keep watching. If you had to summarize it in 3-5 sentences, what's so great about Gintama?
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I find it great because the series doesn't try in the least to take itself seriously. From the get go, it always seems like the viewer is watching a show of the characters and their wacky-ass world. It might sound dumb but I always feel like there's just a camera man following the characters around while they live their lives. The world feels truly real and alive and because of that the show itself doesn't feel singular because there was no plan stating "okay, we're an action/drama anime, we need to have action now/we need to have drama now!". And just like life, some days are funny, some are serious, some have action. In Gintama as well, you never know what genre the next episode or arc is gonna focus on and I think that's great. Plus the humor is always on point for me, and I love when they break the fourth wall just to troll the viewer.
>> ARTICLE
Every desent comedy has a sub-genre. Heartwarming, romance, action, etc. Gintama starts out confused, not knowing what kind of comedy it should be, so it tries them out, one at a time. After the Benizakura arc, where it tries the action route, it gives up and just does everything. 

And it works.
>> ARTICLE
So how many episodes does Gintama take to start getting "really" interesting? And as I understood, there are actual arcs? Is there some sort of central theme that the story progresses around?
>> ARTICLE
It got "enjoyable" for me when they played an episode that literally had the opening cinematic play during the middle of the episode because Gintoki was sleeping during the beginning and I thought that was hilarious. As for "interesting" like an actual plot, it's not quite there yet for me (plot-wise) but I don't mind because I like how lax it is. I'm practically there, but I'm looking forward to the Benizakura arc which is when many people say the more serious plot pops up as well as the action.
>> ARTICLE
It depends on the person, really. I actually got interested around 50, and even then I wasn't sure. But then again, I still somehow watched though my unsure-ness and continued to watch it, and its now one of my favorite shows, if not the favorite. A lot of people say ep 25 is the turning point though, so at least watch until there, considering it is most people's favorite episode of the series.

There is an actual theme in the show, but that's mostly conveyed through the several serious arcs that come about once in a while. 

Basically, its comedy until it decides to get serious and continue on with the big picture, then goes back to comedy. 

While this might seem like the contrast would be jarring and weird, it actually works for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is basically the "canon filler" anime as it's largely episodic (not to say that all single-episode stories are for laughs) with occasional serious arcs and some arcs that play into Gintoki's past. Gintama is about family and friendship, the love that comes with it (Gintama is a Jump series, remember) and loss and badass characters. It's about a lazy war vet samurai who takes two kids under his featherless wing and these idiots just mess around or save the country. Gintama is about fleshing out the many characters and whatever story follows them. 
>> ARTICLE
If I had to sum up why Gintama appeals to so many people I'd probably say something like this:

The characters of Gintama start off simple, but all are eventually given context to their actions that flesh out them out. The setting allows for pretty much any type of plotline to happen. There's romance, mystery, horror, action, drama, and sci-fi despite being primarily a comedy/parody anime (and manga). Finally, the theme of trying to protect what's important to you is made stronger by each characters' past losses. They all strive to protect what they have as a result of their past failures.

The comedy isn't for everyone in Gintama, yet if you give the anime a chance to show you who the characters are, I think you may even laugh at the most ridiculous and nonsensical of gags. Knowing the characters only makes the comedy itself stronger, in my opinion. That's why people love it, especially since there isn't really a main "goal" for our protagonists to achieve.

 NOTE: Sorry I went more than five sentences, there was a lot I wanted to say.

Another note on the second movie (Gintama: The Movie: The Final Chapter: Be Forever Yorozuya) some say it isn't quite canon, it honestly still feels like it is to me because Sorachi actually wrote the story himself and did some storyboarding as a guide for the people making the film.

I've never stated there is no overarching plot. Simply that there is no direct plot such as "We must defeat Villain X to save the world". And yes, while those arcs do contribute to the main eventual plot which will unfold it is not there yet, thusly a stepping stone. We know what will happen at step 5 (or well, predict) because the previous steps have given us clues and parts of it.
>> ARTICLE
>Simply that there is no direct plot such as "We must defeat Villain X to save the world".  
  
Well, eventually Gintoki is going to have to take down Takasugi, as shown in the "This is the last episode of Gintama" episodes.

I'm really curious. Is this group one that has appeared in the anime or maybe been alluded to? Don't have to spoil the name, just if they have appeared/been alluded to :)

Never trust soy. Soy can be very dark and quite salty.

That is a much better way to explain it than in the OP. I misinterpreted when you said "..but certain pieces of it are there. Think of the arcs as stepping stones".
>> ARTICLE
True, apologies for being vague.

Gintoki disagrees with you:

>> ARTICLE
that's a quip at itself. Gintama does indeed have a plot. latest manga arcs have HUGE IMPLICATIONS for the series. everytime a new character is introduced, it adds to the pot and more stories can be used.


>> ARTICLE
Right now i absolutely love The Red Spider arc. Such a fantastic villain and was quite emotionally gripping. Also that black and white stylistic fight was probably the most perfect, intense directing choice i've seen in a while. Looking forward to other serious arcs (and obviously the comedy stuff as well)
>> ARTICLE
Every serious arc up until now has felt like a setup for the future, and it feels like at some point gintama is going to take over and be the top manga/anime, cause it definitely deserves it
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree with you here, until Benizakura arc it was just a goofy and funny anime/manga with bits of Gintoki's tragic past hinted here and there but from then on, in my opinion, the main theme of the manga shifted to serious arcs and in between them various funny usual arcs. Plot is really underrated, and serious arcs are probably one of the best if not the best of a manga/anime running in a Shounen magazine.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call Gintama arcs th e best out of any current shounen since the arcs cant begin to compare to the quality of Hunter x Hunter.

Also bear in mind that Gintama is praised and held in a high regard because of it's comedy,it's a comedy show first and foremost after all
>> ARTICLE
At the moment, the manga is *very* serious. Like it's more serious and depressing than you would ever expect Gintama to be.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm gonna pick that up, where is it in the anime atm?
Also I like Gintamas story and action way more than any other anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you've caught up to the anime, you can start the manga at chapter 411. That way I don't think you'll miss anything. There are a number of chapters that you will come across that are already animated, you can just skip those if you want.
>> ARTICLE
I'll do that, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Something that people may easily missed about Gintama:

It is a very Seinen show disguised under a Shounen front. The older you get the easier to see all the messages in Gintama and its poetic outlooks. It will throw turds here and there but sometimes, they can throw a heavy curveball that might hit you quite hard if you're not prepared.

If you watch it, pay attention to the older casts and Gintoki monologues. It may not seems much but the anology they sometime spouts hold some interesting perspective for the older viewers.
>> ARTICLE
How has nobody made a WT of this before now?!
>> ARTICLE
Apparently not, and as Gintama is one of my life-sources, i was like: Time to do one! Took me 3 hours.
>> ARTICLE
Probably cause no one needs a WT to actually watch Gintama, everyone should already be watching it.
>> ARTICLE
True...
>> ARTICLE
I started watching gintama recently after my friend showed me the episode where they scare gintoki with ghost during the reunion and gintoki was singing doraemon and the kuroko ghost stuff. I was literally laughing while lying on the floor. Fucking hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
Hah that was a great scene. My personal favoueite is 237-241 in episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I love how everyone on /r/anime seems to love Gintama, but /r/Gintama itself is half dead. Also why say Gintama has no linear plot, which is not really true. ~Sigh, anyways people should subscribe to /r/Gintama..a lot of work was done recently to make it look better and function better. 
>> ARTICLE
To add on to that, we're doing a daily rewatch of the show. We're only on episode 9 now, so if anyone wants to follow along with that.
>> ARTICLE
I just caught up to the latest episode 2 days ago and I gotta say it boggles my mind how this show continues to be overlooked by most of [/r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime)

Edit: grammar
>> ARTICLE
I don't think we read the same subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
I'm liking it so far but was wondering around what episode the video quality/art improve?
>> ARTICLE
The first 200 episodes of Gintama are in 4:3, thus depending where you watch it they might be pretty low quality. They switch to 16:9 in the +200 episode part and it gets [really good](http://i.imgur.com/p0g1HHk.gif). [Really](http://i.imgur.com/b8CHoGS.gif).
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching it on CR it's alright quality, can't wait to get to 16:9 though.
>> ARTICLE
CR don't explain the multitude of references Gintama makes in each episode. Just a heads up.
>> ARTICLE
which subs do you recommend?
>> ARTICLE
Have fun watching! Its a great series.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 202 is when they go 16:9 as well as increase the quality. They even make jokes about how they were 4:3 for so long.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!

That watch order is confusing.....

[Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) episodes 3-57 > [Gintama Movie 1: Shinyaku Benizakura-hen](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7472/Gintama_Movie:_Shinyaku_Benizakura-hen) (in replacement of episodes 58-61) > [Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) episodes 59-201 > [Gintama'](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9969/Gintama) episodes 1-51 (202-252 overall) > [Gintama':Enchousen](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15417/Gintama:_Enchousen) episodes 1-13 (253-265 overall) > [The currently airing Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28977/Gintama%C2%B0) episode 1 and onwards (episode 266 and onwards overall)

Episodes 1 and 2 are just specials to kickstart and celebrate the anime finally starting for manga readers. You can watch them if you want, but it's completely optional.

The first movie is a rendition and improvement of the Benizakura arc (episodes 58-61). You can watch those episodes if you want but it's highly recommended you watch the movie in replacement of them. You can watch both the episodes *and* the movie if you want as well.

[The second movie: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15335/Gintama_Movie:_Kanketsu-hen_-_Yorozuya_yo_Eien_Nare) is watchable anytime after episode 146 as all characters in the movie are introduced by then, but I reccomend you watch it after episode 265 since that's when it first aired and when everyone else first watched it.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the clarification. I've wanted to get into the show but heard its hard to get into. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, the first 20 or so episodes just has a slower and weaker start relative to the rest of the show. I wouldn't worry about that thought too much. Getting into Gintama and appreciating it is different for everyone.

>> ARTICLE
There are many many many references to different anime and japanese culture. But not knowing these wont lower your enjoyment of this, its more like of a bonus thing which will enhance it if you know them. While it's true the experience might be a little bit worse not knowing much, its still great. I say go for it. Most of the references are explained.
>> ARTICLE
I was so sure about what would come up when I opened the shinpachi link it is not even funny. 
>> ARTICLE
Wait there are 3 Gintama series? 
>> ARTICLE
One continuous series, they just named the different parts different things. Unlike some other series, they took a break when the anime caught up to the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I was just wondering what Gintama was. Cause one the site I watch, there's just Gintama and Gintama'. 
>> ARTICLE
I have watched 35 episodes so far. It's good, but not great, but I feel like it's slowly getting funnier. See you guys in 2 years, when I will  finish this series and make a post 'holy shite, guys I just finished Kintama and it's epic!'. 

Unless it gets really epic and I binge 200+ episodes in one week.
>> ARTICLE
The first major arc of Gintama ''Benizakura arc'' dont even start until episode 58 ! This was the arc that changed everything in the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Try about 3 a day. It'll take 3 months or so. Believe me, there are some arcs in gintama that make every other pale in comparison. Absolutely amazing. The first two cours of gintama are pretty much the weakest. It gets awesome.
>> ARTICLE
"Kintama"? You know too much...
>> ARTICLE
Uh, is this a reference or something? I wrote it with K because space fleet captain (sorry, forgot his name) kept calling Gintoki Kintoki and it was some sort of pun.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Kintoki translates to testicles I think
>> ARTICLE
No, kintama is translated to testicle. Kin= gold, tama= ball. That balls were precious as gold. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a story arc called Kintama spanning episodes 253-256. The "Kin" basically just means Gold whereas "Gin" means silver.
>> ARTICLE
I just have one question for you, I am very very intimidated by the episode length. Any advice? It seems like too much of a commitment for a comedy show.
>> ARTICLE
Not that long, I marathoned One piece.
>> ARTICLE
The longest anime I have seen is death note, which is 37 episodes long. So to me, ~200 episodes is way too much, and ~700 episodes is unthinkable
>> ARTICLE
I watched it during my lunch/dinner times. Since most episodes are episodic, they serve well for entertainment in short periods.
>> ARTICLE
That sounds quite nice
>> ARTICLE
Just watch a few episodes a day.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is my favourite anime of all time but when I first watched the whole series I averaged about an episode a day. I'd binge the long arcs and take breaks but overall it took me about a year. It's a show that's definitely about the journey, once you get hooked you don't even want to reach the end.
>> ARTICLE
As people have said, watch like 2-3 episodes a day. I found that when i tried to binge the comedy episodes, i became tired and didn't find the humor as funny. The serious arcs you can binge watch though
>> ARTICLE
Don't go into it with a binge mentality. 

Think of it more like a weekly sitcom, since that's what it is most of the time. Maybe you'll get really into it and watch 50 episodes in five days. Maybe not. But you wouldn't be afraid to pick up How I Met Your Mother (208 episodes) or Frasier (264 episodes) just because there's a bunch of seasons, would you?
>> ARTICLE
Come to think of it, my experience with these shows is just the random episode or two on TV. I do see where you are coming from. It's not afraid, more like thinking it is way too long. The binge mentality is coming into play here.


Thanks for this and sorry for being quite annoying with this. In the end, I might give it a shot, but I always hear something about waiting 38 episodes or something before it gets any good. What are your thoughts on the matter? 


>> ARTICLE
Much like Star Trek or Babylon 5, the first season (of 24 episodes) was below par, with the first two episodes being outright *bad* (and I recommend you skip those two altogether. Maybe go back later). It's only after the show was moved to a later timeslot and the showrunners were given more leeway that it really starts to take off.

TLDR

TLDR: Watch Gintama.

Hot DAMN did puberty hit Kagura and Shinpachi. And it hit them *good*. Who knew a pair of glasses could turn into a stone-cold bishie? Kagura, without your 'aru's, how the hell are we meant to characterize you? 

Hijikata. Vest. White shirt. Level of sexy does not compute. Send help.

I love how it's been five years and all of them are still the trash that they were before. 

Edit: There is gold all over this thread. You rule, Durinthal. And whoever else is rich enough to keep gilding.

>> ARTICLE
Shinpachi had moments which made me think of Uryuu from Bleach.

Referencing Rie Kugumiya and her tsundere voicing habits was pretty funny when Kagura made her entrance.

I can dig what those two will be in the future, but god damn I was happy when they put their old clothes on.

Repost from last week for some references. If you discovered other references and either don't know what they mean or could explain them, post them here. Sorry for bad quality screenshots, it seems that imgur can't handle 1080p.

In the second GinTama movie there are some jokes that are a bit hard to understand if you don't know what's going on, so you should know a few things before going into it.

The entire beginning of the movie is a parody of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT7ijnOHEDs). It's a Japanese anti-piracy ad that started airing before movies in 2007. The character with the camera head has been given the nickname "Eiga Dorobo" which translates to Movie Thief. It's a really crazy move by Sorachi to turn this random character from an ad into one of the main characters of the movie.

The [K-On! Movie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9617/K-On!_Movie) is one of the highest grossing late-night TV anime movies ever ([currently \#5](http://www.someanithing.com/268)) They ran several "Each time you watch this movie you get a piece of merchandise. Gather them all!" promotions, which Kagura [references here](http://i.imgur.com/zCBjSMi.jpg). Her eyes in this scene (which seem to be a mask) are a reference to K-On's artstyle as well, and the tickets in the back show scenes from Gintama's very own moe anime [Mantama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fiDeC4zBLM) from episode 256.

[The Wood Rises](http://i.imgur.com/JtruwKG.jpg) is a parody of the movie [The Wind Rises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises).

The [grunts, music and title](http://i.imgur.com/KkgHjmt.jpg) in this scene are a reference to [Fist of the North Star's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fist_of_the_North_Star) (Hokuto no Ken).

A Japanese word for sunglasses is "gurasan" (which is why Gintoki thought of [Madao](http://i.imgur.com/cv6PwjR.jpg) when he heard "Gura-san"), and a Japanese word for penis is "[chinpo](http://i.imgur.com/tkx71zQ.jpg)".

Kagura's voice actress, [Kugimiya Rie](http://myanimelist.net/people/8/Rie_Kugimiya), is most famous for voicing stereotypical [tsundere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere) characters such as Taiga in Toradora or Louise in Zero no Tsukaima. Basically if there's a tsundere loli in your anime, your number 1 pick for her VA would be Kugimiya Rie. That's what Gin is talking about when he talks about [a waste of her voice actress](http://i.imgur.com/vwtzulF.jpg).

[This](http://i.imgur.com/oS3GbCS.jpg) is a reference to the 1980's Japanese pop band [The Checkers](http://www.spirit-of-rock.com/les%20goupes/T/The%20Checkers/pics/01fc_1.jpg). Its singers, two guys called Fumiya and Takamoku (the two guys on the right in the picture I posted), didn't get along, split up, started solo careers and published "tell-all books" about their time in the band.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/C0ykS2f.jpg) is a reference to the idol group called [Ebisu Muscats](http://www.generasia.com/wiki/Ebisu_Muscats), made up entirely from JAV stars (Japanese Adult Video, aka porn) and [gravure idols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravure_idol) (NSFW). They're saying that Otsu-chan became a JAV star/Gravure idol.

There were also some references to the band [B'z](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%27z), but everybody who watched Gintama should be familiar with them by now. I think Sorachi really likes their music.

Edit: Thanks a lot /u/Durinthal for gilding this.

>> ARTICLE
> The K-On! Movie is one of the highest grossing anime movies ever, *I think it might even be THE highest grossing anime movie ever.*

LOL - pls.  It did well for an anime movie, but unless we're not counting Studio  Ghibli films as not being anime movies, it's not even close.
>> ARTICLE
I should edit that, I meant tie-in movie. I googled it, it's currently the 5th highest grossing TV anime movie behind the 3 Evangelion reboots and the third Madoka movie, but was the third when it came out, because the Eva 3.33 came out in 2012 and Madoka 3 came out in 2013.
>> ARTICLE
It's been said elsewhere in the thread, but thank you for filling us in on all of the references and things we may have missed as first-time, uncultured watchers!
>> ARTICLE
DAMN that Bonus Art album looks amazing! Also thanks to /u/Durinthal for popping my Reddit Gold cherry, you're far too kind.

### Final Thoughts
Here we are, the finale. That's quite a fitting poem for the end. Even though I joined in in the latter half of this re-watch I feel like Ive been taking part in these discussions since the start so I can only guess what it is like for those of you who actually were here from the start. Never the less I would like to thank /u/onurtag for running this re-watch as without it I probably wouldnt have put off watching this show for a while. In addition I would like to thank everyone who has either commented here or simply looked at what we all had to say, its been a blast with all of you around! Anyway thats enough of thanking people, shall we begin the Final Chapter?

---
###Gintama: The Final Chapter - Be Forever Yorozuya

Thanks to /u/ChuckCarmichael this anti-piracy advert and all the future more obscure references dont whoosh past my head.

I feel sorry for a mute character! What has this show done to me!? [Id watch it...](http://i.imgur.com/GLLeTyk.png) [Now this Im going to have to look up.](http://i.imgur.com/8Hx1ipM.png) So we time traveling now? And here I thought that the movie thief was only there for a gag. I dont remember seeing this mystical guy before in the flashbacks. Woo! Time travel!  

The future really sucks apparently. Fist of the North Star! That explains the mohawks. [I LOVE THIS FUTURE SHINPACHI SO MUCH IM TYPING IN CAPS!](http://i.imgur.com/UPZHsYW.png) [FUTURE KAGURA & SADAHARU!](http://i.imgur.com/OONuaKk.png) Can we have a spinoff with these characters? Their badass! Guras a proper tsundere now! I love this already. [Parasyte flashback anyone?](http://i.imgur.com/R7o4ZBK.png) Theres our reference to The Checkers! I never noticed Kagura saying aru all the time. I see Hasegawa hasnt changed much. [Tama the Tankmaid?](http://i.imgur.com/VDTudmf.png) I think Thomas the Tank Engine still sounds better. Im counting on the Gin of the future showing up later. Its that mystical guy again! 

What a funny coincidence that Gengai is about to get executed just when Gin shows up huh? The story with Gengai, Katsura and Kondos story was hilarious in how it all tied together. So Sougos a ponytail badass, future Hijikata reminds me of Levi from Shingeki no Kyojin and [Eli is well Eli](http://i.imgur.com/I6vOAyY.gifv) Eli no! Dont get coerced by the mayo!  Now we see how that mystical guy relates to the white plague. Otae! The trio of other badass women are back. Im glad that Saachan got some serious lines in the hospital scene, it really gives her VA sometime in the limelight. This is giving me flashbacks to Mitsubas death. The Odd Jobs are back! I like this Wild West sounding song used during the montage of searching for the Enmi. I love the lighting for the standoff between Gin & the Enmi at the top of the Terminal. Needless to say this fight is awesome looking. Given all these hints it was kind of hard for it not to be Future Gin. 

I like how that collectable film is still relevant. [Now this is what Ive been waiting for!](http://i.imgur.com/F3UyqwG.png) Im still in disbelief about how they took a character from an advert and made it an integral part of the story, but thats Gintama for you. Wait what? Everyones gathered together? This was unexpected but I like it.  [THIS FIGHT!](http://i.imgur.com/qY6A4Lt.gifv) Here I thought that Sakura Mitsutsuki couldnt be topped, then [Gengai Destruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2dKjnmWRkk) happened. *BRING ME DOWN!?* [Just when I thought this couldnt get any more awesome.](http://i.imgur.com/qXo3Rti.png) Back to the meta humour. Takasugis only line in the movie! More Gengai Destruction is not a bad thing. So the OP listed was actually the first OP of the show? [Fin.](http://i.imgur.com/YynVt7U.png)


What a ride that was. It embodied everything that Gintama is into a neat 1hr 50 package. If I made a video with commentary most of it would just be me channelling my inner fangirl with the excessive screaming. After watching everything there is on Gintama (for now) I am glad that I started watching it. If nothing else however I can say that Ive watched a show that has a triple digit episode count which is an achievement to me so yay to me!

> Even though I joined in in the latter half of this re-watch I feel like Ive been taking part in these discussions since the start so I can only guess what it is like for those of you who actually were here from the start.

A few months in a lot of people dropped off so it's mostly been the core group still around now that I remember anyway.

> Can we have a spinoff with these characters?

I was thinking that too! Not sure what kind of show it would be without Gin's crazy antics though.

> Im glad that Saachan got some serious lines in the hospital scene, it really gives her VA sometime in the limelight.

About damn time, too. Too bad her character is mostly a joke, her VA's great.

> Im still in disbelief about how they took a character from an advert and made it an integral part of the story, but thats Gintama for you.

That's one of the things I love about this show because I can't think of anything else like it.

Yes! When *Pray* started playing with all of the clips from previous episodes streaming across the screen I had a continuity nerdgasm. [No, really.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvyyHCLtyjE&t=1h48m15s) (jump to 1:48:15 if it doesn't automatically)

My thought process going in back when the whole thing started: "It's a *really* highly rated series so there has to be some reason for it and I won't watch it on my own because it's *way* too long so it's now or never... and I can always drop it if I don't like it."

I did very nearly drop it in the first couple months but decided to keep going as one of the first-time viewers giving their opinion on things; I enjoy seeing the same with series I love.

So, if you want to hear a giant nerd ramble about the movie and the series as a whole for more than15 minutes: [watch this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwQllia37Ks)

[^(Full reaction video here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvyyHCLtyjE) ^(but I wouldn't recommend watching that since I frequentlygo for stretches of time without anything interesting going on. At least it doesn't appear to be muted yet.)

If you don't want to watch either, this post started as something of a summary of the first video but then grew as I kept thinking of things to add in. I've omitted a few things and added several others, so you'll have to checkout everything, right?

## Gintama: The Movie: The Final Chapter: Yorozuya Forever

Verdict: a good movie and a great Gintama movie. Carries the feeling of the show well, unlike Benizakura which I always thought was a little *too* serious given how the show usually is.

I like the take on the older characters, particularly Kagura ^(and her outfit). As pointed out, her voice actress got to exercise a broader range with the character for once! I really enjoyed that and I kinda wish they'd advance the show a few years so she can do moreof it. Meanwhile I'd be fine with Shinpachi carrying on the straight man routine because, as I frequently state, it's necessary for the humor.

The other characters didn't really have much of a change that was primarily due to age, so they can stay as-is. Poor Catherine though, those "whiskers" do her no good. Same goes for Hasegawa, though his cardboard samurai getup at the end was amusing.Future-Tama is just strange, I'm not a fan of her upgrades.

Hijikata and Elizabeth was a teamup I never expected to see but it was amazing. I do recall seeing a gif of buff Eli in action either back before I started the show or soon after, but I had completely forgotten about it after that so it was quite the surprise. Sougo as an assassin was good and I kinda want to see more of that.

Kyubei and Tsukuyo and Sacchan, oh my! The lastwith a dramatic scene for once, surprisingly. And poor white-haired Otae. Gintoki visiting her in the hospital nearly got to me (or maybe it did, you can verify in the reaction video).I'm glad she came back to kick some ass with her naginata in the past.

Speaking of which, the whole time travel thing was a neat idea, from the camera at the beginning (nice job breaking the fourth wall on your biggest screen yet) to Tama bringing everyone back at the end to defeat the blight. It's a fun way tohavean original plot with big character changes without interfering with continuity (too much).

Addendum: I watched The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya last night. As Gintoki's voice actor is also behind Kyon,the main character in that series, I feellike I should talk about it briefly: [Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya](/s "ANOTHER TIME TRAVEL MOVIE! Completely unintentional timing watching both of them in the same week but I thought it was hilarious. Also hnnnngh Nagato. Haruhi herself would fit well in Gintama, I think, god powers aside. She has the right forceful personality for it.")

## The Series

Hi, my name is Durinthal and I've beenliving with Gintama for the past 10 months. **And it's awesome.**

It definitely took a while for the show to grow on me though. The sukiyaki episode (25) was the first one I really enjoyed but it wasn't until roughly the Benizakura arc that I regularly liked it from episode to episode. After that the misses were few and far between.

It has some of the best female characters inanime and almost no helpless or feeble women (Mitsuba, Kirara, I'm looking at you). Everyone's fair game for humiliation, however.

What really pushed this series over the top and into favorites territory for me is its complete disregard for the fourth wall. A static exterior shot of Odd Jobs with the characters talking about theshow'sbudget for three minutes is *absolutely hilarious* to me. The floating numbers during the entirety of the popularity poll arc was brilliant and likely remains unmatched by any other series.

Even aside from the metahumor, the show was frequently absurd to the point of insanity. Katsurabecoming so consumed by a virus that *he turns into Will Smith anduses Obama's election campaign catchphrase* is still possibly the highlight of the entire series for me.

Interesting that Shinpachi is second place, due you just think he is more important than the show (and its characters) give him credit for? Or do you really like him as a character.

Both, really. He's the level-headed and responsible member of Odd Jobs and keeps the other two grounded, also usually serving as audience surrogate when things get weird. I'm a fan of that kind of character.

I see, very well then :)
>> ARTICLE
Just watched your live reaction of the movie. You seemed a bit confused about why Odd Jobs and Co. travelled back in time to save Gin.

Basically, to erase the past where Gin is infected by the curse (and thus saving the future), Gin, with the help of Tama, travels back in time and eradicates himself, thus ensuring that the carrier of the plague is exterminated. This results in a future drastically different to the one shown earlier, but seeing as Gin died, everything in Gintama never happened. Tama managed to survive the 15 years and reminded Gin's friends of his existence and that he was the one who sacrificed himself to save the future.

In the end, they decided that they'd go back in time (using Tama's time travel capabilities) to find a solution that involves a non-apocalyptic future with Gin in it. I.e. to save Gin.

I did eventually figure that out after thinking back on it, but thanks for laying it out like that. Time travel is stupidly complicated at times.

Whoops, sorry, should be fixed now.
>> ARTICLE
Glad I'm not the only one discussing other shows with time travel elements. They do seem to carry similar ideas - either that or I'm just reading the same thing over and over into them - like getting a character to look inwardly and evaluate what he/she values the most while trying to find a way home. I usually get a sense of dread and discomfort watching a character find his way around a new world, but Be Forever Yorozuya was enjoyable throughout while giving me that same feeling, probably for the takes on older characters that you described.

> Hi, my name is Durinthal and I've been living with Gintama for the past 10 months.

I read this like an introduction at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Yup, I'll back you up on each of your points. Took some time for the show to win me over, but once it did, it just kept building on itself and its little-to-no-pretense-but-honest-sincere-and-hilarious attitude. Ten months well spent, especially with the group.

Just because he deserves another mention: thank you for all the work that you put into the group /u/onurtag! Let it be known that you were responsible for creating new fans through your own passion.

Agreed, time travel plots are often disconcerting as a viewer. Gintama changed the circumstances enough (not just the characters' personalities) that it's different. Also the general humor of the series helps.

165 is the one featuring Gin/Hijikata, right? It's my fave too, though for quite possibly different reasons^they're^my^otp

I have no idea how I do it either. It's more than I've ever written for any single project in my life before now, I'm pretty certain.

There is hope yet! Like you said I would love an OVA of some kind of that future, kind of like what's happening with this Steins;Gate sequel that was announced. Although the shift in tone would be unusual for Gintama whereas S;G had that serious tone all along so it wouldn't be too surprising. 


> ^and ^her ^outfit

Mmm... yep, I agree here. I just forgot to mention it.

>  Benizakura which I always thought was a little too serious

That may explain why I didn't enjoy it as much, it dived in the deep end a little early rather than easing us into it and the contrast was a bit heavy.

> Disappearance Of Haruhi Suzumiya

Nagato is best girl, come at me haters!

I should probably write something like this myself but that will have to wait until later.

I'm conflicted. Nagato's the kind of girl *I'd* like, but Haruhi is such an interesting character to me. Asahina fans are just in it for the plot.

I really didn't pay enough attention to the background music to remember specific tracks all that well.

Without Haruhi the show would not have been half as interesting as it would have.

EDIT: Decided to list my favorite Characters. 



1. Gintoki



2. Sougo



3. Kagura



4. Sakamoto and Mutsu



5. Takasugi



Also I would also like to apologize for always being a bit late to the party, I sleep in too late, 8 am is unreasonable ;)

I'll give you the others but what do you like about Sakamoto? Also good choice for OP/ED.

I always thought Sakamoto was funny but doesn't appear enough. Mutsu is a good "straight man" to his ridiculousness so that's why they are on the same line. There is a manga arc that explains why Mutsu is with the idiot that I hope they get to. I wouldn't put Sakamoto there without Mutsu probably tho.

> If you must resent something, resent your own character

Dang, the sense of loss cuts deep. Kaguras line about Gin coming back hit home hard.

Fantastic fight between Gin & ~~The Blight~~ Gin. Made use of its environment. Great visuals for the sparring. Partially took place on a rooftop  Sorachi bingo would need that square. 

Final Objective: Go back to the Joi Rebellion and kill infected Gin. 

Getting abandoned for the second time.

Just imagine: a 90-120 minute movie with the quality of the battlefield shot detailing the history between Shoyos classroom and the Joi Rebellion. *Drools*

Movie-Pirate-kun = Tama. Fake White Yaksha = Hasegawa. Everyone running support to determine the course of history on this world line. Lets do this!

The concentration of hype of everyone mowing down Amanto is too much.

God dammit Kyuubei & Tojo cant not ruin the mood.

It just keeps getting better: Spyair track backing the charge against the World Breakers while the Shinsengumi and Katsura man the explosives.

Getting a similar feel to [Steins;Gate Episode 22](/s "Kurisus idea that the consciousness / essence of a person transcends the world he/she is bound to if they exist on multiple lines. Its an oddly comforting and even romantic idea to believe that certain people will be drawn to one another regardless of the circumstances that make their worlds differ.")

Ill bear every cross to keep my world intact. Cant leave us without a few one-liners, eh Gin?

Guess the rebels got over their hangovers

Damn, thats a clever incorporation of your key visual

Since when has Tama cared about saving energy?

LOL the opportunism during the paradox disappearance effect

Lol the after-credits scene is basically a late-for-school toast-in-mouth introduction. Perfection <3

*****

If I had watched this before the season 7 announcements, I wouldnt be upset over the Final Chapter business. This was a near two-hour romp of Gintama in its most refined form yet. The self-deprecation and cultural mockery were on-point. The story had with it a layer of sincerity and emotion that Ive come to enjoy from Sorachi. I *am* a sucker for these displays of value and appreciation between characters (if you cant tell from me drawing comparisons with S;G). Sharp, exciting, endearing, hype. It did everything it needed to do as a ~~final~~ sendoff. Bravo Sorachi, Fujita, and Sunrise 5. I await your "shameless return".

One last time. Here we go:

###Crack Ship Corner

Divergence 1.148406
	
Gintoki has succumbed to the White Plague, effectively disappearing. The earth has been evacuated after the initial outbreak of the nanomachine virus. Edo is in a state of decay as a result. 

Rather than starting a succession dispute, Shinpa-san and Kagura-san continue Odd Jobs in Gins stead, providing protection to Kabukicho from rogue gangs and rebuilding Edo with those that stayed behind.

While they arent without grieving Gins loss, their memory of him leaves a determination to see the birth of a nation founded on the soul of a samurai. Maybe then, hell find his way home. But until then, theres work to be done.

Theres little time to idle, but we can still find happiness along the way and even settle down.

Legitimately no joke here, I spit my fucking milk out. Where is this ship? How do I board it? It's sailing, yes? *It could still happen?*

And dammit parameterized, I both fear and envy the effort you put into these comments. It's been fun reading these week after week. 

You'd better be doing this shit in the weekly discussion threads. I don't know if I can handle no more Crack Ship Corner.
>> ARTICLE
On an infinite number of world lines, it could be happening an infinite number of times.

Likewise, fangirlingduck. Your comments gave me a good laugh week in and week out.

The plan for now is some commentary, Time to Dick, and Ship Appreciation. I have 25 listed pairings for now, some crack and some not. I may do Crack Ship Corner every now and then, but I do want to get a feel for how others respond to my...uh...contributions...in the discussion threads.
>> ARTICLE
Finally the one part of Gintama I hadn't already seen! That was a great movie. If I had watched it earlier, it would've been the perfect way to end things until another season is announced.

And since others are doing their top 5s I thought I would too.

Just completed my download of the Bonus Art Album and damn, I've only realize now how risque(and hot) Adult Kagura's clothing are. Dem sex appeals, can't believe it's the same heroine that vomit in the earliest episodes.

4 days baby!!!
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher, reporting for attendance!


>> ARTICLE
just watched the first couple episodes recently, presently surprised by this!
>> ARTICLE
I'm at about episode 120, and I (obviously, if I got to 120) love it. What I've found to be great is that you can watch it at whatever pace you like and not really need to be caught up on a lot. I hope you've got your eyes open for references to anime/manga/video games, because damn there's a lot.
>> ARTICLE
\0

Heard it's good, never was motivated to sit down and watch it all (too daunting). I'm excited for this.
>> ARTICLE
Saw the whole thing, it is my 1# Anime. You guys are gonna love it!!
>> ARTICLE
Same here, I tried a few episodes, but ended up jumping around/not finishing it.
>> ARTICLE
0/

Yeah, me too.  I wasn't motivated at first but then a .gif or video on the front page appeared a while back promoting Gintama for introducing the girl main character.  Watched it, laughed so hard.  Bumped it up on my CR queue.  No ragrats.  These threads will definitely make me focused on consistently watching the show.

On a sidenote: OP!  When are you going to post the rewatch threads?  Like in the morning, afternoon, evening?  Maybe it doesn't matter when but I think it helps to know a generalization of when it gets up.
>> ARTICLE
This week its saturday so I'll probably post it around 6-7 pm for EU so people from NA can join when it is still hot.  
>> ARTICLE
I am at episode 20, so I'll wait for you guys to catch up.

Then we can all enjoy it together :D!
>> ARTICLE
A tip for people who watch it for the first time: Gintama is well known for its slow start, the first 24 episodes are basically all character introduction episodes. It really starts to kick off later on, so stay strong and sit through the mediocrity until you reach the gold
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, also the first two episodes might be a little confusing because they show a lot of characters without first introducing them. But the introductions start at episode 3 so your confusion will be gone by then.
>> ARTICLE
Cool. I was looking for a reason to rewatch it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in! I've had the series on hold for years now, despite how good it turned out.  
>> ARTICLE
Let's do it. I'm in! 
>> ARTICLE
Oh been wanting to watch Gintama
>> ARTICLE
I'm a first time watcher in the mid-80s. Might as well just rewatch it!

Suggestion? To help people stay motivated watching such a long show, if the mods don't have an issue with it maybe make a mid-week/Wednesday post reminding people what episodes will be discussed each weekend. 
>> ARTICLE
I would like to post something in the middle of the week to remind people but I don't really want to post the week's schedule again.  
It would be good with a new idea though. 

Maybe we can do something like a best gif/screenshot contest and we can announce the winners in the middle of the week.  

I'll think about it. I'm sure someone would get a nice idea by saturday so we can get it going.
>> ARTICLE
Having a gif/screenshot contest would be fantastic! You could mention the contest on Saturday and then say you're going to post the results on Wednesday. It's a perfect reminder of what we're going to be watching!
>> ARTICLE
That would be great. I was gonna try and learn how to make gifs/webms if* this was actually going to happen, guess I better start. [Made the first one!](http://www.gfycat.com/ZealousFixedCanvasback#)
>> ARTICLE
I've watched the entire series but I might just join you guys. Legitimately miss Gintama and awaiting its return so might just use this to hold me over.

Gintama starts off slow as people have said but by the "end" of the series I have honestly considered it one of the best animes of all time. Love it to death.
>> ARTICLE
Liking the sounds of this. I'm in
>> ARTICLE
Been on episode 4 for a while just wasn't motivated to keep watching but this sounds like fun I'll definitely give it another shot!
>> ARTICLE
As I said in the original post, this has been on my watch list for a long time and I've just been needing a push to start watching it. Count me in!
>> ARTICLE
Hi i'm new to this subreddit, is this the anime club I've heard about. I really want to re-watch this show and discuss it, how do i get involved with this marathon thing! Sorry for the "nooby" question, but I nerd out for this show and would love to discuss all it entails with people!
>> ARTICLE
Weekly threads will be posted, which is where we'll be able to discuss the set episodes. You don't need to do anything special to join in, just post any comments you have in the corresponding thread! 
>> ARTICLE
I'm in. I've read a bit of the Manga and didn't know there was an Anime till recently. 
>> ARTICLE
On my list for ages, finally going to start.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you so much, I wanted to watch it so bad, but it would be really boring without discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I've never watched this show and I know barely nothing about except that it's good. I was planning to watch it, so I'll probably join in on this. 
>> ARTICLE
I did just finish the series in March, but I guess I'm due for a rewatch. Should be even more fun with the discussions
>> ARTICLE
3 episodes in! Guess I picked a good time to start!
>> ARTICLE
I guess I have a reason to start watching Gintama now.
>> ARTICLE
The best thing i love about this is the fact that newcomers and old viewers are gonna check it out again, hence raising popularity and that only brings good things! Imma join this and have hopefully have a great time!
>> ARTICLE
I've never even heard of it until I saw the post earlier about re-watching it with discussion. I'm new to watching simulcasts and taking part in discussions so I will be taking part in this as well as a first time watcher! If you all say it's good then I'll take your word for it and add it to my crunchy roll queue. I look forward to the discussions each week!
>> ARTICLE
Another first-time watcher, gonna give it a try tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks /u/onurtag for the great post.
>> ARTICLE
I've been wanting to watch this for ages, looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in.
>> ARTICLE
I got this series a couple of months ago and hadn't gave it a chance, so excited to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
it is so amazing. I am so happy to see this! Get ready to laugh, a lot!
>> ARTICLE
Still on the fence about this. :/

On the one hand I'd really love to watch the show with you guys, but I don't know if I can fit 4 episodes a week into my schedule. I'll probably end up staying behind and not having any fun.
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, I've always looked at Gintama from a far, but never planned to watch it. Now that I have an excuse, I'm in.
>> ARTICLE
gotta build my street cred im in '
>> ARTICLE
I heard so much about this show and tried to watch it last year, but came to a stop a couple of episodes in. I'll tag along for this, you lot should make it a lot more fun. Are we doing the second season as well?
>> ARTICLE
As long as at least a single person is here with me I'll keep going until the end
>> ARTICLE
Alright. I'm down. 
>> ARTICLE
Woohoo! I've wanted to watch it but never really had the motivation. 
>> ARTICLE
First time viewer here. The first four episodes were a bit of hit-or-miss for me. But when it hit, it hit really well. Hearing how it gets much better over time, I'm really excited for when it's hit after hit after hit.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I may as well give it a try. I watched the first episode months ago but the episode number was too daunting for me so I dropped it. Participating in this and only watching a few episodes a week will really help keep it from being overwhelming.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in! I've tried to get some of my friends to watch it but they couldn't get passed the first few episodes. It'll be nice to be able to have some discussion with you guys! 
>> ARTICLE
Hey guys Im totally down to join you guys on this! BTW, um what is the general consensus for Gintama? I see that it has really high Mal scores, but i dont really see people talking about it like they do for other really good shows like Madoka or Geass or something. And I never see people say Gintama is their defining anime experience.
>> ARTICLE
Well what I did was unless the person was a close friend I didn't even mention gintama's name. Some things you gotta keep for yourself :)  

At least this was what I thought, I don't really know the reason.
>> ARTICLE
 I think that would be awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
Well we'll see if people agree to it. Someone has to make the threads for each week and decide the amount of episodes to watch. Hoping the mods approve it if a lot of people want it.
>> ARTICLE
There is a /r/gintama is there not?
>> ARTICLE
The mods don't need to approve anything, you can just do it yourself. 

Make a self post and announce what you want to do; if people like the idea then they'll tell you. Then just decide how it's laid out, and make the discussion threads. Nothing to it. /u/AnimeClub does it all the time, in fact you could message them if you want and ask about an official Anime Club Gintama re-watch. (It would have to voted on and stuff though, and it would be quicker to just do it yourself)
>> ARTICLE
I mean I'm not really a regular poster, I thought someone more "official" would agree to post it. I've seen people write great reviews here and threads for such things. They could probably do a better job than me. It was just an idea.
>> ARTICLE
From the very beginning? That sounds great. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah from the very beginning to the end. Movies and everything in order.
>> ARTICLE
I've been meaning to start the series for a little while now, so I'd be down to have a weekly thread where I could read what others thought of the episode!
>> ARTICLE
Is Gintama a spoilery kind of show? Other shows that are airing or have aired that had some source material had spoilers left and right in the discussion threads. You can't distinguish between genuine speculation and people pretending to speculate. In this case, it would be people who have already seen the show and are rewatching.
>> ARTICLE
The spoiler tag can be used for any future developments in the following episodes but speculation or guessing for first time watchers can be ok.
>> ARTICLE
I would like it even if speculation was tagged as spoiler. It prevents the aforementioned case where people pretend to speculate. Personally, hearing some speculation can make me deduce what's actually going to happen, so most of the time I don't like to see it.
>> ARTICLE
Unlike most other titles gintama is an episodic anime so I am sure there won't be many spoilers around
>> ARTICLE
Well, I hope it would be similar to the Toradora Re-watch that happened in December where people would post solely their thoughts on the episode or how nostalgic it was for them. Of course, I am prepared to have some things spoiled for me, but I've never cared much about them.
>> ARTICLE
Down.  It's been about a year since I finished it and have been meaning to rewatch it again.

One of my all time favorites and an instant classic in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah! I started it a few weeks ago and I've loved it so far, though I'm only through the first few episodes. Sign me up!
>> ARTICLE
I would be up for it, even though I am on about episode 10 of my first time through.

Edit: Finally re-checked my Crunchyroll status for this, I am on episode 15 and the last two were really starting to get good!
>> ARTICLE
First time watching and am on 18.
>> ARTICLE
i didn't even start yet :/
>> ARTICLE
Now would be a good time to start!
>> ARTICLE
You're in for a hell of a ride. And I'd say the anime wasn't even remotely close to hitting it's stride at episode 10. It just gets better from there, have fun!
>> ARTICLE
They have had some moments so far,  I am excited to see this show when it gets going! 
>> ARTICLE
I'm on like 6 :X
>> ARTICLE
Have never watched Gintama but I have heard nothing but good things from it. I've been meaning to give it a go recently, so count me in!
>> ARTICLE
Don't think about it. [Just do it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeINRQbfV0Q)
>> ARTICLE
The beginning is very slow, but after 30 episodes you will be addicted to it. Best main protagonist ever.
>> ARTICLE
well, I just finished gintama two days ago.  Yet, now I've got a new reason to rewatch the series :D.
>> ARTICLE
This would be a pretty large commitment, but I would try my best to keep up, Gintama is worth at least a few re-watches.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I'm already ahead of you but I'd love to see what you think. I'm about 90 episodes in and absolutely LOVING IT. The anime has a slower start, but once you get all of the characters figured out they're used to such crazy potential it's unreal.

I really got into it once I got to Benizakura. Benizakura was amazing and I couldn't get enough.

Gintoki really is one of my favorite protagonists too. There's so much behind him.

I might add that most of my favorites are the manga adapted arcs. As I said before, Benizakura, Detective Hard Boiled, Sogou's Sister, Yagyu, Hasegawa Prosecution, and Fuyo arcs (in no specific order) were definitely the best in the first 100 episodes that I've seen. That isn't to say skip the "filler" (not the best word for it) because most are good but some are hit and miss.
>> ARTICLE
gintama has only around 20-25 episodes of filler in 275 total episodes(and I don't remember any bad one) so I think we will be fine with not skipping anything  
edit: forgot to close paranthesis
>> ARTICLE
Yeah no don't skip a thing I'm just saying the comedy can be hit or miss sometimes when it's a one-off episode. The longer arcs are better IMO comedy wise.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is one of the shows I've been thinking about watching for the first time. Count me in!
>> ARTICLE
A great idea! It has been a while since I finished watching gintama and I was also looking forward to rewatching it. 
  
We definitely can't take a break between the episodes of an arc. Good thing that they are mostly short (2-3 episodes) and we won't have to seperate them.  If we reach one of the big arcs (5 to 8 episodes) we will discuss it at that time.
 
here is the arcs list: http://www.yorozuyasoul.com/gintama/arcs  
I checked it and it doesn't seem like they missed an arc  

also here is the episode list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gintama_episodes  
another episode list: http://gintama.qwikwiki.com/en/Gintama_Episode_List/Season_1  

We will make a new post with a google docs survey (tomorrow) asking people how many episodes per week they want to watch and maybe which day (saturday-sunday-friday?)  


>> ARTICLE
No one has contacted me so far but you, and I was thinking about making a survey thread at first.  Both of those questions seem fine the people in /r/Gintama are up for it too.   
  
After the results of the poll (how long will it last ?) - we can announce the results in the thread and post the the number of episodes to watch the first week.    
  
Also in the text of the thread post the sequence of the episodes (all of them, every part and movie etc - a link ? ) and make an optional question if they're ok with how we've divided up the episodes per week (story arcs).  
  
As far the title, It can be "Gintama Group Watch - Survey" for the first one. Then the official Gintama thread can be like "Weekly Gintama - Episodes A - B "   
  
If the mods make it an official post. That'd be even more awesome.  
  
*Apologies for any grammatical errors.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds Great I'm up for it!! Hoping for another season soon
>> ARTICLE
Have just finished watching every episode. But am happy to start again, one of the good features of a long running show is that by the time you get to the end you have forgotten how it began :)
>> ARTICLE
I'm in, sounds like fun!
>> ARTICLE
You should post this on /r/gintama too.
>> ARTICLE
Just did [that](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gintama/comments/279znz /thinking_about_starting_a_weekly_thread_to/). Didn't know Gintama had a separate sub.
>> ARTICLE
I read chapter 1 last night so I guess I'm in.
>> ARTICLE
I'm okay with this. When will it begin?

And for the episodes, sometimes the stories are episodic or goes into an arc. For the episodic stories, I think 2 or 3 episodes per week are sufficient. For the arc, either take 2 per week or marathon it.
>> ARTICLE
Saturday I guess ? Post a starting thread , sort of announce the beginning. I haven't seen all the episodes so someone will help me sort out how to divide them between weeks and my guess is most people will choose to marathon those arcs if they aren't too long.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to help sorting but I'm gonna be busy around these two weeks. You can check the previews, IIRC they have a reminder that the next episode is going to be arc story.
>> ARTICLE
I'm down. someone tell me when stuffs happening.
>> ARTICLE
Would love to do this. I would organise and create threads but unfortunatley im Australian so Everything would be at awkward times, better it be a North american to post it.
>> ARTICLE
Just started watching Gintama last night and I would love a weekly thread!
>> ARTICLE
How many episodes per week?
>> ARTICLE
Are rewatch threads a common thing? I'd totally be up for rewatch threads!
>> ARTICLE
That would be awesome. I have been wanting to watch the whole thing for a while now and this is the perfect motivation.

I second this notion. :)
>> ARTICLE
Be the change

I would also join, but not as rewatching but watching it for the first time. been trying to get into it a few times, but never could really
>> ARTICLE
Why not.

This will be a good chance for me to start Gintama, so I hope it happens!

[I love this idea, I'm game.](http://i3.minus.com/ibtrgCPQ8Qe26d.png)

I say we do 12 episodes a week. Starting next week.

Am I going to have to go buy some Anpan and strawberry milk? because I mean I will and I love Gintama and strawberry milk, never had Anpan though.
>> ARTICLE
Just, don't do a stakeout on Anpan.
>> ARTICLE
Count me in too
>> ARTICLE
Oh, this is so perfect! Have been wanting to rewatch Gintama for a very long time now. My summer holidays just started as well, so the timing is great!
>> ARTICLE
I would be up for this definitely.
>> ARTICLE
Never watched Gintama but I'd been meaning to get around to it. It took me two tries to watch the first two episodes only to find out they were filler, so I took a break from it. Was also gonna just read the manga on my phone but the app messed up and I had to delete it. I planned to give it another try after I caught up in glorious glorious Kingdom (on chp 200) But then I watched Gundam Build Fighters and really wanted to watch Gundam.

Needless to say this will get my shit straight if this comes to fruition. I only ask that people place spoiler tags in the discussion so that first timers like me don't have to worry about veteran watchers fangasming over whats to come.
>> ARTICLE
That would be great. But i would prefer if we watched more than 1 episode per week. I would rather have every day, or every other day!
>> ARTICLE
I'd definitely be up for it. I've only heard good things about it, and have just never had a reason to watch, but this'll give me a good kick in the pants to do it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm in! I never really get the oportunity to start watching it so this is really good!. 
>> ARTICLE
I have been thinking about watching it this sounds like a good idea.

Damn that looks really good.

Completely agree she also has some other amazing gintama fan art worth taking a look.

Holy shit, this artwork is really good! Always love artwork featuring Gintama characters.

Wow, looks really great, love how some of the named side-characters^2 are included!

Love the Shinsengumi, they're some of the strongest Gintama characters which is saying a lot.

He's at the right side. Leaning on the wall.

[For those who don't understand the reference for Gin-chan's outburst.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_A0GigrQl0)

For context:

In July 2014, Ryutaro Nonomura was on the news as a politician who was spending government money for his own personal expenses. He had an outburst at the press conference when asked about the situation, and the video of him was all over the Japanese news for a good few weeks.

Edited: context 
>> ARTICLE
I've tagged you as TL-notes Gintama, surely you'll deliver for the rest of  the episodes too ? ... right ? please .... waaaaah :'(
>> ARTICLE
Gintama references so much that sometimes I don't even know what's going on haha. Not to mention it airs at 3:30 am for me...

But I can try!! 
>> ARTICLE
God speed. As someone who's read the manga, I can honestly say that there's actually an impossible amount of references. It's a lot harder in anime, where you don't have the actual spelling and a freeze frame on every page, but the manga has a T/N on every other page, at least. So far the adaptation seems to be alright at pulling out the most hilarious ones though (namely Ketsuno Ana's kestsunoana).
>> ARTICLE
Haha thanks! I was laughing so hard I had trouble breathing the first time Ketsuno-ana was introduced. That was really something else.

The anime IS a bit more difficult but I think it should be fine. I've been reading the manga as well so I can always go back to the source and check out the tl-notes from there too, if I have too much trouble. That being said, being bilingual in Japanese should also help out, and I'm usually trying to keep up with current trends in TV culture!

He sure was... He's resigned now. He's also paid back all of the government funds that he was accused of using for personal expenses so that's good too ~~even though he wouldn't have had to if he didn't use them in the first place~~.

To the people wondering **"Sunrise isn't making in anymore!?"**, it's still basically the same company. Sunrise is under the Bandai Namco umbrella, and BN just made a new studio/company branching off of Sunrise to make a more family-friendly and/or high-target series.

BN Pictures is completely made up of the same people from Sunrise, so it's just the same studio with a different name.

The Sunrise/BN relationship is basically like the Production IG/WIT one.

so basically it free's up sunrise's time to make more Gundam and Mecha's?

GINTAMA IS BACK, TEARS OF JOY 

I cant wait for all the funny arcs and I cant wait for all the serious arcs, a year ago I gave up hope that it would come back and now its back !!
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait to get home and watch it! 
>> ARTICLE
If we learned one thing from Gintama is that you should never give up hope and here it is, a fantastic new season is awaiting us.
>> ARTICLE
indeed, I spent the entire week re watching all my favorite arcs and I am hyped as ****
>> ARTICLE
Also never ever trust their "final episode" bullshit. They are pulling this every season :P
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure the "continue the show even after airing a final episode" thing was a joke from season 1. I can't recall from which exact episode though :|
>> ARTICLE
They've been making the joke of losing money, blacking put an episode to save animation costs, making fun of the producers etc. It's all great. 
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention the live action episode and segments, plus the static background episode every 50 or so episodes. This show certainly takes meta to a whole 'nother level.
>> ARTICLE
The king is back.
>> ARTICLE
Getting to watch a currently airing Gintama anime is pretty awesome.
 
Psycho-Pass!
>> ARTICLE
Gintama returned, and it was everything I thought it could be. The world is right again.

Edit: Also Gintama is now 5 of the top 10 rated anime series on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not gonna lie, I was one of the people who rated it a 10/10 before it even started.

It's such a perfect show. 
>> ARTICLE
Haha I don't blame you, I managed to at least wait to watch the first episode before giving it 10/10 though! I was very proud of myself for my self control!
>> ARTICLE
Well, that didn't take long. With rating 9.28 right now, the new Gintama sits at the very top #1 of MAL after only one episode. http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php
>> ARTICLE
Ahaha I love it! I cannot wait for the saltiness from people about it being #1 when its just started airing.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it got its score despite a lot of salty score_1 trolls, to there's that.
>> ARTICLE
Will Hasegawa ever catch a break. A hilarious first episode definitely worth waking up early.
>> ARTICLE
Gori sensei said that the sign of gintama end is when hasegawa catch a break

Welp, sorry then Madao. You gonna suffer for *quite a while*.

It's not like I was waiting up all night for you or anything Gintama-senpai.

The bad part of Gintama airing at this time: Westerners get screwed over.

The good part: it means Gintama is airing on a primetime time slot in Japan (~~7:30~~ 6:00 p.m.), so the characters won't have to complain about business going downhill. The reason most other anime air at convenient times for us is because they air late night in Japan. Happy to know Gintama got a nice one.
>> ARTICLE
Actually at 6pm in Japan, which is kind of a weird time imo but better than late night for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's still a great timeslot compared to most anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's be real here, Gintoki will still complain.
>> ARTICLE
>Let's be real here, *Shinpachi* will still complain.

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
"Ahh, we finally got a prime time slot again...I feel like I'm walking on glass now. Everybody's watching us. We make one slip-up like we always do, we're getting bumped right back, I just know it. Ahhh, it's too much pressure. I never asked for this crap. Just air Gintama at 3 AM so I can get drunk and play pachinko."

Apologizing for bringing it back.  
I fucking love this series.

And... the show is already [ranked at number nine for the top anime on MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php). :P
>> ARTICLE
It's ranked at number one now...
>> ARTICLE
Now it's number one!!!
>> ARTICLE
a lot of people on reddit seem to hate Gintama
>> ARTICLE
Because they couldn't get over the weak beginning. Too many casual people here, who started watching anime late with SAO, AoT, Steins;Gate etc.

The Sao + Titan brigade has been the bane of my existence the past 2 years.

Buddy... This is bait.  Don't bother arguing in the future and biting the hook, just call it out as bait.
>> ARTICLE
Anime or Manga? Because if he's talking about the anime, with only one episode like wtf? 

I'm trying to catch up on Gintama, I'm only at episode 20, can I watch this series at the same time or should I just finish catching up first? 
>> ARTICLE
Finish catching up first. Though there is not *really* a continuous story line, there's still a continuous story line. They do piggy back on older things so if you skip, you may miss the joke.
>> ARTICLE
There are some relevant characters that are introduced quite late. Kaguya's brother and Tsukuyo come to mind. (Like episode 100+ late).
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I'll keep catching up for now then! Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
We both read the manga and I can assure you that Shoukgeki doesn't even compare to Gintama in epicness, humour and drama.

I recently rewatched the whole Gintama series and I felt that the first ~38 episodes were really painful, but it slowly starts to ramp up after that. So keep it up, it will be worth it. The arcs are just getting better and better and shit is going down atm in the manga.

You can watch it now with no big problems, but you will miss lots of background information regarding the characters. You can try to skip the fillers if the anime is too slow for you. The Gintama wikia have them listed I believe.
>> ARTICLE
Well if starting episode 38 it gets better I'll watch through it all, I've enjoyed all of the episodes up until now :) Thanks! 
>> ARTICLE
Episode 25 is probably my favorite stand alone episode to date.


>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah the hotpot episode! That was one of best episodes of the early seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Like I said, still one of my favorite eps. if not my most favored. Haven't seen the brand new episode, because I'm not sure if I want to wait week after week, or rage the whole season when its done :) The ghost hot spring arc is hilarious as well as the shogun episodes. But hey those are just my two cents.
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree, I loved these too. Poor shogun gets abused a lot in this series!
>> ARTICLE
God forbid someone has different opinions, right?
>> ARTICLE
How is shokugeki no soma 'hands down better' than gintama? I mean that guy must be nuts or he is into ecchi and foodgasms. :V
>> ARTICLE
what's the point in comparing Gintama with Shokugeki? they are different show genre
>> ARTICLE
SAO has horrible dialogue, as well as acting. And that fucking loli pos character could have been the bane of my existence all by herself. 'Mommy, daddy' . Fucking seriously? Not to mention the story is pretty horrid as well. Especially after the first season.
>> ARTICLE
I stopped 5 minutes before Ep 14's ending. 

>> ARTICLE
Sao and AoT are just at completely different levels. I think it's just the premise of Sao that got it so popular.
>> ARTICLE
So, basically what I am reading is: "***stop liking what I don't like!!!***"
>> ARTICLE
MMM, its more comparable to an experienced movie critic seeing classic films like the godfather and then some kids come along and say transformers 3 is the greatest film ever made and become the annoying vocal voice in the anime world. That's been the past 2 years. 
>> ARTICLE
it's more like someone who's been around for longer and just criticizes based on what they began watching, different strokes for different folks
>> ARTICLE
nah there's plenty of new anime that are good. Its just the overhyped "standard at best" anime of the past 2 years have caused a depressing new generation to exist. 
>> ARTICLE
IMO Gintama is overhyped as well.  
Also, you don't think it's good that anime is getting a bigger, wider audience? More recognition is only good. Doesn't matter you don't like the content that is bringing in more people.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama isn't known by anyone who isnt pretty heavily into anime. And Gintama has the merit of being a long as fuck show somehow managing to just get funnier and better as time goes on. It started fairly weak compared to where it is now.

Attack on Titan has had more kids jacking off about how great it is at every related opportunity. 

I'd rather good anime become popular vs mediocre anime doing so.
I love anime, but I love anime for when its great and compelling. To see stuff I deem, along many other experienced anime goers as bad, getting the hype is just depressing. 

Its like some kid claiming mcdonalds has the best cheeseburger in the world. It doesn't matter if they know the joy of a cheeseburger if what they are eating is low-grade nonsense. 


>> ARTICLE
I hate the "weak beginning" myth.  What it means is that the show is an 8.5/10 until about episode 30, then a 9/10 until episode 60, then a 9.5/10 until about episode 90, then a 10/10 all the way through the end of the original run (episode 201), all the way through Gintama', and then all the way through Enchousen. Fans of Gintama should just stop saying this when describing the show.
>> ARTICLE
I started anime with AoT, but I'm very glad I found Gintama. It's great for just picking up and watching, and you don't need to follow the storyline closely, and there's a giant dog, and yeah.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah all hail the giant dog! Don't forget the cute robot girl, she is actually best girl in this series :P
>> ARTICLE
I'm on the pixelation side arc right now... forget 3d girls, 2d is the way to go.
>> ARTICLE
It's not even a weak beginning.  The show is just really hard to get into.  Honestly, I never felt like the quality permanently picked up anywhere in those 201 episodes.  It wasn't until the 2011 run where things got consistently good.  

In the original run, some episodes were great, and some were boring to me. The beginning was just to see if I had the patience for the show. 
>> ARTICLE
Glad that it worked in the end. This series is amazing despite the inconsistency.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on episode 8 right now and I don't understand why people consider the beginning to be weak. It's pretty damn funny so far.
>> ARTICLE
When compared with the rest of the series, it's weak. When compared with almost anything else, it's pretty awesome.

Keep watching, it gets better and never really stops getting better!
>> ARTICLE
I was in the same boat. I was actually reluctant to start the show because reddit told me the first 60 episodes or so are crap. I started liking the show within the first few episodes, and now I'm on episode 110 and absolutely adore every bit of it.
>> ARTICLE
>weak beginning

It's the weakest part, but I didn't think it's weak.
>> ARTICLE
I found it not that great, but ofc preference differ.
>> ARTICLE
I always had the feeling that Gintama was hard to fully enjoy if your not Japanese, since they reference a lot of Japanese pop culture and subtitles can't usually fully translate the jokes made, so that was why  a lot of westerners didn't liked it. But hey, Japanese American here. Love the show. No anime makes me laugh and give me the feels as much as this.
>> ARTICLE
There's one part in the show where Gin is trying to explain something and Kagura responds: "we can't spend our time worrying about the foreign market half of our Japanese audience doesn't even get the references we are making". 
>> ARTICLE
Classic Gintama. Thats why I love the show xD
>> ARTICLE
Now number one.

>> ARTICLE
The hype is real =))

edit: we got rank 1, time to celebrate yuhuu!
>> ARTICLE
Also pays to mention that gintama as a series holds 5 out of the top ten slots. Half of all good anime is actually GINTAMA.
>> ARTICLE
Only a matter of time until we get the whole top 10 under our control. Just needs 2 more movies and a few more seasons muhahaha.
>> ARTICLE
I must say, what cracked me up the most was that random, realistic, and perfect loud cough during the silence before Gintoki arrived for the press conference.

I feel it falls to the same category as Sougo's random, realistic, and perfect slip in episode 220, which also made me lmao.
>> ARTICLE
shows need more instances like that, just random perfectly normal human flaws that have nothing to do with the plot. 
>> ARTICLE
Completely agree.
>> ARTICLE
I must admit I replayed Sougo's random, realistic, and perfect slip many more times than I should've. It was the perfect finishing moment to an already hilarious episode.
>> ARTICLE
That [entire scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSDF8YyRz80) in 220 made me cry from laughing.
>> ARTICLE
Viewers new to Gintama should not be starting with this, correct? I just started watching Gintama the other day, I am only on episode 2 (of the original series). I should watch that first, yes? Thanks!!
>> ARTICLE
Yes this is actually episode 266, you are still free to watch both if you want to join us in the weekly discussion :P
>> ARTICLE
You should've skipped the first 2 episode as they're pilot. Gintama starts on episode 3.
>> ARTICLE
I should probably start watching Gintama....
>> ARTICLE
Do it, pull through the weak beginning and greatness will be awaiting you.
>> ARTICLE
Can I skip the beginning? I'm not the type of person who can slog (e:accidentally this word) through 20-40 episodes of weakness to get to greatness. 
>> ARTICLE
Start with episode 38 then. These are some important story arcs of the series, but I recommend you to just start from episode 38.

* Umibouzu Arc  (Episodes 40-42)
* Benizakura Arc  (Episodes 58-61)	
* Yagyuu Arc  (Episodes 76-81)
* Shinsengumi Mutiny Arc  (Episodes 101-105)
* The Blaze of Yoshiwara Arc  (Episodes 139-146)
* Red Spider Arc  (Episodes 177-181)	
* Four Devas Arc  (Episodes 210-214)	
* Courtesan of a Nation Arc (Episodes 257-261)
>> ARTICLE
You can technically start anywhere because most of it doesn't reference anything else, but you might get confused by the sheer amount of characters. 

I literally started watching Gintama by ctrl+f "Shinsengumi" on Gintama's episode summary page on Wikipedia. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude, the first episodes are not weak; people say that because compared to the rest of Gintama, the first episodes are weak, but they are very good.

I think the problem arises from the fact that the first episodes have no semblance of a story, and it's basically an introduction arc to the massive cast of characters. A lot of people may say that the show gets better by episode 50 or 60, but that's only because the first "serious" arc (almost nothing is 100% serious in Gintama) takes place around those numbers.

If you skip the beginning, you'll miss a lot of character introductions, which leads to not getting some of the jokes further on. If you want to watch Gintama for the serious arcs and the action, you're doing it wrong, because those are just bonuses to the real fort of this show: the comedy.
>> ARTICLE
I really do want to but i couldn't even comeplete the first episode. Is it like One piece where they say you need to watch like 100 episode, because that is beyond stupid.
>> ARTICLE
Start from Episode 3.
>> ARTICLE
100 episodes? Wtf

The Arlong park arc should be the point where you'd know if you'd like it or not. That starts at episode 30 and ends around 42.
>> ARTICLE
It took me 200 to start liking it
>> ARTICLE
That's around the foxy arc and end of G8 isn't it? Idk. I liked the show from episode 1 but I don't think a person has to wade through hundreds of episodes they hate in order to like it.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's one of the few advantages of having a no drop policy.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly skip episode 1 and 2, they are anime original and don't follow the manga and are not chronological with the rest of the story. The story actually starts at episode 3 and it will make a lot more sense as it actually shows how the main characters meet and it isn't just a bunch of random people you don't know about thrown together.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah nobody can force you to do that. 

If you really can't bring yourself to drag through the start, you could just start from episode 40 with the Umibozu Arc. Episode 38 and 39 were very entertaining episodic episodes too. Don't miss out episode 25 though, it was the hotpot episode and is belonging to one of the best comedy episodes.

The series from there is getting much more consistent until Episode 58, which is the beginning of the first serious story arc. 

The arcs getting more common after that and the comedy also improves a lot as the series progresses.
>> ARTICLE
My rule for introducing people to Gintama is to have them watch up to at least 25. That episode hooked me into the series and from then on it only gets better.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is there are many series that are great in just 25 or less episodes. Some people say it gets good even later, around episode 40 or so. Really difficult to go through that.
>> ARTICLE
It really is a big hurdle for a lot of people to go through which is why I'm surprised Gintama fandom has grown as much as it did. Of course I'm ridiculously happy because I love this show but I know how it is.

But perhaps think of it this way? You're watching one or two average anime but you get the equivalent of ten great 24 ep anime in return for sticking to it. 
>> ARTICLE
I keep seeing this referenced.  What is considered to be the "weak beginning", and when does it end?  I'm at episode 20 right now.
>> ARTICLE
How do you feel about it right now? Honestly there is no specific end to the 'weak beginning', it just slowly gets better until it becomes amazing. So somewhere along the way you may vaguely start viewing it as 'good', and then 'great', and then 'perfection' :P If you find 20 decent right now it should get pretty good for you soon?
>> ARTICLE
Just watch it if you like it as it is now, imo I started to enjoy it at episode 38, but episode 25 was one great episode inbetween.

Later there will be lots of great story arcs, which are one better than another.
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't weak, just confusing. My poor casual mind couldn't take it at the time. I'll try again once my academic year is over.
>> ARTICLE
Imo it's lacking compared to the rest of the series. Rewatching the first episodes was painful for me lol.
>> ARTICLE
What's your opinion on Sunrise to BN Pictures?
>> ARTICLE
I had no clue about the change until Gin's apology. I didn't even now [Bandai Namco] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gintama%C2%B0_episodes) had an anime division, this makes the OVA that much funnier. But the transition seems to be smooth as it very much still feels like Gintama.

>> ARTICLE
Sunrise is a subsidiary of Bandai Namco, the BN Pictures studio is just another (of the many) Sunrise studios -> specialized for shows airing on family friendly timeslots .

change of the animation studios is a lot less of a deal like for instance Log Horizon (Satelight to Deen) .
>> ARTICLE
I asked the same thing, apparently its basically sunrise under another name (for money purpose or whatever?) like its a spinoff studio with most of the same people there apparently!
>> ARTICLE
ah that's nice to know then
>> ARTICLE
that's all that really matters pretty much. animation and everything seems to be fine. it's not like it's what happen with Log horizon and minami-ke when a different studio picks it up.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama once again proved that its the best Anime out there
>> ARTICLE
Its been a while since I laughed this hard. I also really glad they kept all the old music and sound effects.
>> ARTICLE
I was searching for Audio Highs in the OP and they are there, Gintama will have its awesome OST once again.

Oh my god, the intro already cracks me up. That awkward silence prior the press conference was perfect.

###Presumptuous Intro

Howdy, guys. Im one of the faithful of /u/onurtags [Weekly Rewatch Group](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MGJP6AiW8ler_qgLxdsf9OEIbqhJ49MzlBysr-UtU1Y/edit#gid=0) that recently finished. Gintama has been a staple of my day since last June, and has become one of my favorites over that time. Engaging with the show, our group, and the community at large has been a joy. Easily the most receptive and enthusiastic fanbase out there. I look forward to sharing my style of "contribution" with you. [Lets go!](http://i.minus.com/ibiJiFi661u8NC.gif)

*****

Fucking legendary cold open. Its what I imagine happens every time a producer apology to the PTA is mentioned. *PSYCHO-PASS*!

Digging Day x Day. Very bright opening sequence. Puts a smile on my face.

Odd Jobs has slipped through the cracks of time. *Cue Twilight Zone music*

\> Trusting drunken Gin with the Universal Clock and the flow of time

First Lecture Mode of the season: Time is all about perspective.

Chibi Odd Jobs time platformer. I can die happy.

[Dick Entry  13:52  Gintoki  Gintoki](http://i.imgur.com/iHlYGjj.png). Im just kind of guessing based on the bleeps that this is direct and dirty enough to qualify. If Im wrong, please let me know.

Booger picking is a time intensive activity

Death by SPARKING booger. A fitting way for MADAO to go down.

"Natural" death

What a chill end song. Even with a nighttime setting it still has that same brightness that Im getting from the episode.

*****

###Time To Dick

Documenting the length of time that an episode goes without mentioning male genitalia. [Derived from a similar project for the Roosterteeth Podcast](http://roosterteeth.com/members/journal/entry.php?id=3031003). I started this very late into our watch, so its unfortunately not done. Let me know if youd like to contribute to backlog and Ill block off some episodes for you.

###Ship Appreciation

Showing some love for the finest forms of love in the show. New album and pairing every week. Mega-album for the final episode. Accepting pairing requests. *Crack ships are welcome*.

I love how one of these technically classifies as a spoiler.

Haven't read ahead in the manga, but after scratching my head for a few minutes, I figured it out. I'll label the link and be careful moving forward. Thanks for the catch!
>> ARTICLE
Rewatch group represent! You'd better not stop with the crack ships, parameterized. 

>Gin X Sarutobi

In all the doujin and fan art I've seen of the show, I've come to realise a few things. One, the most popular ship seems to be Hijikata x Gin. Two, they are some talented motherfuckers out there. And three, I've very rarely seen Sacchan in doujin. I'm pretty sure if this show ends on a romantic note, Hasegawa x Gin will happen before Sacchan gets her dream wedding. 
>> ARTICLE
My partner in shipping crime! I figured I shouldn't scare everyone away right out of the gate, but don't fret! I've got some devious stuff cooking, and HijiGin is on my list.
>> ARTICLE
Hasegawa x Gin already *did* happen. Watch episodes 239 and 240.
>> ARTICLE
*Exactly*.

Poor Sacchan. 
>> ARTICLE
> Presumptuous Intro

Hell yeah! We Rewatch group members gotta stick together!

> Puts a smile on my face.

Yeah, it reminds me of [Gintama' OP1](https://vimeo.com/62803006) with the energetic vibe that it has.

> First Lecture Mode of the season

At least with this season keeping up with the various counters will be a lot easier.

> "Natural" death

I think they forgot to add in the extra "Natural by DBZ standards" to that death.

> Sarutobi x Gintoki

Some of those picture were adorable! But nothing stops my ship of Tsukuyo x Gintoki! ^Tsukky ^best ^girl! ^Fight ^^me ^^^haters
>> ARTICLE
Gintoki x Tama OTP. It's in the fucking name.
>> ARTICLE
I'm probably the only guy on earth that ships Otae x Gintoki. That said, Sacchan, Tama, and Tsukuyo (and even Kyuubei though that will never ever happen) are all great too.
>> ARTICLE
Otae has one loyal Gorilla, one shouldn't be too greedy you know ;D.

Tama is definitely best girl in this show.
>> ARTICLE
I have always thought of Tama as the 2nd best girl. But Tsukky beats her, I mean just look at the Red Spider arc. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah man [Tama](http://nsa33.casimages.com/img/2014/03/27/140327035640713003.jpg) all the way.

The bolts he bought for her.

Tama quest arc- he was the basis for the Leukocyte King.

Kintama- she was the only one who remembered him other than Sadaharu

Not to mention her in the movie reminding everyone else of his existence.

Also this quote

>"Gintoki- sama, I know now, no matter what happens to you, you will always be yourself. Did you think if you told me you were running away, I would be angry? I would not be angry. I would only ask for you to take me with you."

Tama is best girl.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously Tama gets unnoticed in this anime so much, but indeed she is best girl.
>> ARTICLE
Gin x Tama is on the list. I've got you covered, man.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I have a crush on Tama. And I thought I was the only one, who noticed her.

That last scene. I literally just can't even

Everything about this season premier was perfect.

The press conference, the new OP, Otose's face, the clock amato, the dialgoue and voice acting, Gintoki's golden opportunity speech, Gengai's death, Hasegawa's death, Hasegawa's 2^nd death, Hasegawa's 3^rd death, motherfucking Piccolo's special beam cannon, the new ED....

Everything.
>> ARTICLE
Have a upvote everyone in this thread, let's celebrate the glorious return of Gintama together!

The new season is out! There is only one series of words I can use to describe Gintama finally coming back.

I woke up early(ier) to watch this! Didn't disappoint at all. A very sincere apology followed by more messing with time. Now there has been timeskip, second movie time meddling and time stop. Of course Madao was in the box. Gintoki's very shonen line would be very shonen if it came from anyone else but him. The OP is catchy and the Justaway fireworks in the ED was a nice touch too. Sakamoto and Katsura being shown together in both... is that a hint to the Joui reunion arc's adaptation?? Wednesday mornings are going to be so fun.
>> ARTICLE
A big part of my life that's been missing has returned. my favorite show is back!
>> ARTICLE
I finished the old episodes not even a month ago and started reading the manga to catch up. I love this anime so much that I'm willing to put reading it on hold just to watch it instead. I love the animation and voices and everything about this show.
>> ARTICLE
The anime is really well-made. One of the few occasions where I prefer the adaption over the source material.
>> ARTICLE
Still have 100 episodes to go of the old seasons, watched this. 0% spoilers. Gotta love Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
This episode didn't happen to have any characters you haven't been introduced to yet (except in the OP), but you should probably catch up before you watch much of this season.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamnit. Okay, 100 episodes, 20 minutes per episode, 2000 minutes, 30 hours. Okay, not that much. *prepares soul*
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I didn't make it on time, I'm still at episode 110.
>> ARTICLE
155 great episodes to go ;D
>> ARTICLE
that press conference was so damn funny
>> ARTICLE
Did the movie really make 1.7 billion yen ?

"So guys should I just start from Naruto shippuden, or do i need to watch the first episodes as well?" Essentially a variation of what people are asking in this thread.

obviously they did since both Madao and the old man were killed by Piccolo this time.

>> ARTICLE
Yes! I have stayed up late for greatness! What a great opening. Edit: [Manga Spoilers](/s "Judging by the last part of the opening do you think we will catch up?")

We have enough material for more than 52 episodes and I doubt [Sorachi](http://i.imgur.com/Wt5584b.jpg) would drag the latest arc for much longer.

He probably really wishes he was a cheesecake right about now.

Being as the mangas still ongoing and based on the previous episode to chapter ratio (about 400 chapters in 265 episodes with 9% filler) I'm hopeful we have two full years of this ahead of us.

That would be too good to be true.
>> ARTICLE
God I love this. So good, and this arc already has me laughing. Got crunchyroll membership just for Gintama. Love it. I'm loving the opening and the ending too.

I feel so spoiled, because I started watching Gintama with the (re)watch group, so I didn't have to wait long for a new season.

That beginning was glorious.
>> ARTICLE
Don't feel spoiled, just bitch like I am that we have to actually wait for the conclusion to the story

Wow best 1st episode of this season (and best series) !
>> ARTICLE

Would get smashed in the face with a chair again.

For anyone that hasn't been paying attention, /u/onurtag finished leading a group discussion of the entire series just this past weekend. A handful of us started the series because of that and now we're ready for the new season!

---
Gintama hype goooooooo!

They're even late starting the new season, wouldn't expect anything less. Apologizing for not ending with the final chapter, nice. Sunrise to something else? Did they change studios?

New OP! It... kinda looks like a hybrid of a few earlier ones or maybe I just watched the others too much.

Otose... froze. Uh oh. At least the important characters are still active. Reminds me of the Futurama episode *Meanwhile* though the concept's been around a lot longer than that.

The Universal Clock! The Watchmen of Time had the wrong person accidentally pick it up, that's for sure. And there's the vomit we've come to expect from the series.

The animation for Gin's idea of moving the clock forward is cute. I like the music during that entire section too.

I knew Hasegawa wouldn't have been in the truck, but did they really need to move him all the way out to the wasteland... where he dies anyway? And then gets shot by someone that's clearly not a Namek or anything.

Welcome back, Gintama! For the first time in the series I have to wait for a week to get the resolution to a story.
>> ARTICLE
> hype goooooooo!

HYYYYYYPE!!! 

> Sunrise to something else? Did they change studios?

I interpreted that as letting their success change who they are or something.

> maybe I just watched the others too much.

Well to be fair they all follow a similar format.

> I have to wait for a week to get the resolution to a story.

Trying to get back into this routine is going to be interesting.
>> ARTICLE
>For the first time in the series I have to wait for a week to get the resolution to the story

It feels weird. Wonder if I'll get used to not watching 6 or 7 episodes in a row. 
>> ARTICLE
Classic Gintama comedy, welcome back. Wednesday is now my favourite day of the week.
>> ARTICLE
Man, that was awesome as expected. The quality even seems to have gone up from Enchousen. I couldn't ask for much more. The opening and ending are both great too! 
>> ARTICLE
finally a new season of gintama! :D 
Psycho pass.
>> ARTICLE
One of thing I noticed is Kagura's eyes are so blue this time around the animation quality has definitely improved

###Arrogant Intro for Arrogant people

I'm fashionably late! But I'm here now.
 
Hi everyone, like /u/parameterized I was one of those who watched the show with /u/onurtag's [Weekly Rewatch Group](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MGJP6AiW8ler_qgLxdsf9OEIbqhJ49MzlBysr-UtU1Y/edit?pli=1#gid=0) However I joined in a bit late so you can't really call me "faithful" as such. Never the less I've enjoyed the banter within this welcoming community and hope that this season will be more of the same.

---
###Episode 266

That outburst came out of nowhere. I watched the proper outburst just before this episode and I almost felt bad for laughing but it is what it is. 

New OP's got that pleasant vibe to it which I like and its colourful! 

For a minute I thought that my video player froze when Otose was frozen.

The Yorozuya trio have transported into a different plane of time! Or something presumptuous sounding like that. 

This is why you don't trust Gin with a Universal Clock that can control time.

[Here begins the puke counter for season 7.](http://i.imgur.com/4AiqisV.png)

I would buy a Gintama platformer game in a heartbeat.

The skit with Ketsuno Ana has reminded me never to drink anything while watching Gintama.

I can sympathize with Gengai a little, getting a booger out can sometimes take a while. Not *that* long however.

A fitting end for MADAO. I like this small scale butterfly effect that's going on here. 

The DBZ references are becoming more blatent by the minute.

The ED is rather cheerful too which is funny given how its nighttime. The Justaway fireworks are the best.

--- 

###Afterthoughts

All I can say here is "Welcome back!". The show didn't lose its touch and to me at least it looks more colourful. Its like I was never away.

EDIT: So the new season is already No.1 on MAL. I guess we should take a picture to remember this moment as I imagine it will eventually drop down a few places.
>> ARTICLE
>You can't really call me faithful

Hunts95. Bruh. I've tagged you as "essay writer". Pretty sure everyone else in the group knew you as that as well. 

I was there since the beginning and I think people judged me as the chick with the weird Hijikata obsession. 


>> ARTICLE
Imagine a MMORPG set in the Gintama universe.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely needs a skill for puking then. I mean that's what the characters do half the time.
>> ARTICLE
As long as a Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon is a purchasable item I'm good.
>> ARTICLE
No, it will be legendary weapon only dropped by the strongest end-boss with 0.54% drop-chance.
>> ARTICLE
also is a 1 time-use event summon.
>> ARTICLE
I think a nose picking counter would be more useful for this particular show.
>> ARTICLE
Who's saying we can't do both? Its a good idea and one that I neglected to think of.
>> ARTICLE
Also /u/Shadoxfix: It's technically season *7* of Gintama, not season 3 for your keywords. Gintama covered seasons 1-4, Gintama' was season 5, then Gintama': Enchousen was season 6.
>> ARTICLE
Keywords are pulled from Crunchyroll, Season 3 is what Crunchyroll calls it. Crunchyroll seems to use a completely different numbering scheme. Episode 1-201 is Season 1. Episode 202-265 is Season 2. Now they have season 3.  
Wikipedia seems to do the same although they split it up in Gintama, Gintama' and Gintama. Where Gintama contains 1-4, Gintama' contains 5 + 6, Gintama is 7.
>> ARTICLE
Weird, they actually changed the season numbering because when we were doing the rewatch Crunchyroll distinctly had them as seasons 1-6. 

That's annoying because in the show itself they use the higher numbers too. Oh well, thanks for clearing it up.
>> ARTICLE
It's back!
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah!
>> ARTICLE
physco pass!!!!
>> ARTICLE
I noticed on the producer credits listed are TV Tokyo, dentsu and BN Pictures. So... Gintama is now under Bandai Namco Pictures? New name for Sunrise?
>> ARTICLE
Just another Sunrise studio, no big deal. 
>> ARTICLE
Wednesday Funday! The lovable idiot is back!
>> ARTICLE
That was fantastic: both the episode, the OP, and the ED.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone tell me if I have to watch all of Gintama prior to this season. Or can I just jump right in?
>> ARTICLE
You should watch it before you watch this.

Reading the thread for this same question helps too.
>> ARTICLE
Should I watch the first Gintama now that this is out? I am extremely confused as to whether or not this is a re-adaptation or a sequel. In other words, I don't want to see reoccuring skits.
>> ARTICLE
This is episode 266, you are welcome ;D
>> ARTICLE
Ok ill watch the first series then :) thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Aaaand Gintama is back. Life is good again.
>> ARTICLE
That Nonomura reference at the beginning had me laughing immediately. This is how you know this is going to be a good series.
>> ARTICLE
I already caught up with the manga and want to start the anime. Should I start from this season or from the beginning?    
EDIT: Ok, thanks guys! I think I will start from the 3rd episode. The huge episode number is a bit daunting though :)
>> ARTICLE
You could start watching from the beginning and the new season at the same time to get in on the weekly threads. Most of the recurring side characters show up early.
>> ARTICLE
Entirely your decison lol
>> ARTICLE
Start from episode 3, that's where the show actually starts as it shows Gin and Shinpachi meeting. Episode 1 and 2 are anime original and just throw a bunch of characters together that aren't actually introduced until later. I think you should watch it all to enjoy all the great voice acting.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely the beginning. Don't rush it brah
>> ARTICLE
Let's see with what arc it starts  
Edit: Nice the time-clock arc(?)(Can't remember the name), the OP and ED are good. So far Gintama has never had a bad OP/ED.  
I think I'll stop reading the manga so I can watch it "blind"
>> ARTICLE
Same, I've been reading the manga but now that the anime is back I feel like I should stop.... but the current arc is too good to stop now :T
>> ARTICLE
This is what I did. A small part of me wished that I didn't read the manga so I can fully enjoy the anime by not knowing what to expect. Still great though. Hopefully,  [](/s "they go back to the correct arc order as is in the manga. I really want to see the confessional booth animated")
>> ARTICLE
I'll just read till the end of the current arc. And I think they'll get to the original order after this arc.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama and FMA:Brotherhood are the only 2 shows for me that have never had a bad Op/En
>> ARTICLE
Not only does Gintama have really good OPs and EDs, it consistently gets better. I think my fave songs from the show changed like 3 times in the last 20 or so episodes.

Except the first op though, that'll always be my number 1. 
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Why would you want to watch a fourth season of something you have never seen?

Joy to to the world gintama is back bitches !

Good to see Gintoki hasn't lost his habit of [slapping alarm clocks like they his bitches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt-j1FdBmMM)
>> ARTICLE
I'm crying...I'm not even sad, or happy...I'm just...crying...Ok, I'm really happy, words alone cannot express the happiness I feel.

The moment new Gintama anime was announced for 2015, the 2015 AOTY became completely void, at least for myself.
>> ARTICLE
Frigging hell, honestly Gintama returning is just the thing my life was missing :). awesome episode as usual, then again Gintama never fails to disappoint xD
>> ARTICLE
In your face, Sunrise!
>> ARTICLE
I'm really liking the new opening and the new ending.

Also the animation is very clean and nice looking.
>> ARTICLE
We got rank 1 boyz!
>> ARTICLE
This might be a dumb question. I'm like 100 chapters into the manga. Could I start watching this before catching up? From what I can tell it's fairly episodic and there won't be much I'd miss. (I still plan to catch up, though)

EDIT: Thanks guys. I watched it, and the only character I had to look up was Ketsuno. I even recognized most of the people in the OP.
>> ARTICLE
Should be fine. You might miss a few references (earlier part in this episode referred to the last Gintama movie, Yorozuya Forever, which intended to be the 'book-end' of the Gintama anime) but nothing too much.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I think you can, but there some important characters, which got introduced later, but you can always catch up.
>> ARTICLE
King of comedy is back (damn op is rly nice)

>> ARTICLE
Just finished my whole series rewatch. This will be good.
>> ARTICLE
From the moment he picked out that giant booger to the end, I couldn't stop laughing. And I'm loving that ED. 
>> ARTICLE
Why is Gintoki always [breaking clocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpoPRTmFbb8) after a drunken night of sleeping?
>> ARTICLE
Man it sucks that i have to wait until i can see it on other sites.
>> ARTICLE
It's already out! Search Gintama on reddit and see the latest threads.
>> ARTICLE
Ok so I never watched Gintama, should I start at the beginning or can I watch this and understand stuff?
>> ARTICLE
Start at the beginning.

This is episode 266.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, thanks, I didn't know if this was a completely new series or a sequel.
>> ARTICLE
It's season 7 essentially.

Start from episode 3 though, the first 2 are like a pilot episode thing that is kinda weird.
>> ARTICLE
Where does this season start manga-wise? I planned on reading through the manga to catch up.
>> ARTICLE
I havn't seen the other seasons of Gintama...yet, can I just jump with this one?
>> ARTICLE
No, because once the plot advancing episodes air, you'll have no idea what's going on. Also, you won't know the hidden and intricate relationships between every character.

Right now, all you see is their comedic daily life moments.
>> ARTICLE
Am I suppose to watch Gintama past episodes? I got recommended by a friend because she said she loved the series.
>> ARTICLE
Yes and no. Yes because they're fucking awesome, and no because most likely the plot will make sense even without it (but do look up the characters in a wiki or something to at least know where they're coming from). There's a lot of running gags though, that make more sense after you've seen the past episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or did the animation quality improve significantly since the last season? I feel like there was a lot more detail and color!
>> ARTICLE
ok so can I start the show here since I dont feel like watching a million episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Where's a good starting point for this show? I want to watch it, but I can't watch over 350 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Start at episode 3 and watch the first 20-30 episodes as they're character introductions. Then just watch the major arcs.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
This goes past a simple reference.
>> ARTICLE
references within references
>> ARTICLE
Gintama has like a DBZ reference every episode ;D
>> ARTICLE
First time I saw a Psycho-pass reference though, or was that a fault on the subber's part ?
>> ARTICLE
I am sure he did randomly say Psycho Pass. I think Gin just shouted random stuff when he got hit.
>> ARTICLE
Is it still worth to pick up this Anime? Haven't watched it before tho...
>> ARTICLE
Watch the OVA that was recently out to get a feel for what the show is like, then decide. Starting from this one is ok too but you'd be missing out on a lot if you don't start from the very beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Yes for sure, keep in mind that this episode 266 and you will miss lots of background information if you pick up the new season now, but following the story shouldn't be a problem.
>> ARTICLE
Do I need to watch the other Gintamas to understand what's happening. All those episodes is really daunting..
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
Then it's a no for me. I'm looking for fresh new anime's
>> ARTICLE
Your loss then.
>> ARTICLE
I like how you didn't have to explain that Gintama is *different* and push him to just give it a chance like some hardcore fans do. Short answer to a straight-to-the-point question. Upvote.
>> ARTICLE
Hey! can I watch this without watching the other gintamas series?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but you will miss lots of background information. It's recommended to start from the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Alright thanks! I don't think I have the time to marathon the other series so I will just watch this either way.
>> ARTICLE
Disgusting.
>> ARTICLE
Please have mercy on me.
>> ARTICLE
You're fucking up man. You're starting from episode 266. That's two hundred and sixty five episodes you haven't watched. Some might say it doesn't matter as much, but you really aught to watch from the beginning. And by that I mean from Episode 3 on (skip 1 and 2)
>> ARTICLE
I'll consider it, in the distant future, perhaps.
>> ARTICLE
You can always catch up later, this series had amazing moments, one of the best drama/emotional/action/comedy scenes anime has to offer.

The first 38 episodes kinda sucked though...
>> ARTICLE
I see, well yeah I could always catch up. If I like this new ginama serie I will probably watch the others, thanks for the information!
>> ARTICLE
No problem, see you in the weekly discussion threads then ;D
>> ARTICLE
By "lots of background information", he means a *whole fucking lot*. Gintama picks up from where the manga left off so it's gonna be difficult for you to understand already built plot points in the later episodes. You should probably start from the first season and decide from there if you want to keep watching or not. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey episode 25 was a classic!

Also, though the first 38 episodes weren't up to the quality of the rest of the series, they're still kind of important for world building and character introductions and background.
>> ARTICLE
Yes that's true, but re watching those made me realize the difference between the comedy back then and the newer episodes.

And yeah episode 25 was definitely a highlight. 
>> ARTICLE
Could someone elaborate to me the difference between all the gintama animes? is there a correct order to watch? are the ovas filler? thanks in advance
>> ARTICLE
It goes:

1. Gintama Season 1
2. Gintama Season 2
3. Gintama Season 3
4. Gintama Season 4
5. Gintama'
6. Gintama': Enchousen
7. This current one

I think the OVAs are filler, (can't really remember after reading so much) but it's hard to tell filler from manga material in Gintama. Even filler is really enjoyable for me. 

Btw, based on http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows, Gintama has one of the lowest number of filler episodes for a long running series at only 9%.
>> ARTICLE
thanks

so, its actually similar to hajime no ippo or initial d, where they stop the anime to wait for material, got it
>> ARTICLE
> it's hard to tell filler from manga material in Gintama

Quoting for emphasis 
>> ARTICLE
So I just want someone to tell me if it's fine to just start Gintama with this, since I *really* don't feel like going back and watching a few hundred episodes first. (Nor do I really have the time with the size of my backlog)
>> ARTICLE
I feel like there are a lot of in jokes you wouldn't get if you just started now. 
>> ARTICLE
Just wondering, could I just start watching with this episode? I've heard a lot of good things about Gintama, and I've tried to start it from the beginning, but I've also heard that the first 20 or so episodes weren't very good, which I realized was a lot of episodes. So would I lose too much from just starting from here to see if I like it?
>> ARTICLE
For just a taste, I think it will be fine. You might lose some humor from not knowing the characters but this episode is not tied to a ongoing plotline either. I don't see it working out in the long run when Gintama goes into more serious plot-based arcs, but just to see if you like it? I think it might be alright. 

But then again it might be better to give you a more parody-based episode for a taste. If you know Death Note, try episode 25. If you know DBZ, try episode 119. 

Yea, give it this episode a try but don't make it your final judgement either. Gintama is a series that builds on itself and is better when you know the characters. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok, thanks dude! I'll probably just try those couple episodes you suggested the go back to the beginning if I like them. Thanks again!
>> ARTICLE
You wouldn't get the gags since you're not familiar with the backgrounds of each character. I suggest starting from episode 3, watching the first 20-30 episodes and then just watching the major arcs. 
>> ARTICLE
You're starting from episode 266. 

two hundred and sixty six. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen Gintama before, but I kinda wanna watch this...is it okay to start here? Or should I reeaalllyy watch the earlier seasons first? I'd probably watch them after I've seen this if I like it enough
>> ARTICLE
No, start from episode 3. How many times has this been asked in this thread?
>> ARTICLE
Since it's a new series technically, is it worth beginning from this Gintama? 
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend watching from the beginning. But nothing is stopping you from watching this new arc if you want ;)

Just give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
if you are asking if you should watch the other parts of gintama first, probably. There's no real overarching stories really except 1 but characters aren't going to re-introduce themselves.

But do whatcha want. 
>> ARTICLE
No, you should start from the beginning of the whole series. This isn't actually a new series but season 7. Take your time and enjoy it cause it's an absolutely fantastic series and one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, you're going to need to watch from the beginning (Episode 3) to understand the characters and their backgrounds. 
>> ARTICLE
When they broke the breaks I had to pause the video, take a walk, and curse my imagination.

I'll fight every last one of you who say otherwise.

I didn't think it was going to be so typical harem ecchi fest, but episode 3 is a pretty good indicator of where things are heading.

What I've heard from a friend, apparently the writer doesn't start working until it's midnight. Too lazy at work to confirm whether this is true or not / look for the source, but makes sense when you look at Gintama though.


Edit : Tried looking it up a little, couldn't find anything myself. The friend has some important exams she's studying for currently so I don't feel like bothering her either. So, I'm prepared to get slapped any time now along with getting shout at that I came up with this thing.

There's no way he could manage that delivering weekly chapters with amazing art..

On a serious note , I'll try to sneak somw time from my friend to see if she remembers where she caught that info

It's literally impossible.

Plus no assistant is going to work with him if he starts working at midnight. No aspiring manga artist is going to work a graveyard shift.

I think you vastly underestimate just how exploitable aspiring talent is.

Especially to work on something as well liked and established as Gintama. I imagine the number of talented artists willing to work any schedule nonstop for little or no pay just to get a foot in the door on a show like that has to be in the thousands.

it is part of jump fiesta special i believe.

Ah, I need to get on that. I love the show but I have only seen the first season and nothing else.

There are several releases, at this point I wouldnt worry too much about it. if you already met all the major characters, you dont need anything else to see them.

WTF dude, hilarious

this, my friends, is the typical gintama we all love

Oh god it's been awhile since I've seen that. The part with Shinpachi's glasses just made me spit my drink.

There's never too many. Once you get to a certain point, you'll wish there was more.

Is that after 50 episodes though? 100? 200? It just seems like you have to watch too many to get into it, unless you're really hardcore.

20-25 episodes for me

Same. It was at 20-25 that got me going but it was around 50 when i realized I don't it to ever end.
>> ARTICLE
Watch an episode a day and you'll catch up in less than a year.
>> ARTICLE
None of that has anything to do with it. Gintama is an episodic comedy, therefore it relies on character interactions. Due to this constraint of the genre, you need to be introduced to the many, many characters you have right out of the gate. This gives you approximately 20 episodes of *just* character introductions. Once you get to that point, you can literally watch whatever episode you want whenever you want to watch it since it's episodic and not serial.

The only issue with this is that there actually *is* an overarching story, so you need to be aware of the plot arcs (usually 3-4 episodes) and not watching anything past them until you've seen them since they generally add new characters and tones you'll have to be aware of for later comedy. *Just like every other comedy in existence*.

The best equivalent I can come up with from Western media would be The Simpsons as it also has moments that are "no going back" points, like Maude dying, or Krusty meeting his father.

If you're already looking for excuses to not watch a show, then you won't get far in the first place. For me, I set a limit of roughly a fourth of 12-25 episode series, and about 25 or so for long works to see if I like what it's doing. You don't just judge something on cursory overview; we wouldn't be saying Parks and Recreation is one of the greatest comedies made judging only by the first season. Think of Gintama like that, because it's basically the only anime that follows Western episodic comedy formulae
>> ARTICLE
Krusty meets his father? Holy shit.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty intense
>> ARTICLE
That was one of the old episodes, from the Golden Age of The Simpsons.
>> ARTICLE
Man, during 1991? I grew up watching The Simpsons and I can't imagine how I missed that one even accounting for all the Simpsons reruns.

I'll have to check it out.
>> ARTICLE
dear viewers still wondering whether you should watch it or not, as we said multiple times:

the first 25-40 episodes are introduction episodes, introducing the huge cast of gintama. the comedy arcs and serious arcs are all based on their interaction with each other and towards the new characters. (of course you could watch them just like this, but it is funnier if you know that that is the shogun and the kondo (gorilla) who are acting as the board)

is it worth it? from what you can see in the vid, hell yes.

the only skippable episodes are the first 2, those are anime special and has nothing to do with the original source material.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm toughing through the early episodes right now, but doing so at 1.25x speed helps keep me entertained.
>> ARTICLE
They said "Shogun" about a dozen times.  I totally knew it was the Shogun, and this is the second clip I've ever seen from Gintama.

Like "The Last Action Hero", it's only inaccessible to people who've never experienced the genre.
>> ARTICLE
The first time I watched this clip they edited out all but the part where they're snowboarding and using the penis brake, so it wasn't clear that it was a shogun.
>> ARTICLE


>

Wow. I'm sorry but this actually puts me off. 
>> ARTICLE
Considering that Gintama is a few hundred episodes long then a good introduction to the main cast isn't that bad.
>> ARTICLE
Hey be happy it isn't like one piece, using the first 300 episodes to introduce the cast haha
>> ARTICLE
Shows like that I just tend to put in the background until it actually gets good.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, you mileage may vary. Just watch it and see. I kind of hated the first episode, then every episode after that I was addicted.
>> ARTICLE
Followed by a few hundred amazing episodes
>> ARTICLE
The episodes aren't bad. It's just confusing because you don't know or care about the characters yet
>> ARTICLE
That's only like 12 hours of watching before it gets good that seems totally reasonable. 

Wait I mean seems like a nightmare. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I've mastered the Gintama joke.


The Pope and Charles Manson walk into a bar. The bartender sees them and says, "**WHY ARE THE POPE AND CHARLES MANSON WALKING INTO A BAR TOGETHEEEERRRRRR**" while pointing ^(and also a vein pops out on his forehead)^^and ^^also ^^he ^^has ^^like ^^3 ^^frames ^^of ^^animation

Bam, hilarity.
>> ARTICLE
Yep,  thats the my other problem with it. I don't think i get the humor. 
>> ARTICLE
I never managed to get used to the "screaming at the weird stuff that's happening" portion of the formula and I've seen ~80 episodes. I think some aspects of the humor in Gintama is more of a hit or miss then people make it out to be and if it's a miss for you, watching dozens of episodes probably won't change that. 
>> ARTICLE
They do overuse the straight man joke with Shinpachi in the early part of Gintama, which I also didn't find that funny, but they manage to strike a better balance later on for it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm caught up with the series, and I'd still have to agree with you.  As much as I love it and want to tell everyone and their dog that they should be watching it, there's simply never going to be a point in the show that you'll magically switch to liking it if you don't appreciate the style of humor they're going for; The humor is almost always done in the same style, with a straight man overreacting to and explaining why the funny man's actions are absurd.  The jokes certainly becomes more "risqu" and get taken to entirely new levels of absurdity as you make your way further into the series, but it's always fundamentally done in the same format.

It's odd: I can rationalize that the show's humor is literally some character screaming about why the joke is funny, and that ordinarily that would just ruin the joke... but I still find myself laughing like a maniac every time.
>> ARTICLE
Not to evangelise for the show or anything, though I do like it, but I think the big thing that the humour does that works for me is that it kinda keeps it simple, in a sense. Not that it isn't convoluted, exaggerated and ridiculous, because it definitely is. But what it does do that's kinda unique is that the episodes tend to start out early with a joke, and then rather than just leaving that to sit as it is and move on to some other material, it keeps that joke, and uses it as the central theme for the rest of the episode, or even series of episodes sometimes. It builds on it, ramping up the stakes, and making it go on longer than you think it could possibly be funny. It manages to base an entire comic narrative on one single joke. It's almost like a good stand-up routine in that respect, constantly building and returning to the original joke that put the whole story in motion.
>> ARTICLE
Dondake!!
>> ARTICLE
You mastered the straight man.  That's not what the joke itself is...
>> ARTICLE
by meaning introduction, it kinda episodic due to introduction of characters. did you notice how many character were there in that clip, each of them has reasons to be there, which will grow in you. I myself stucked at watching gintama before even episode 10. but yeah i admit i dropped for a year when i only watched up to episode 4 then picked it up again when i watch some of the clips in youtube, the drop was my greatest mistake in my anime journey. 
>> ARTICLE
The first 25 episodes are funny though - I'm not quite past them myself, yet.  It's not like they're just character introductions...  They've got stories and comedy.  

It's a lot like Seinfeld or the Simpsons.  Once you know the characters the show is easier and more enjoyable to watch.  But the show is still perfectly watchable and funny even if you don't know them. 
>> ARTICLE
As someone who thinks of Gintama as their favorite anime, that's understandable. It's a tall order, so if it's too daunting I get that. If you put in the time you probably won't be disappointed either. Hell, I would even say quite a few of those 25-40 episodes are pretty great on their own.
>> ARTICLE
I'm always confused as to why people talk about the earlier Gintama episodes as if they're a necessary evil. I actually quite enjoyed all of them as well. 
>> ARTICLE
It's funny that I think that 40 episodes is a lot, when One Piece is my favourite anime. This is even taking into account the fact that I feel that OP's introduction, i.e. before they enter the Grand Line, pretty short, even though it's about 50 episodes long.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. Episode 25, the famous nabe pot episode, is still one of the best standalone eps in the series
>> ARTICLE
That episode was the last one for me. The fact that they decided to go with a dinner table episode as their last episode (at that point they were saying Gintama will be canceled so why bother with extra work) and totally nail it got me. I am standing as a hardcore fan here. Gintama is the only anime I literraly suffocated and cried for laughing too hard. 
>> ARTICLE
OMG that stuff is pure crack it just kept getting better 

"we broke the breaks" lmao
>> ARTICLE
Is that anime always like that ? I need to watch it ASAP
>> ARTICLE
I just reached the point where this running gag started, unless I missed something from much earlier.

In an honest effort to make the Shogun's stay more pleasant, they ended up accosting him as transvestites, stripping him naked piece by piece, sending him past a police blockade to buy some new underwear, then tossing him into a river.

It's amazing how it all goes downhill so quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Watch it ASAP. It takes a few episodes to get into it but my God, it instantly became my favorite anime. 200 episodes in and I still laugh out loud at least once per episode, if it isn't a serious arc. And like others have said, their action is phenomenal.
>> ARTICLE
During the comedy arcs, yes.
>> ARTICLE
And at the same time, the serious arcs are some of the best action scenes of any anime.  I've never felt so invested in the outcome of the characters for any other anime.  That's the brilliance of a character-driven show.  It's the characters themselves that you enjoy so much, not just the individual jokes.
>> ARTICLE
And even the serious arcs get plenty of jokes!
>> ARTICLE
I don't know of any other show that can actually make me cry, and then have me laughing like an idiot before I get the chance to stop crying. Not that Gintama does that a lot, but it has done it to me at least 3 times.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah! Been there, done that. It's such a roller coaster, but I love how they can make you cry and laugh in almost the same instance~ It's great!
>> ARTICLE
Eventually yes, it goes of the rails.
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes I see epic, serious fights in Gintama, then I see hilarious scenes. Can someone explain how this anime is able to do both and still is so much liked?
>> ARTICLE
In terms of quality the show is top-notch. Be it art-style, animation, character design, sound design, osts, script they are all amazingly well done. This allows show to go extreme in the way they want to with no problem. They go retard, then it is FULL RETARD; they go epic, they go FULL EPIC. It never feels out of place or forced
>> ARTICLE
To me, it's the very consistent characters. The show goes from scenes where the characters are snowboarding on the naked Shogun, or trying to rescue Gin's soul from the asshole of a dead cat, to a brutal bloody coup of military insurgents, but throughout all of it the characters involved are clearly the same people. In lots of action shows it seems like the main characters are fundamentally different people depending on if they are in a serious moment or not, their whole personality and style of dealing with things changes. Gintama doesn't do that though, Gin is clearly the same person regardless of whether he is trying to save his dick from being replaced with a screwdriver or if he is standing back to back with one of his closest friends bloody and exhausted surrounded by enemies and accepting their fates to die a beautiful death fighting to their last breath.

Throughout the whole show every character receives lots of development that makes their actions make more sense, but still remain consistent to how they always act, which also adds to the strength of the interactions between these different personalities that really drives the whole show.
>> ARTICLE
Basically....it's raw. It shows the characters in their entirety. Their good moments, their stupid moments, and those moments where you'd quickly look arround and make sure no one was watching. They're so mean and vicious towards each other because they love each other but they also aknowlage their flaws. 

What you end up with is a bunch of goofs that know what's important and needs to be protected. Not important for other people, but important for them. 

Add that with the 4th wall being a 4th window and you basically get Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly? Because of the Author. His writing makes it easy to understand when the situation is lighthearted and when the stakes are high. 
It also helps that the Characters aren't just simple comic reliefs, but actual characters. They just all have their own brand of crazy. 
That's probably what makes it so special. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure what I just witnessed. 

1000/10, OP comedy is OP.
>> ARTICLE
so, what I take away from this is: Gintama is Japanese Futurama

EDIT: Humor probably leans more Archer than Futurama.
>> ARTICLE
Stop comparing it to shows that aren't actually bad. The comedy is the same trash shit as Family Guy. 
>> ARTICLE
Kek. The comedy is objectively the most superior in all of the anime medium. 

Meh, guess that won't matter to a tastless (is it tasteless when your tastebuds are drenched in salt?) bigot.
>> ARTICLE
nah, this is just very Asian humour. It comes across better with Japanese. 
>> ARTICLE
I never found  Family Guy funny, while I like Gintama=> I disagree.
>> ARTICLE
You seem to have a strong opinion of a show that you have seen 1.9% of... 
Let's see, NGNL a 9 huh. The show that has a camel toe panty shot of an 11yo in the first 2 mins.. yeah, I don't think you get to say what's good and what's bad. 
>> ARTICLE
Ad Hominem isn't exactly a good way to prove a point. All you're doing is insulting the person while saying absolutely nothing about what they actually wrote. 'Tis silly. I'm not saying I agree with the guy, but you're not really any better by saying that about NGNL, lol..

Besides, I personally quite like Family Guy. It's complete trash but who cares, it's not even trying to be good. It's trying to be dumb shit. And it works.
>> ARTICLE
I wrote it to be partly ironic and partly to put the guy in his place, even more so after reading his other comment. Firsly, ironic because I made a comment about a show that he likes based on the first ~2% (2% of a 12ep series is only about 5mins). NGNL is an easy target because of the way the show introduced Shiro (even though the rest of the show is quite bad as well for other reasons, poor writing, poor characterization, over the top fanservice, etc.). Secondly, to put him in his place because people who have seen so little of a show shouldn't voice their opinion on it, at all. To see 6/316 episodes and say "all the humour is like this.." blah blah blah is fucking retarded. You're entitled to your opinion having seen so little, that's fine. Just know that having only seen 2% of the show, to other people, your opinion is only worth 2%. It's essentially worthless. 
>> ARTICLE
You state that as a fact but it's just your opinion man. And clearly plenty of people like it with how many episodes it's gotten so you can't claim it is bad. Its just not your taste.
>> ARTICLE
The comedy is frivolous. Matt and Trey were right when they said the Family Guy writing staff was 3 manitees in a tank with some idea balls. Gintama is slightly better since it does actually parody stuff and at times there is thought behind it, but most of it is still frivolous bullshit. 

You want a comedy anime that's actually good? Try Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. The show parodies Japanese culture, most segments have a meaning behind them, characters don't really develop per se, but if a character's shtick becomes old, they toss it. The only problem the show has is sometimes it doesn't know when to move on from a joke and will hammer it in for too long. Other than that, it's probably the best purely-comedy anime out there.

---------------------------

Then, to address the two Western cartoons the guy mentioned...

Futurama is actually a kind of deep show that has actual meaningful comedy and actually does tell something of a story.

Archer is starting to get bad though. Season 3 was the last good season. The show is slowly circling the toilet now because it's not really going anywhere and the characters aren't really developing at all, and the jokes are getting reused and stale. The only thing keeping it alive was the fact that they changed the scenary the past two seasons by doing Vice and then Magnum P.I. I honestly hope this is the last season.
>> ARTICLE
Everything you've laid out is basically a strawman for you to beat down without giving actual evidence for your points other than for other shows that make it seem you know what you're talking about. Using Zetsubou Sensei right off the bat is just haughty, sorry. 

The same is true of using Futurama's points: Gintama has the *exact same positive traits*, and to use those as a counter-argument against Gintama sounds a lot like someone trying to prove they know what they're talking about, but getting ahead of themselves to attempt to be different. 

It's the same fallacy that falls under the whole "manatee" concept. Matt and Trey wrote that to show, at the time, that Family Guy *really was* the same thing every week. Comparing that to Gintama, which is a Japanese show based on Japanese cultural contextual clues, manzai, historical record and contemporary Japanese pop culture is completely ridiculous. 

I don't care if you don't like Gintama or not. Comedy is subjective. But your argument sounds like it's coming from a sophomore in college. "You want a comedy that's actually good?" Try not trying so hard to sound like /r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
Well,  same goes for family guy so his point still stands. 
>> ARTICLE
 No, man. It doesn't. Being critical without any backing analysis is subjectivity and in no way does it stand on its own.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, he isn't being critical though. He is saying he sees similarities to family guy. I can agree with that because the similar kind of random stuff seems to happen there with no strings attached to any plot. 

The addition that family guy is "trash shit" is obviously subjective and a hyperbole. Sadly nuance is often lost on young Americans.
>> ARTICLE
He is being critical in saying "stop comparing it to shows that aren't actually bad". That statement implies that it is bad and can't be compared to good things, which is critical, without any backing statements for why it is bad.
>> ARTICLE
But the thing is, a lot of the seemingly random stuff that happens can have a major effect on the plot in a later episode. There's TONS of foreshadowing in this show.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, fair enough. :D Just saying I understood why he compared the two.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it is really comparable to any of those shows. It is very unique and heavily tied to referential humor within the anime culture. I would say it does have a lot of slapstick/physical gags, and lots of absurdist humor. I'd sooner compare it to things like Airplane, Spaceballs and Monty Python, but even then only some of its humor is similar to those.

Sooooo, i should probably watch this show...

I was searching for a new anime to watch, it seem'si got my answer.. Yes 
>> ARTICLE
Not only is Gintama genius in comedy, it can also make you tear up quite a bit with a lot of nice episodes, and there are a bunch of them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I've ever laughed this much in the course of 5 minutes. Gintama just moved from a "whenever I get around to it" to a "must watch now".
>> ARTICLE
I've avoided watching this show, mainly because it has 300 episodes, but you've convinced me to start.
>> ARTICLE
Ah every episode with the shogun is pure gold
>> ARTICLE
Hell, almost anything with Shogun Shige-Shige would have worked.  Like the episode where they give him a haircut....  Jesus, that face he makes when his skin is too tight just kills me.   Watch Gintama. Or read it.  It's worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so glad I don't have any context for this. 
>> ARTICLE
Even with context it still makes no sense tbh
>> ARTICLE
That's what makes Gintama so fantastic. The fact that they take a simple premise, have one small thing go wrong, and everything so quickly spirals out of control and immediately goes to 100%.

Note that that description works for both the serious and comedic arcs.

100% agree with you, preach it breddah.

A friend of mine showed this to me about half a year ago. I couldn't help but burst out laughing.

'what's this from man?! I have to watch it!'

"Gintama, it's pretty cool, you should watch it."

'lemme search it up: hmm gintama, pretty high rated on MAL, maybe I'll-- wait what the fuck, ~~360~~ (less lol, I forgot) eps?'

And I still haven't watched it, as I just don't have the time to watch 316 eps as a student. :(
>> ARTICLE
I'll tell you what I've told other people who've said the same: Yes, you do have the time. I was going through an extremely rough time a little while ago, working one and a half jobs and dealing with personal stresses and I finished Gintama *and* One Piece. Thrice. An anime episode is only ~18 minutes once you cut out the openings and endings. In short: you're overvaluing your time itself.
>> ARTICLE
It is one of those shows where you can simply watch it just because you want some fun time. Between two study sessions for example or 1 episode before going to sleep or a quick 1 episode while on a bus if you don't care about how stupid you will look when bursting in to laughter awkwardly. There are quite a few arcs numbered around 30+ but most of those are only 2-3 eps. tied together. Longest one is ~7 episodes I think.  So don't let the number 360 get to you.
>> ARTICLE
There are currently 316 episodes and the anime is on break.

Only 316? I tot I rmbed a gintama ep 400 coming out a while back... Looks like it was just plain old retarded me.

Tbh it doesn't really matter dude since most of the episodes are episodic with short serious arcs that start around ep 55 but still you can watch that just whenever and it's no rush!

I have to confess I can't stand Gintama. I hate so much they explain every joke as it happens. I know if I could see past that little thing I would enjoy it, but I just can't. Sorry.
>> ARTICLE
Seems you just don't understand http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BokeAndTsukkomiRoutine humor, which is a pretty Japanese thing (although it does exist in western comedy) so it's understandable. The Tsukommi or "straight man" explains/reacts to the situation which is what you're describing.
>> ARTICLE
Probably it's exactly that. It just have the feeling that the writers think I'm dumb so they explain all the jokes to me. For me it's like a laugh track saying "You have to laugh here". I know it's my fault, I know Gintama is outstanding, which makes me sad because I'd like to enjoy it too, but I can't. 

Also I think I exposed my opinion in a polite way, so I don't understand the downvotes. I din't said Gintama was a bad anime, I only said that I can't stand a particular thing on it, and said it was something personal.

But above all, thanks for the information, /u/Kenzorz, today I learned.

I disagree.

It doesn't have spoilers, but knowing Sougo/Hijikata/Gin/Shogun's past definitely contributes to at least half the jokes in the arc, so it would be much better if you were familiar with the show already.

I would watch Gintama I just haven't found good quality episodes of it atleast the earlier ones are all very low quality :(

I really enjoy every gintama clip people share here but I will I am never going to watch 300 episodes.

i just wish it actaully started out this good. first few episodes are hard to get through.
>> ARTICLE
This was super helpful for a lot of people it seems. It gives you an idea of the kind of comedy that one might expect after the slow start that people talk about with Gintama. I never made it past those first few episodes myself.

Unfortunately, it confirmed my initial feelings that Gintama's humor just isn't for me. It was all just too zany. Plus I hate that straight-man routine where one character deadpans a description of what another character is doing and maybe calls that person an idiot.

some QUALITY out there, but it's all good. It's not like Gintama gets a big budget lol

I think id rather watch clips of that anime than the show itself. Seems too humorous for me. I don't think I could watch a whole episode of that

Regardless of what people say, the show isn't pure comedy and there's actually a story to it. This incident led to a "lost on the snowy mountain" arc.

Thanks for embodying why I haven't watched Gintama yet. I'm sure that was funny and all, but I got bored around a minute in because I don't care about any of these characters. 
>> ARTICLE
That's like going to a stand up show and saying you got bored by the comedian because you don't care about him. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not really fair to write off a show based on some out of context clips because those clips don't happen to explain every character and why you should like and care about them.
>> ARTICLE
You don't need to know the characters to get why it's funny. Just watch a bit further.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the whole thing and didn't really like it. Not for me I guess
>> ARTICLE
Hmm i disagree. I think is absolutely essential to understand the characters for the comedy to work. Sure, Gintama's comedy is parody based sometimes, but mostly it's jokes relating to how different characters handle unique and silly situations. 
>> ARTICLE
I was just talking about this specific scene. Is it going to be funnier if you know the characters? Yes, definitely. Is the situation funny whether you know the characters or not? Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I do think it's definitely funnier when you actually know the characters. The series has great characters and instilling them in these comedic moments is made great from that familiarity. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yea for sure. It definitely does help if you know the characters. But regardless whether you know them or not, many people will still find that situation funny.
>> ARTICLE
This is from episode 237 and you've never watched Gintama, so of course you don't care about the characters, you don't know any of them. It seems kind of odd to say the reason why you won't watch a show is because you don't care about the characters when all you've seen of them is bits and pieces from hundreds of episodes in.

Watching it right after I finish typing this.

Edit: Just finished watching episode 1. 
This is Gintama on crack!! Osomatsu would win the "most parodies in one episode" award if there was one. The gags were pretty funny, but I feel like I missed out a large portion of the comedy because they kept referencing their original show's concepts, which I've never watched before. Still, it's a promising show :)

I'm pretty much sold on the voice actors alone. They somehow managed to get the trio of Fukuyama, Ono, and Kamiya. The only other shows I can think of that have all three are Working! and Durarara.

You should check out the anime anyway you might like it, i personally didnt like the first episode especially the first half. Its a comedy so it might still work for you
>> ARTICLE
> jesus gintama fans downvote everyone that dislikes it.

yeah they're making me question whether I should even bother to give it another chance.
>> ARTICLE
That comes with going against any popular series; I'm almost guaranteed downvotes whenever I mention my dislike for Lelouch.

It's saying something though, when 5 of the top 10 anime series on MAL are Gintama.

;)
>> ARTICLE
They're making lots of Transformers movies and Michael Bay is constantly employed, Nickelback sells out stadiums, Young girls find Justin Bieber attractive.  I could go on, but the point is it doesn't say anything.

If Gintama fans decided to have a reasonable discussion, maybe I'd have given it another chance, I was almost ready to do so, but now I could give a shit.  I don't need to give another chance to an anime with such a toxic close minded fanbase.  I was probably right the first time.
>> ARTICLE
It's your loss, but what would you expect when you express an opinion that wholly conflicts with a large number of users in this community?

Your comment wasn't particularly inciting discussion either.

> I loved binbougami but I hated gintama. What do I do

To use your example in your reply. Would you expect a reasonable discussion when the opening line of your conversation with: Transformers, Michael Bay, Nickelback or Justin Bieber; lovers, entirely consists of:

***The thing you like*** sucks. Discuss.

How do you think they will react?


----------------------

As an aside, your usage of the idiom "but now I could give a shit", says that you outright care about this issue... as you would have said "I couldn't give a shit" if you had no more shits to give. That's good news! The world of Gintama awaits you!

[Fun video for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=224&v=8Gv0H-vPoDc) If you don't want to watch the whole song, skip to 30secs for 5sec and 1min 5secs for 20secs.
>> ARTICLE
well reason seems to have prevailed so I'll indeed give it another shot.  
>> ARTICLE
Lol or you could just watch the anime without caring about it's fanbase? I mean are your opinions that swayed? Who cares what we think if you like it or not is up to you, no one else. You dislike it? K that's fine we all have different opinions, no need to bash on others for it
>> ARTICLE
I said I didn't like it when I tried it the first time, and now the fanbase wants to convince me to give it another shot.  I'm willing to entertain the idea that I should give it a few more episodes if people convince me rationally.  But if people just downvote me for hating it based on the first two episodes, then it doesn't particularly motivate me to do so.  I was fine with never watching Gintama again.  I wanted to like it because it has like 9000 episodes and seems popular, so I was hoping there was some substance to that.   Well people seem to have become more reasonable in their actions so I may give it another chance.
>> ARTICLE
I don't get it. Are you watching a show because of its fanbase?

 Have you ever considered you get downvoted because you are trying to be edgy using words like "hate" "boring as fuck" "give a shit" "should even bother" 

Dude "such a toxic closeminded fanbase" are trying to win you over by suggesting episodes and stating the fact that it is highly regarded as one of the best anime, while you acting like you are above them. I think you should give them a little credit while reconsidering your attitude. 


>> ARTICLE
in the discussion threads i was voiced my opinion on the new show and since i wanted an actual sixtuplets comedy instead of 15 minutes of referencing other shows i got downvoted to hell lol.

The stupid thing is in that thread theres only positive criticism because everyone that said something bad about the show got downvoted to hell and then people deleted them lol.

The first half of osomatsu is really stupid and not funny at all the second part is a little better. Hopefully the next episode its actual comedy instead of just references about everything trying to pass as proper comedy
>> ARTICLE
to be fair complaining about too many references to other anime is retarded given that the tag to the show is parody, although the criticism about having yaoi or something else might be valid(i didnt watch the show yet to know if you are right)
>> ARTICLE
the show didnt have a "parody" tag tho at least not before i watched it, and how come having too many references is not a good cause for complain but having yaoi is? The problem is instead of evolving on the premise they had they decided to just be as unoriginal as possible and copy everything from other anime instead of building the comedy upon itself.

And the first half was straight up stupid because it wasnt funny it was just like a normal otome adaptation but they werent making any jokes. It was just awfull at the start, lets see how episode 2 works.

At the time i watched it it didnt have the parody tag at all, and i was expecting the comedy between the 6 dudes not some random parody of everything with no substance
>> ARTICLE
i was talking only about the tags, usually a anime that has yaoi it will have the tag, so not having the tag may be a reason to complain because you went in without knowing that, but you can say the same with the parody tag i just didnt know it didnt have that at the start

i dont know any anime that has too many references, so that i find it annoying, i know about a manga that had a shit ton of references from jappanese actors that i didnt know, but it didnt bother me and i still managed to enjoy the manga. In parody anime there can be a lot of references to Japanese things(movies, traditions, anime,manga) and because im not from japan most of them i will not get, so having many references helps because you have the chance to get some of them, so i dont see a harm in having too many

but how i said before, i didnt see the anime yet so i dont know if it was funny or not, im talking only for the idea of the anime. I think you didnt like it as much as others because you entered with a completely different opinion about it, and maybe there is some nostalgia about it as well because ive seen that it had a prequel a while ago, but i hope it will get better for you if you continue to watch it
>> ARTICLE
Ill prob watch 3 episodes, but theres no nostalgia because i didnt watch thr previous one

It was like 10 minutes of fujoshi bait then some 5 min of other parodies and 5 min of black and white talking. When it was just the dudes it was fun but the parodies already appeared in so many other anime. For me it was a waste, and they didnt introduce the characters and setting well for a first ep. 



>> ARTICLE
Yes but osamatsu didnt have a parody tag...

At least when i watched it. Now it appears mal has the tag but i went into it with only the expectations of it being a comedy done in homage of the previous work, theres no way i could predict the first half would be fujoshi bait and yaoi trash. 

From what i read about it before watching it there was no indication of it being a parody instead of the sixtuplets shenenigans i was expecting. Going from a strong premise to just another parody show is a really bad downgrade. That is why i was pissed, there are already so many parodies why waste a super strong comedy premise to be another parody...


They could have done so many fun things in a first episode but they decided to copy shit and make fun of it. What a tremendous waste
>> ARTICLE
Not sure about the series but at least this episode parodies a lot of shoujo tropes so I'd say watch it.

Damn. Came here thinking exactly the same.

Damn, every time we get one of these threads we get more people realizing they need to watch Gintama.

For real guys, don't let the length intimidate you. This is a show that you can really watch at whatever pace suits you. You can watch it on the side of other anime. 1-2 episodes per week even is enough. But honestly, if you have been really enjoying clips like this from Gintama, the show is definitely one you'll enjoy. And who knows? It might just end up becoming your favorite anime. Because that's what happened to myself and a lot of others who gave the show a chance. 
>> ARTICLE
Ya once you start watching gintama ,you will probably binge watch all episode.its f***ing hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
Can confirm

I watched it as a "side" show back in October so that I could catch up to the upcoming 2015 Gintama season in April. 3 episodes per day

It ended up being my favorite anime show and consider it as a "main" show now

For those lazy to click on it, Skip the first two episodes since they are anime original and rather lame. Episodes 3-13 introduce the characters and are fun, but the show finds its grove after this and just keeps better and better.

Honestly, I'd say just read the manga and start watching it from episode 70 onwards, or whenever the current director took charge. Best of both worlds.

You should at least watch the Hot Pot episode (Episode 25), the manga chapter is great but the animation is sublime, its like Madhouse themselves helped with it.

You definitely shouldn't watch that movie before episode 58, it's a remake of 58-62 iirc. (it won't spoil anything major, but the build-up to it does improve it a lot)

You know, I went and bought a bag of msg to use as seasoning and get my umami fix, turns out it tastes terrible if you use more than a tiny amount.

Better throw that bottle out. Studies have identified msg as a carcinogenic chemical and it has been prohibited from use in foods in a lot of places.

That was debunked a while ago. There are no proven downsides to ingesting MSG in small amounts, just as there aren't any for eating small amounts of salt. Overeating of anything will ruin your body.

There are exactly as many real, peer-reviewed studies showing dihydrogen monoxide is harmful as there are real, peer-reviewed studies showing MSG is harmful.

Dihydrogen monoxide is water, you idiot.

MSG is completely safe. Here's the FDA on MSG:

>Is MSG safe to eat?

>FDA considers the addition of MSG to foods to be generally
>recognized as safe (GRAS). Although many people identify
>themselves as sensitive to MSG, in studies with such individuals
>given MSG or a placebo, scientists have not been able to
>consistently trigger reactions.

>Whats the difference between MSG and glutamate in food?

>The glutamate in MSG is chemically indistinguishable from glutamate present in food proteins. Our bodies ultimately metabolize both sources of glutamate in the same way. An average adult consumes approximately 13 grams of glutamate each day from the protein in food, while intake of added MSG is estimates at around 0.55 grams per day.

http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm328728.htm

MSG is a salt crystal form of l-glutamate, an amino acid found in many foods, like beef or tomatoes. In addition, the human body produces it in abundance. MSG being bad for you is a myth, and makes no sense when looking at the science.
>> ARTICLE
I know that, you idiot. And I'm still saying if you have any studies proving consumption of water can result in cancer, I'd willingly give it up. My point was to prove how ridiculous your analogy is. And I'm not trusting anything the fda has to say. They've previously allowed a lot of other carcinogenic compounds into our food as well. Read up on some papers (there's one from Oxford too I think) or try a site like msgtruth.org
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you at least. There's a lot of things allowed in the US that are banned in just about every other country, even third world countries. Pretty sure msg is one of those if I'm not mistaken. People act like government organizations are always 100% true, but they are just as likely to be misleading as any private sector organization. You asked for him to support his claim and the only thing he could provide was an FDA verdict? Yea, ok, I guess it's fine that the FDA permits arsenic in chicken feed too, right? Because the FDA is always right and the entire fucking European union and all its collective authorities had no idea what they were talking about when they banned it. 

Sorry idiots downvoted you so hard. They'll probably, and unfortunately, be enjoying cancer and heart problems down the road and then see the FDA turn around and ban all that shit.

This is why people use tomatos.

All of the umami and none of the excessive sodium.

Yeah you'll have to add less than the amount people would usually use for salt, and even then usually salt brings out taste better imo.  But try putting MSG on the egg of a sausage egg McMuffin.  It's glorious.

you can pick up the arcs that catch your interest

gintama is made out of arcs that are completely unrelated and different from each other. Some arcs are meh while some are godlike so its the best to watch the arcs you want and skip those you dont want.Characters will always keep their stereotypical behavior and roles but you will never get tired of them.
>> ARTICLE
> gintama is made out of arcs that are completely unrelated and different from each other.

No, that's not true. The serious arcs are related to each other, maybe you just can't see it (yet)

Honestly people should just drop it if they can't stand the comedy. It's  an essential part of the series and what makes us love the cast so much and the serious moments so much more impactful.
>> ARTICLE
The first 2 you can skip. 
>> ARTICLE
I always say to get up to the Benizakura arc and then decide if it's for you.
>> ARTICLE
Most of these gags are from the beginning or the end of the episodes, or specials. Not the actual show itself. I'm not taking anything away from Gintama, but just a forewarning. It's still hilarious especially the diarrhoea episode.
>> ARTICLE
Don't watch the first 2 episodes. They are pilot episodes celebrating the adaptation. The show starts from episode 3.
>> ARTICLE
I realize it's overstated, but you really do have to get through the first 13 episodes. Everything before that is setup for the characters. Once it takes off though, it's some of the best comedy I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
I went through 25 episodes and wasn't impressed, then someone told me it takes off at episode 48. -_-
>> ARTICLE
yeah the earlier episodes aren't as good, but just get through it and you won't regret it
>> ARTICLE
you must have watched too much anime by this time, i remember watching gintama for the first time and instantly hooked binge 200+ episode within a week. that happens last year when i havent watch as much anime as now. the more anime you watch, the easier you drop it without any serious thought.
>> ARTICLE
\> gets to episode 48


"meh, still not my thing..." 

"MATE, MATE, no mate, trust, episode 65, it get's A.Mazing"

\> gets to episode 65

"yeah it's a little better, but still..."

"BRO BRO BRO, NO BRO, EPISODE 93. YOU HAVE TO GET THERE"

etc


I think, eventually, you either give in and watch Gintama, or you die. 
>> ARTICLE
Its because the show has a sort of snowball effect. As you watch more, the more characters develop and more running gags develop. After a while, that snowball is big enough to be the best thing you've ever watched, but the point where its big enough for the show to be fun for you to watch is different for everyone. I was hooked from the beginning, but for some of my other friends, it took longer.
>> ARTICLE
True if you do not find it interesting after 48 episodes it is not for you.

>> ARTICLE
I can understand why people would say that, it really does get better and better.
>> ARTICLE
So does masochism, but you've still got to get kicked in the balls first. 
>> ARTICLE
:D, it might just not be your type of comedy and that is completly fine
>> ARTICLE
or maybe its just not for some people, when i started watching i didnt really noticed it was boring, just wasnt expecting to be the best thing ever
>> ARTICLE
It's different for everyone. For me, I was hooked right from the beginning because the concept is just too insane. But I believe you will be impressed eventually.
>> ARTICLE
Welp fuck it time to start Gintama I guess.

What the actual fuck. I love how the guy is just sitting there with his dong hanging freely and the girl doesn't give a shit. Sorry, I don't know their names. This Anime looks too funny though, I wish it didn't have so many episodes or I'd marathon it. 
>> ARTICLE
*As someone completely out of context here*

...What just happened?
>> ARTICLE
So key things here.

* In Food Wars they show the exquisite taste of food by having imaginary scenes of different landscapes when the one eating the food takes the first bite, this more often than not also results in their clothes getting ripped off their body in their imagination.

* Gintama loves to play on the fact that they gain very little money which is why for part of the clip they were shown in storyboard form.

With the reference to food wars here they added both of them together for the result you could see in the video, a little side reference that was funny was how they reference Isshiki and Eizan in the beginning as "The naked guy in an apron" and "The delinquent that sounds like Gin-chan".
>> ARTICLE
And the immodest orgasms? I assume that's from Food Wars as well? Or is that just for kicks?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it is indeed from Food Wars.
>> ARTICLE
[naked Gin in an apron](https://53rg10.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/filler_nakedapronfanservice.jpg?w=536&h=1065) for relevancy.

> Food wars reference in Gintama

Thanks for sharing, that was very funny! :)

Gintama is definitely on my bucket list of anime to complete.
>> ARTICLE
It's the holy grail of anime to me, and to many others. Please, don't let the length intimidate you. Watch it at your own pace. 1-2 episodes a day or a week, if that suits you. 
>> ARTICLE
Sougo! I hope you are doing well this afternoon.

> Please, don't let the length intimidate you.

Never have, never will, for any anime!

It is more a scheduling thing. And a "I have yet to get to my other 15+ suggestions" thing. I will certainly get to it...eventually!

You should, it's amazing. The newest arc is awesome as well (it's a serious arc).
>> ARTICLE
> The newest arc is awesome as well (it's a serious arc).

I would definitely be interested in seeing how Gintama, known for its comedy, handles drama. I imagine it is not *as* good as the comedic material, though.
>> ARTICLE
That's a baseless assumption.
>> ARTICLE
Oh trust me they are better than most Shounen arcs.
>> ARTICLE
hahaha. well last 2 episode is kind of mindfuck for all of the non manga reader including me. the beginning of the current serious arc is the best so far.
>> ARTICLE
> ...the non manga reader...

Huh. For whatever reason, I never knew that Gintama was based on a manga. I always thought it was an original of some kind. Just goes to show how out of the loop I am when it comes to this series. :3
>> ARTICLE
Oh, it's still superb. The four devas arc, for example, is one of my favourite serious arcs in all of anime. Of course, the comedy is still superior as it is the ultimate, however, the serious parts are splendid as well.
>> ARTICLE
God damn it I gotta start watching this show.
>> ARTICLE
This is from an OVA, hope you guys all know that 
>> ARTICLE
Specifically from Jump Festa 2015 special.
>> ARTICLE
Haha nice.
>> ARTICLE
Was what Kagura said at the beginning also a Shokugeki reference? That the guy wearing nothing but an apron, meaning Isshiki, gives a cake to a delinquent who sounds like Gin-chan, meaning that Elite Ten guy voiced by Sugita. Does that actually happen in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Alright. I'm gonna watch Gintama now.
>> ARTICLE
10/10 holy fk that was hilarious

ROFL wtf, time to watch gintama xD

A reference? In Gintama? No way!

Food that makes clothes explode = food wars Kappa

how the hell can people dislike gintama from watching things like this, blows my mind

Because it's really one-track in the beginning, I have a hard time getting back to watching it after 50 episodes.

Fuck, I have to start watching Gintama now.
>> ARTICLE
Do my ears deceive me, or is that Taiga I'm hearing?

yep. she's also known as the tsundere queen as a large majority of her roles are tsundere's.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's the same voice, Rie Kugimiya.
>> ARTICLE
You mean Taiga from Toradora ?

Yeah her voice actor is very famous (Rie Kugimiya) in the japanese voice acting world.
>> ARTICLE
There are so many of these clips from Gintama that make me want to watch it, but ive tried so many times but i just can't get it started. (Ive watched up to 50 episodes....)
>> ARTICLE
Eh comedy is kinda repetitive.It abuses straight man shtick way to much.
>> ARTICLE
Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, the /r/anime comedy holy grail does the exact same thing. The manzai routine is the bread and butter of Japanese comedy; every Japanese comedy you will ever see uses this structure for basically every joke.

So to say that it's used too much is somewhat like saying they use dialogue too much.

Which then becomes funny when they make fun of the straight man shtick

Can someone spoilerlessly explain the premise of Gintama?
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely meta, fourth wall breaking random shit, with some action mixed in. At least that's what I get from everything I've read on it, haven't watched it myself yet.

>> ARTICLE
its like this, every 25/40 episodes its a serious arc, between that its comedy and while its most of the episodes, sometimes also has some sad ones.

Basically you never know what to expect from an episode, always a surprise
>> ARTICLE
it's imo the best long term anime scenario there is. completely open. there's no reason for a story. the back story itself is totally batshit crazy. 5 episode story arcs, then random comedy in between works great. 4th wall breaking, really random humor, and just the right amount of seriousness in between really keeps it attractive.
>> ARTICLE
Aliens invade Edo-era Japan.
>> ARTICLE
Alternate history setting where instead of the US showing up on Japan's doorsteps in the late 1800s, aliens descend from outer space, take control of the government after showing off their technologically advanced weapons, and a civil war ensues with the samurai.  

Set some time after the war, it follows Sakata Gintoki, a former samurai who now runs an odd jobs business.  It follows all kinds of random adventures with Gin, the other Odd Jobs members, and several other characters, including but not limited to, members of the special police, various aliens, Gin's comrades from the war, and the Shogun himself.  It's mostly episodic and comedic, but it does have several more serious arcs.
>> ARTICLE
im on episode 43 or so. when does the shogun show up? pretty sure i ahvent seen him yet

I think the first episode he's involved in is Ep. 83

I enjoy Food Wars, but the fan service is unnecessary. It's a good show without it. 
>> ARTICLE
the fan service "foodgasm" draws fan in, or draws fan away after 1 episode ( that's why it becomes popular enough to get an anime) .

It gets toned down on the road ( since it doesn't need to draw fan anymore).
>> ARTICLE
It starts to tone down a lot on it later. They still have the food-gasms but they are more creative.

Fuck you, fuck Ginta, fuck everything. I legit cried and froze. This feels so weird, like I got metaphorically whiplashed.

Welcome to the beautiful ride that is Gintama
>> ARTICLE
I remember when I watched that scene. It literally took me a minute to start laughing because I didn't know how to feel. Gintama has that ability.
>> ARTICLE
I love how willing they are to make fun of themselves. That one right after the Yagyuu arc, holy shit man. The show is just an emotional rollercoaster.
>> ARTICLE
Kintama does that to you a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Careful, it's 'G'intama.  "Kintama" means testicles.

Actually, the show's name was purposefully selected to sound like testicles.  That's what I hear anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I believe he is referring to an arc that parodies this called 'Kintama' with an alternative version of the MC called Kintoki.

Also the rip Kintamas kintama out live...it looked painful.

Ah okay.  I haven't actually seen very much of the show, so I'm not aware of such an arc.

>> ARTICLE
I'm legit crying in laughter lmfao, time to catch up on Gintama
>> ARTICLE
What makes it hilarious to me is the amount of *effort* that was put into the story. Like, it tugged on your heart strings, it made you go hug your dog, they even had that one fucking sad OST playing. And then it does a Gintama on you.

I love this show.
>> ARTICLE
I gotta watch this show, but the sheer number of episodes is intimidating.

Still though this may have sold me on it.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry about the episodes. You can stop anytime. It's that kind of show. Just start watching (and remember that the first few are a little rough, but it gets better ... way better ... soon).
>> ARTICLE
Could you remember where it starts getting better? I have problems with dropping anime if a couple episodes in a row are pretty bad.
>> ARTICLE
Damn ... I just skimmed through the first couple eps and got a nostalgia attack lol. IIRC the ep where they introduce Sadaharu was the first one that I truly enjoyed, that's ep 10.

The reminder was really just tempering expectations for some people who might expect it to be really good from the first episode. Before the series has a chance to introduce most of its regular cast. You could very well like it from the very beginning haha.
>> ARTICLE
Random for most people but general consensus is 20-ish. But worst part is you can't skip it because those are the necessary character intros and with out those you will be lost as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
I think episodes 1-24 are great, but if I had to pick an episode to encapsulate why the show is amazing, 25 is the first one where I almost died laughing. It's a full on parody of death note that somehow crosses over with Naruto.

The first season is basically a lot of world building and character exposition, so there isn't much time for the show to do what it does best and weave those characters into comedic situations and more serious plot lines. They still manage to do so, it's just not as prevalent yet.
>> ARTICLE
The first 20 episodes are pretty boring and are for learning about the characters, start at episode 3 btw. Honestly the longer into the show you go the more you enjoy it, it took multiple months for me to get through the first 100 or so episodes but I went from 180-300 in about 2 weeks. Thankfully the longest arcs are only like 5 episodes, so you don't need to force yourself to keep watching if you don't want to that day.
>> ARTICLE
I said this in another comment, but it gets funny once you warm up to the characters and setting. 99% of the jokes are character humor and in-jokes, so once the show stops caring too much about introducing characters, it gets funny as hell.

That being said, personally the first twenty episodes are just lower quality than the rest. That's not to say they're bad, just not as funny as something kike OP linked.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't know why I haven't watched this show yet. I have seen so many things that have made me really want to. I just keep letting time get in the way.

With the amount of time I waste on reddit I could've been completely caught up by now.
>> ARTICLE
I've tried watching it over and over..but I can't get past the first 20 episodes...I keep hearing it gets way better..but I just can't. Can someone give me a good reason??
>> ARTICLE
They have Elizabeth in tenderizes which is introduced in episode 3 and if you want to know what the duck it even is then you should watch the show.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 25 was when I got mad hooked on Gintama. You will never regret watching this series, especially when they get to the arcs. The Yoshiwara arc made me cry, and anime very rarely does that to me.
>> ARTICLE
It's just not funny unless you get immersed in it, so it takes a while to get into. There's no immediate urge to keep watching at the start. Arrested Development syndrome, maybe.

If you showed Gintoki and Kagura doing the usual "Shinpachi is just glasses" joke to someone who has never seen the show, they wouldn't give a shit. But if you've been watching from the start, then it's fucking hilarious. There's plenty of standard jokes too, but for the most part it's in-jokes and character humor.
>> ARTICLE
Character development syndrome. You need it especially for very complex long running shoes.

I find Zura to be the funniest in Gintama. I mean all of them are funny but I like Zura's ridiculous ideas that makes you think how he thought of that and why he'd do that

Kinda like Michael Scott
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention the plans he comes up with for his Joui members. I'll never understand how they're still alive with him as their captain.

Kondou is the same in the aspect of believing everything he is told, like when Sarutobi told them that they must write, "Gin-san and Sac-chan are in love" 10000 times over the internet or they would die, and they met up to do so. 
>> ARTICLE
It's recurring joke in the show that Kondou and Katsura have very similar mindsets and if they weren't enemies, they'd be very good friends.
>> ARTICLE
They're really only enemies of circumstance. Hijikata and Sogo are more gung-ho about eliminating the Joui faction. For Kondo it's just a job.

I like Kondo and Sarutobi a lot when the plotline isn't just focused on their hopeless one-sided romances, which is sadly not often.

Gintama is a show where they will spend an entire episode setting up a joke without you realizing it. You'll be looking for a character for five episodes and it turned out she was in the toilet kind of thing.

>> ARTICLE
fuck
>> ARTICLE
look up a dog called hachiko
>> ARTICLE
I know of Hachiko, but I don't get the Tom and Jerry reference. What am I missing here?
>> ARTICLE
The letter came from someone using the alias "Tom," the dog was named Jerry. 

Really random reference. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, its really subtle. They only put [Note: From Tom and Jerry.] at the top of the screen...
>> ARTICLE
Is it just the fact that they both are called Jerry or am I missing something?
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so, it's not the fact that the letter writer was named Tom, though that is undoubtedly part of it.

The actual reference is Japanese word-play, like a large percentage of Gintama jokes, and therefore kind of odd to get across in English, but I'll try: The actual name of the story (which is translated as "I'm sorry, Jerry") is "Gomen Jerry". When spoken, this comes out phonetically as "Gom en Jerry", which in turn sounds an awful lot like how "Tom & Jerry" sounds in Japanese (and also English if you slur it a bit, like "Tom 'n Jerry").

That's the joke.
>> ARTICLE
That makes a lot more sense. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Like /u/BadLuckBen said

>The letter came from someone using the alias "Tom," the dog was named Jerry.

It's just a reference to the pairing of "Tom and Jerry". That's pretty much it. It was coy little reference or homage.

>> ARTICLE
Which one?

Kintaro? Or the one with Sadaharu and the little puppy?
>> ARTICLE
Yep Kintarou. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright fuck it. I'm watching this show now. 
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts exactly.
>> ARTICLE
Start at episode 3.
>> ARTICLE
Good idea. I also agree that the first two episodes can/should be skipped--they're filler for some reason and aren't very good. The 3rd episode is how the manga starts.
>> ARTICLE
And now my pregnant wife is bawling her eyes out. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I'm only 2 mins through but I'm already scared.

4 mins in and I fucking hate this. Goddamnit, it's Futurama all over again.

5 mins in and I hate reddit so much for putting me through this. 

Finished it, still crying. Fuck you.

If only this tricked worked on people, i could watch anime forever.

So many emotions in 4 minutes haha. Need to watch this show. Fuck that little girl.

:|....:[...<:o....:'(....:|

Damn, the "I can't sleep aru" episode.

I really cried when this part ended but a few milliseconds later I was scared stiff.
>> ARTICLE
Was waiting for the punch line, didn't think it was coming and got really depressed. Then BAM out of no where Gintama strikes again.
>> ARTICLE
It would've actually been touching had it ended before the crying.

But I was waiting for the other shoe to drop.

I haven't even watched Gintama, but from what I know of it through the sub I knew that it'd end something like that.

Gintama is really great when it comes to long punchlines. [Here is a WT with a short description, watch order and other things](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3j3e6k/wt_gintama_the_random_incarnated/). Episode 25 is a nice standalone episode to try! 
>> ARTICLE
Haha, this remind me of that Futurama episode with the dog. But at least this one made me laugh at the end!

I need to watch Gintama, eventually.
>> ARTICLE
Well, time to rewatch Gintama!
>> ARTICLE
i don't know what emotion i should be feeling after that
>> ARTICLE
I got Futurama PTSD from this :(

I'm sad that the show is going more serious now that its wrapping up.

easily some of the best humor in the medium.

When I saw the dog all thinned out, I was like "NOPE, NO, NO. NOT HAPPENING"

I have a weak spot for bad things happening to animals..

You gotta finish. It's not what you'd expect.

Ohhh... Oh no... I was not expecting that at all. I don't know how to feel right now

Best Scene Ever. First time watching it made me laugh for 10 minutes straight.
>> ARTICLE
Omg this is the one scene i remember the most that was not from the main arcs that actually made me cry/tear up the first time i watched it, so the ending made me feel really emotionally conflicted. I keep thinking of this scene as basically the embodiment of what gintama was but havent seen the scene since and forgot which episode it was in. Glad other people feel the same way.

ouch! my tear ducts.

Okay, where would be a good starting point to watch Gintama?

Episode 3, as ep 1 and 2 are anime originals and pretty bad. Good standalones are ep 25 or153 (153 because of this scene). [WT with a short description, watch order and other things.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3j3e6k/wt_gintama_the_random_incarnated/).

Well then! It's unfortunate that I never made it to episode 3 when I considered watching Gintama before. Looks like I'll give it another shot after the severe emotional injury I've sustained from watching OP's clip.

Ep 20 is a pretty good standalone as well imo

holy shit that suprised me.

I love how they'll do this. Just throw stories in that are completely unrelated to the main story in the arc/episode that'll either make you laugh your ass off.
>> ARTICLE
Omfg this is my favorite thing from Gintama to show people! I love seeing the concern turn into sadness turn into terror. Gintama is one of a kind with these kind of jokes.

Wow I hope Jerry ate her.

It worked. Even with the end. God damnit.

Why must they do this to me. I am soft for the cuddly animals.

omg the punchline
crying, then laughing

God damn it! I was actually crying towards the end and was seconds away from letting it all out until that bullshit happened.

I don't know if I should be happy or sad right now.
>> ARTICLE
This is honestly one of my favorite moments in Gintama like I'm not even kidding this made me die of laughter when I first saw it
>> ARTICLE
I loved this part of the episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never watched Gintama before but if it has that level of humor regularly then count me in. When he screamed and kicked the radio... oh my goodness. I just hope I didn't wake up my roommate.
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend it! [Here is a WT with a short description, watch order and other things](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3j3e6k/wt_gintama_the_random_incarnated/). Episode 25 is a fun standalone episode to watch! Most start to love Gintama after that ep.

that last part didnt make up for what i went through to get to it..

I was going to comment 'Jerry come back!!'

But na, fuck that.

I need to watch gintama.

First time I watched this was in bed in the dark of the night. I nearly shit my pants!      

There are more ghost stories in that episode right?
>> ARTICLE
That was an emotional fucking rollercoaster.
>> ARTICLE
I think I need to start watching this, there's just a huge amount of episodes to watch
>> ARTICLE
try it, the first episodes are slow and you might not like it (the real first episode is the 3), but it's awesome if you like the humor and the characters are great. 

Don't force yourself, you can even watch it super slowly as the story isn't that important most of the time.
>> ARTICLE
FUKIN KNEW IT!!!!
>> ARTICLE
This is like that one episode of Futurama with Fry's Dog. 

Jesus Christ, when i first watched that, it made me completely miserable for a while.
>> ARTICLE
What the actual f*ck
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad there was that ending because it was funny and made me feel better.
>> ARTICLE
I have to admit, I haven't seen Gintama yet, and the fanbase keeps nagging about how it's the greatest thing ever, which annoys me even more. The fact that it is fucking long doesn't help either.

So I approach stuff like this with scepticism. "So a comedy show tries to tearjerker now? Fan-fucking-tastic. The story itself is pretty cheap in that regard as well."

And then the ending. For fuck sake, hats off to you Gintama. I might just make an attempt to start watching you. *Might*.

^^^Right ^^^after ^^^I ^^^finish ^^^SAO... 
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck?
>> ARTICLE
There's no trying when it comes to tearjerkers and Gintama. When it wants you to be sad, tears will stream.

I wish people would stop referring to it as "a comedy show" because it's so much more than that. There are *multiple* story arcs some being funny, some being completely serious. And why do  people complain about the length? If you don't like it, no one is going to force you to watch all 300+ episodes. If you do like it, then the large number of episodes is a good thing.
>> ARTICLE
First time viewer. The first four episodes were a bit of hit-or-miss to me, but when it hit, it hit really well. I'm really excited for when it picks up and it turns into all hits.
>> ARTICLE
All I can say is, stick with it. It's one of the most enjoyable and rewarding shows I've ever watched.
>> ARTICLE
Of all the anime series I enjoy Gintama has the worst pilot of any of them
>> ARTICLE
it really doesn't prepare you for how amazing of a show Gintama is.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I finished Gintama and this seems like the perfect excuse for a rewatch.

Loved seeing the[ t-t-time machine gag](http://i.imgur.com/LggV3.jpg) again.

First time viewers might get confused by the first episode, which was a hour long special when it aired and not chronologically first in the story. Katsura and Elizabeth don't really appear until a bit later. Though I guess it doesn't really matter.
>> ARTICLE
The time machine gag is fucking hilarious!! It always gets me!
>> ARTICLE
I only recently started Gintama and am already up to episode 75. Never has an anime before sucked me in so fast! This is definitely becoming one of my favourites
>> ARTICLE
Soon you'll get out of the 4:3 hell and reach the 16:9 (widescreen) heaven. One of the best achievements ever.
>> ARTICLE
what episode does that start? 

my spoiled ass couldn't get out of the 4:3 before giving up.
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember atm. I'll check it when I can
>> ARTICLE
It's episode 202 (Gintama'). So, unfortunately, 4:3 isn't going anywhere for a while.

Just force 16:9 with your videoplayer

Nah, that just stretches the issue, and I've got a 4:3 secondary monitor anyway.

Woah, just checked it and you are right. I thought it was earlier than that.

Gintama consistently breaks the fourth wall.
>> ARTICLE
I was surprised that I enjoyed it as much as my first time around 3 years ago. (I hardly rewatch shows)  

Now I can understand nearly all the jokes, language tricks etc. and I am also not held back by subtitles. After all Gintama is one of the most cultural knowledge requiring show around. Its nearly impossible to understand everything unless you are japanese. There are references to nearly everything from morning shows, weather casters, doraemon to tv commercials and a lot more...  

I am definitely looking forward to next week and the weeks after that.  

Favorite moments from this week:

(Btw if anyone can read the text from the bonus art let me know. I think it says "This is just an archive" or something like that)
>> ARTICLE
The text in the picture appears to be "" ...Strangely enough, the first characters don't mean anything in Japanese and appear to be Chinese based on the Pixiv tag (not sure why he'd pair it with Japanese katakana, though)

But, judging by the meaning/context of the show it probably says "Reality/4th Wall Destruction".

I love Gintama and I'm awestruck seeing a lot of first-time viewers in this sub. When I first started watching the series, I didn't think too much of the first two episodes. It really picks up later on.

So stick with it boys and girls. Let's all enjoy the ride together.
>> ARTICLE
I loved it!

First time watcher here, and I'm really glad we started this weekly watching. I've had this show on my Plan to Watch list for a very long time, but never got the chance to watch it because of just how long it is. Watching it with you guys was a great excuse to finally pick it up, so thanks!

Regarding the first four episodes, I liked them very much. They were super fun, and I found myself laughing a lot (which doesn't happen often in comedy animes). I did not find the first 2 episodes to be confusing, because we were told about the general background of the show (about how aliens invaded Edo) and we were introduced to all of the important characters. The third and forth episodes made everything a lot clearer, and it was fun to see how Gin met both Shinpachi and Kagura.

Really looking forward to next week. This show's super fun so far!
>> ARTICLE
When I first tried to start watching this show a few years ago, I watched episode 1 and 2, and said, "Ugh, what IS this?" and stopped watching.  A few months later, I tried again, and still couldn't get into it.  It wasn't until a year later, that I decided to start watching from episode 3, and only then did I enjoy watching Gintama.  (And even then, it wasn't until about episode 25 that I really committed to loving the show.)

And now it's my favorite anime.  As others have said, it's a slow start.

On a rewatch, episode 1 and 2 are still terrible, although it makes more sense after knowing all the characters.  Episode 3 and 4 are so much better.  I'd forgotten about the time machine gag, and so I laughed for 5 minutes straight and sake came out my nose.

Erhm, yeah.  It will be fun to rewatch all the episodes again, especially since I know much more about Japan this time around.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, great start.  Went into this knowing practically nothing about Gintama.  When they went around the corner in the first episode and were met by hovercrafts, I about lost my shit.  Can't wait to see where this goes.
>> ARTICLE
Another first time viewer here coming in fairly blind. I'll be a dissenting voice and say that I'm not a fan from what I've seen so far. The overblown reactions and slapstick aren't amusing to me and the anachronism stew of a setting is just distracting, not interesting.

I'm sure some people might tell me to give it more time, but if the tone of the series stays the same I don't think it's right for me.
>> ARTICLE
It gets great arnd ep 12
>> ARTICLE
Eh rather 22-25
>> ARTICLE
After finishing the show I just laughed really hard at the introduction scene narrated by Shinpachi. 

Anyways i actually enjoyed these episodes way more than the first time watching, probably because i'm already familiar with the characters.
Also I never truly noticed how kagura's voice changed through the show.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely enjoyed these first four episodes as a first time watcher. I love the humor, and picking out all the references, like the star wars ones in episode 2. 

Also liked the intermission in ep. 4 with Hideaki Sorachi saying the most philosophical thing I've heard in an anime, "Come to think of it, just living is pain, too. I want to become a cheesecake," I really hope there's more of those in future episodes. 

I really wish I watched this series sooner. 
>> ARTICLE
That cheesecake bit had me in stitches.
>> ARTICLE
ahh shit i forgot to watch it yesterday. just ran  the 4 episodes in the last 2 hours. anyways time to talk about the show.

Well its just like they say, funny as all hell and packed to the brim of references. We got our 3 MCs here, samurai that loves shounen jump, glasses straight guy, and... IS THAT TAIGA!?

I love this show already, its so stupid that it manages to get me yelling my computer screen.

Favorite moment of the 4 episodes was the "NO" "FRIGGEN" "WAY" triple team.


>> ARTICLE
That is indeed Rie Kugimiya as your main heroine for this series, enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
Going to love rewatching these episodes with one of my favorite Gintoki quotes in episode 3, "The country? The Sky? You can have em. I'm busy protecting the things in front of me. I dont know how many things I failed to protect. I don't have anything left but at least if I find something falling before me I want to pick it up."
>> ARTICLE
First time viewer, and I can't complain much.

Episode 3, scene in the Pub: What is written on Gintoki's sword?


[Well, she got a point](https://i.imgur.com/DMAZD5N.png)

It says "Lake Touya" and it also has a few stories too. Wouldn't want to spoil it.

Thanks, I was just wondering, because it is one of the few words that wasn't translated.
>> ARTICLE
My first time watching it and I'm not really sure how I feel about it so far. Also what is the time period the show is it  based on a futuristic 1880's    Japan ?
>> ARTICLE
It's based on the Edo period but instad of Westerners coming to invade Japan, it was aliens. :)

>> ARTICLE
You don't have to worry about the world not being fleshed out, the anime spends the next 200 episodes doing that, bit by bit. No exposition dump, only show-not-tell.

>> ARTICLE
Wow I
>> ARTICLE
That gorilla mangaka and it's inner monologue about how life is a pain had me in stitches at the "I want to be a cheesecake part". Watched the first 5 episodes and it's perfect. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I'm the only person who enjoyed the first 2 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Wait what!? I didn't see a thread saying we were starting DX FUCK Now I gotta watch Akuma, Mahouka, MA, DnA, OP, AND four episodes of Gintama today fml...
>> ARTICLE
I really liked episodes 1-4. Being someone who has seen a couple random arcs (screwdriver arc, etc) I'm excited to go back and learn about the characters! 
>> ARTICLE
So... I couldn't contain myself when this was announced and now I'm on episode 88. Really wanted to watch this along with everybody else, but couldn't stop once I started.

Send help.
>> ARTICLE
:P Its all good. The purpose was to have fun after all! 
>> ARTICLE
This was announced like 3 days ago... you must be multitasking 2 episodes at once or something.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, I've probably skipped something like 20-30 episodes of actual story arcs in favor of stupid episodes with more gags. Not that those episodes aren't great, just not what I'm feelin right now.

Did watch the Yagyuu arc though, probably one of, if not on the top of, my favorites
>> ARTICLE
that's the first time honestly I have ever heard someone say they skipped over a story arc not sure if i should feel disappointed or impressed.
>> ARTICLE
Really? Don't get me wrong benizakura arc etc. were great but the real selling point for gintama are clearly the normal episodes
>> ARTICLE
Loved these four episodes. See you guys next week.
>> ARTICLE
This is so awesome! Glad to see a lot of activity for my favorite anime of all time! :)

I'll contribute.

I guess im one of the few that really liked the first two episodes. I liked it because it's already a two-parter so there's a bit of a feeling of having invested more after episode 1 and moving on to episode 2.

When I first saw these episodes, I remember having the "WTF?!?" reaction because of all the jokes and stuff. It pretty much was a good hook for me. :)
>> ARTICLE
I actually started rewatching Gintama recently. I'm at episode 16 so I will wait for you :)
>> ARTICLE
I've watched Gintama twice (until ep 200).
Tons of comedy and action waiting of you!
>> ARTICLE
Super late to post here, but I am still tagging along! Not super impressed by the first four episodes, but I didn't expect to be. I do like the characters, though. Hoping things pick up in the next two weeks, want to get a real feel for this show.
>> ARTICLE
Good to hear you'll stick along!  
Also It will get a lot better look forward to it!
>> ARTICLE
I've been through every episode, some three or four times, and I can say this is by far my favorite anime. Give it a chance. 
>> ARTICLE
> I do like the characters, though. Hoping things pick up in the next two weeks, want to get a real feel for this show.

I am o-o
>> ARTICLE
I'm super pumped to rewatch my favorite anime, great idea OP thanks for doing this!
>> ARTICLE
I admit, when I first saw Gintama years ago, I really couldn't get into it... The first few eps are kind of difficult to get into the show in my honest opinion, but this is definitely my favorite anime of all time...

So here's my question, I am trying to get some friends to watch, but they keep stopping after the first episode... What's a good benchmark to tell them to continue watching? 

My generic response is - once you get introduced to all the characters and the environment they're in, the show really kicks up.

How about you guys?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I'll have to give this a try! Thanks :)
>> ARTICLE
If you show them one of the completely fun episodes that would probably work. Find one that they wouldn't need any knowledge to have laugh. Maybe the bath episode(actually around 1.5 episodes) or one of the parody episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I just recently started Gintama and I know he hasn't been introduced yet in this weeks viewing, but I am so frustrated at Sadaharu. He acts like such an asshole and it annoys me so much :(. Does he appear frequently in later episodes? Or is he at least less of an asshole later on?
>> ARTICLE
Btw Sadaharu is the big dog. I don't know if you messed up the names or not but if you are annoyed at him I can say the annoyance will probably be gone. Also Sadaharu has his story too
>> ARTICLE
Yep that is who I was referring to. I dunno he's cute and all but the way he bullies around Gin and Shinpachi just kinda irks me.
>> ARTICLE
In later episodes he doesn't even show up in most episodes. And if he does he mostly sleeps or something like that. Though there are a few episodes focusing on him, his back story etc.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm at around episode 50 right now and he's definitely grown on me lol. 
>> ARTICLE
It.s great to see the thread with so much activity. I won.t be able to join sadly computer is dead and can.t fix it right now. I.ll still check out these theads when I can.

When I started I started with a random episode like 167 for example

I think gintama is one of those few shows where anyone can pick up the show from any episode because there is no real plot/storyline

I agree but does anyone feel like they just got trolled by Gintama. I wouldn't be watching this if it wasn't an in joke and some one might theoretically use this as a way to prove the advertising power of Gintama. Yep definitely trolled. Well played Gintama. You go make those fighting games...

Sweet. Didn't know season 7 would be preceded by an OVA.

Nice to see The Spirit of Lake Toya again.

No social tact. Puke. Lampshading the end of the anime and sponsorships. Pipe innuendo. References to other JUMP titles. Random dramatic turns. Spurned characters piling into Yorozuya's living room to get their much needed attention.

Nope, hasn't lost its touch.

Well monja looks...[interesting](http://i.imgur.com/oeOmgQ9.jpg). No wonder it was censored.

Primed and ready to go for 266. See y'all in five hours!

> Well monja looks...interesting

Looks like Okonomiyaki... which is delicious!
>> ARTICLE
Oops, did I grab the wrong picture from the Wiki article? My apologies if I did.

It does sound pretty tasty based on the description. Just poking fun of the appearance in relation to the show.
>> ARTICLE
Puke, looks like the undigested food that's been thrown up, also because Gintama. They could make a single background episode and I wouldn't even be mad. 
>> ARTICLE
I love how Gintama never shies away from getting into the gritty business details surrounding the production of anime, openly admitting here that anime is little more than a commercial for the source material and for merchandise. 

It also made me feel bad for the manga when they said how when the anime goes away, the manga feels like it loses its spirit as well. 

This OVA would have been extremely bittersweet if the anime wasn't returning so soon. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm happy we got this, I'm just so much more happy that we get more Gintama in a few hours.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, this year will be the year I get killed by my neighbors for laughing to loudly at past 12Am, Gintama is too dangerous.

And once again Gintama reminds me that eating food or drinking beverages while watching the show is a bad idea.

Laughed and cried during a Gintama episode? Yup, that's the Gintama I know. I'm so freakin happy right now. Can't wait to watch the new season later today, and I look forward to more laughing like a maniac.

This will be my first time watching Gintama as it airs every week, and I can already feel the agony of having to wait every week for a new episode.


>> ARTICLE
Everytime man, my dad would yell at me for laughing so hard.
>> ARTICLE
>Laughed and cried during a Gintama episode? Yup, that's the Gintama I know.

During the Final Chapter movie I went from laughing to yelling (hype) to crying to yelling again to laughing to crying within 15 minutes of the end. I don't know how they do it.

I watched that movie pretty much straight after this ep.

This OVA was everything I expected (awkward introduction, something about anime production, referencing popular anime).

An OVA is a neat way to ease everyone in before the main course that is season 7. 

I forget the last time when we saw the Spirit of Lake Toya, it was nice of him to remind me.

Gin, I find your lack of tact amusing. Increment the puke counter again!

Gintama: Never afraid to delve into the business side of anime. 

Why can't we have adverts like "Ring a Ding Dong" ? Pipe innuendo, never change show. [This is what we call being Sorachi'd!](http://i.imgur.com/ZIdtMnc.png) Of course everyone piles in for some screentime at the end.

Unrelated, but has the 2014 OVA been subbed yet?
>> ARTICLE
so this is episode 1? why it say ova
>> ARTICLE
It's not episode one, it's an OVA for advertising Season 7.

> it's an OVA for advertising Season 7.

OVAs and TV shows in general exist to advertise the manga first and foremost.  This OVA came bundled with volume 58 of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
They do but this ova was more leaned towards advertisement/reminder of the upcoming season than the manga.

So the newest episode should come out tommorow, right?

Airs in Japan in [less than 2 hours](http://anilist.co/anime/20996/Gintama%C2%B0)

So if CR simulcasts it like they've claimed we should get it in 3.

**Ep. 262**  Theory: *Sorachi* watched the second volume of DVDs for ideas. Gins getting better if he isnt wiping his boogers on Kagura. I smell litigation again. Hajime has one big, goofy smile. Hell fit right in. 

How Im visualizing the parody: Sorachi researched just how close he could get to infringement. A physical line divides Sorachi / Sunrise 5 and Lucasfilm / Disney / Whatever. They exchange glares from across the line. Fujita reaches his foot over the line without touching the ground and makes a mocking face. Disney makes a comment about Fujitas divorce. Fujita slowly returns his foot back over the line with a look of defeat. Sorachis picking his nose the entire time.

Ill never get enough of Gin and Kaguras deadpan. Solid recruiting tactics. Shh, Hajime. The One True Ship was cemented in the last arc. The Otae stalker duo emerges with obvious intent. [Well this snapped me to attention]( http://i.imgur.com/3S09URH.gif ). The Yodas are coming. Kagura, please. Youre the heroine. Too much puking. Welp, Gins given up on the day. I-what? Were gonna get into some strange territory here, arent we? HNNNG, kid Shinpachi and Otae. Initializing Hajime lecture mode counter. Requesting more depressed Kondo and Kyuubei. The Yodas are invading.

*****

**Ep. 263**  Litigation meter approaching critical levels. I take it that the Galaxy Sword Master provoked war within the interests of the Yodas? Kondo, youve got this.

[Dick Entry  5:24  Hajime  Gintoki](http://i.imgur.com/Y72Bjww.png)

No bullshit between Otae and Gintoki it would seem. I mean, being half-metal has to be hard on the guy, Shinpachi. Gin pls you ruined the touching moment.

> You were washing a dead body with some junk attached

*OUCH*. Someone seems to have pissed Gin off. I cant take Tojo seriously. At all. Either Im a bit dense / drunk tonight or I feel like Gins begging needs some elaboration. [Interesting camera work](https://38.media.tumblr.com/1bb5c2ca95e911494725ee95a3f7f5f4/tumblr_mjphs94hBo1s50n3qo5_r1_400.gif) for the sparring between Gin and Hajime. Establishing a lot on the dichotomy of Hajimes humanity and mechanized self and what it means to "come back". Why do I feel like its been a while since Kyuubei and Kondo have been useful? These Yodas are childs play. Lose-lose situation for saving Hajime :/

*****

**Ep. 264**  Damn, broke the blade with his hand. So much internal bleeding in this show. Kind of refreshing to see Shinpachi take Gins place in finishing the job. And wielding Lake Toya at that! Idk, based on the background given, the Galaxy Sword Master was probably a decent investment, Yodas. Hey, we got Hajime back for good. Kyuubei god dammit. We have a beam fight on our hands. Whoa that speech on the rooftop was way more powerful than I was expecting. Yodas down; looks like well get a lengthy denouement.

[](#chiho-wut)

What is that tan?!? Dramatic internal monologue conversations. Not even going to probe the life insurance issue. Chocolate-covered almonds > chocolate-covered macadamias. Shinpachi lost his tan pretty quick. Those big, goofy smiles.

Lost it at the arguing after the PV.

*****	

**Ep. 265**  Ill never be able to unsee paw pads as meatballs. Odd Jobs had very little dignity to begin with. I was going to joke about PETA not caring about Japan [but apparently they do]( http://www.petaasiapacific.com/aboutpeta-jobs-campaign-coor.asp ). Stay classy, Sadaharu. I know it was supposed to be cute but watching Sadaharu slap-fish was hilarious. Either my household did it wrong or pets are *absolutely* a functional food disposal. [The result of Hijikata pushing his mayo obsession on everything]( http://i.imgur.com/TJjhv9jl.jpg ). This is why you get so little screentime, Sacchan. Oh, Katsura really was on standby again. I almost feel bad for him. Puppy no! I feel like Shinpachi should be able pick up on Gins tough fronts. Our ethical dilemma of the day: return the puppy or go hungry and ensure its well-being first-hand? I know the montage is supposed to be plucking the heartstrings but that whale shot, I cant. Not much smells worse than dead fish in a partially enclosed container. Gintama cant leave us without one last cheesy speech about familyand then bolting on a bill. Wouldnt want anything different <3

> I smell litigation again.

I am most definitely not a lawyer, but this seems like the kind of thing that would be covered by fair use laws considering it's definitely a parody.

> Kagura, please. Youre the heroine. Too much puking.

She already apologized for it, leave the poor girl alone.

> I cant take Tojo seriously. At all.

Nope, never.

> Either my household did it wrong or pets are absolutely a functional food disposal.

Oh, they definitely are. Just need to be careful about it.

I was initially thinking it was nice that she wasn't horrible for once, but nope, I never learn.

That's quite possibly one my favorite scenes from this series.

I'm not sure where I read this so take what I say with a bagload of salt but I'd read that Sorachi doesn't actually like Star Wars, his father however did.

I'm now expecting this to be a bonus feature in the DVD's.

Its funny how as far as I know at least that species don't actually have a name.

Shinpachi hype!

*Insert a "Mah Nigga!" picture here.*

Look at that glorious, yellow, squishy,creamy mayonnaise! Don't you just want to jump into a pool of it!

Yeah that kind of ruined an otherwise heartfelt montage.

I noticed that your new No.1 OP is the newest one. I'd almost agree but for me Dilemma just wins over it. 
>> ARTICLE
>Lost it at the arguing after the PV.

I don't even know why it was so funny. I couldn't breathe.

And I see your favourite OP has changed accordingly. If I've learned anything from Gintama, it's that the quality level of music goes higher as we go through. 

I am so hyped for new season and new OP.
>> ARTICLE
Well I must say congratulations to everyone who made it this far, weve only got 2 more movies to go. I must admit I never thought that Id be able to finish this show but here I am due to the length. Bittersweet would be a word Id use to describe this but by the time we finish this (re)watchthrough it wont be that long until the new series starts so theres not much to be sad about. Im going to need to get used to the 1 episode a week format again however. 

Also Im sorry Stairway Generation but [Sakura Mitsutsuki](https://vimeo.com/82499330) now takes 2nd place on my favourite OPs. I just love everything about it, from the use of sakura petals to the lighting effects, not to flashback to Gin's sensei. I don't think there's been an OP that I've not liked for this show which is impressive considering there has been approximately 18 songs and I'm not even covering the endings. Additionally since I'm on the topic of opening songs I feel I should mention the [1st OP song](https://vimeo.com/62309807) and how it compares visually to the final OP. You can really see the changes but it stands well on its own.

**Episode 262 ** Beam sabers? Star Wars parody arc anyone? Weve already had our lightsabers (with the sounds too) back in the Renho arc so I honestly wouldnt be surprised. [Come on now...](http://i.imgur.com/YeNWINT.png) 4 minutes in and weve got our first Star Wars reference. You cant trust that grin. [Umineko](http://i.imgur.com/MAOpt8y.png) [anyone?](http://i.imgur.com/O1bsBrU.png) Increment the vomit counter. I fail to see what is so bad about having half your body replaced. In the end Obi is still Obi, his personality hasnt changed or anything. Young Otae is rather cute. I guess Obi has always had that shit-eating grin. [What are they wearing on their heads?](http://i.imgur.com/DxHDX8O.png) Now I see why having being half-cyborg might be a bad thing. Why would you spread butter on your TV?
*****
**Episode 263 ** Im not surprised at how they integrated the term star wars into dialogue. [Were being Sorachid again!](http://i.imgur.com/x7fC9IP.png) Gin shouldering everything upon himself and looking like the [bad guy while doing so.](http://i.imgur.com/eMLh70w.png) Im sure theres a suitable name for this trope on TVTropes that Im sure someone will have. Kondo and Kyubei look good in those Jedi-like robes. Shinsengumi have a space fleet? Shinpachis really getting his time in the limelight in this arc. 

*****
**Episode 264 ** This was always Shinpachis fight in the end. Gin just drove him to fight. [This shot reminded me of the Four Devas arc at the end between Gin & Jirochou.](http://i.imgur.com/jclyinC.png) [Someones cutting onions again!](http://i.imgur.com/hAd16c7.gifv) A fittingly heroic end for Obi.[Who are you people?!](http://i.imgur.com/fgkbt4t.png) Now weve been reverse Sorachid! [Kyubei gets it!](http://i.imgur.com/GXKqOT8.png) Kaguras making up for lost screentime. That grin at the end was sweet. I love how the cast are all asking asking quesions about the movie that supposedly ends the show.

*****
**Episode 265 ** This is it, the final episode ^until ^next ^month. Sadaharu episode? Sadaharu episode. Its been a while since we saw that mascot. Im convinced now that the Shinsengumi are Reddit/Imgur users. Damn it, I thought wed finally forgotten about the mayonnaise! [Nothing wrong here.](http://i.imgur.com/P2jn8No.png) Nice callback to the Courtesan of a Nation arc with Katsura. That was a dark joke however with his teacher Yoshida. But I like dark jokes so its not a problem. Dont go down the path that I think youre going down with this puppy show! At the rate this is going [this will be my face in a few minutes.](http://i.imgur.com/abHZXFi.png) These episodes get to me and I dont even own a dog! [MFW I see that the puppy gets a happy ending.](http://i.imgur.com/GsUW0JG.png) Sorachi have mercy! My heart can only take so many feels! Movies hype!

> Gin shouldering everything upon himself and looking like the bad guy while doing so. Im sure theres a suitable name for this trope on TVTropes that Im sure someone will have.

Hm... he *looks* like a [Pragmatic Hero](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticHero) to an extent but that's not actually the case; same goes for [Good Is Not Nice](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice). I didn't really spot anything on [the character page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GintamaYorozuyaGin) for Gin that fit either.

> This shot reminded me of the Four Devas arc at the end between Gin & Jirochou.

Right, *that's* where I remembered a similar scene.

I feel like I've seen that type of "Uninvolved person shoulders the burden so that those involved don't have to suffer" trope before so I figured that it would have its own name but I guess not.

**Ep. 262** - Otae's *finally* going to commit to the dojo? I forget what happened in episode 200. Kagura's right, all the kids just want to be idols these days.

[Well that's certainly different.](http://i.imgur.com/8M3aVei.png) Shinpachi, the beam saber school has an even longer tradition than yours!It started a long time ago in a galaxy far,faraway...[Wait, it's that evil-looking guy from the OP!](http://i.imgur.com/ek353xL.png) And hehas such a grin on his face.

Obi-one? No thanks, I'm with Gin on that one. Huh, history time for Shinpachi and Otae for once. Hajime got teleported to visit Yoda, got it. [Because Jedi aren't a thing.](http://i.imgur.com/7iT6z5M.png)

New school of light sabers? I'd certainly join in a heartbeat.They even have neat robes! I'm not that surprised he thinks Gin and Otae have a thing going on, it does seem that way at times. Ooh, and Hajime was her first crush too.

[And here come the stalkers!](http://i.imgur.com/05awGcX.png) Can't have an Otae arc without them. Teaming up against a common enemy, good strategy.Unfortunately for them, he can apparently fire beams from his arm. Masked evil-looking Yodalikes watching him too, that can't be good.

[Half-human indeed.](http://i.imgur.com/YwwBMxy.png) He has the Vader thing going on, though in that picture he looks more like an older (and much taller) Edward Elric. Huh, guess he really did need that gasoline. Nice to see Gengai getting more screen time this season than he has in years. Can't live without the machine? Definitely Vader.

Flashback... you must laugh when you want to cry. [These](http://i.imgur.com/LWyuh4v.png) [kids.](http://i.imgur.com/HZMP4jj.png) Oh lovely, the Yodalikes put a giant beam cannon in Hajime and they're going to use that to start a war to destroy Earth. Even more Vader for him!

---
**Ep. 263** - Hajime's whole purpose was to start wars for Beam to make a profit on, and now he's going to be a direct cause behind Earth's destruction. That has to be depressing for him. Up to Gintoki to stop him, of course. Ooh Otae eavesdropping. She understandably wants more time for him and Shinpachi to hang out.

Gin isn't willing to wait though, that's frustrating.[Shinpachi's mad.](http://i.imgur.com/kR2GQuM.png) Rough to see Gin and Shinpachi going at it. And... now Otae, Kagura, and Shinpachi are being guarded by the Shinsengumi and Yagyuu,presumably so they don't have to fight Hajime or Gin.Huh.. *Gin* was the one asking for them to be kept there? [Oh Gintoki,](http://i.imgur.com/EvD8Aqr.png) [he never gives up.](http://i.imgur.com/xrcvHdp.png) And never asks others for help when he can really use it.

[Oooh.](http://i.imgur.com/8FbCLTe.png) Kyubei and Kondo taking it to the Beamers! [Aww,](http://i.imgur.com/3Rm25sD.png) they have a better understanding of Otae now. [And more awesome shots.](http://i.imgur.com/0nedQDa.png) Sougo couldn't hold Shinpachi there forever, [time for the Shimuras to arrive.](http://i.imgur.com/4aEPkq5.png)

---
**Ep. 264** - Gintoki trying to wave Shinpachi off, to do everything himself... [That's](http://i.imgur.com/B1ng1ue.png)[not](http://i.imgur.com/ICYkHRa.png)[what](http://i.imgur.com/W9E37wf.png)[this](http://i.imgur.com/G0QqQYR.png)[show's](http://i.imgur.com/PDlJUL3.png)[about.](http://i.imgur.com/APhoYt6.png)

[Wait, what?](http://i.imgur.com/IsWyeWl.png) I think that's the first time I've ever seen Gin give his sword to someone else. ^(Side note: that was image 7777 on my phone, neat.) Damn straight, Shinpachi. A duel, just like when they were kids... and that brings Hajime's humanity back along with his blue saber color.

Really, the Beamers had a trap floor built into their ship? [Kyubei can't handle Kondo.](http://i.imgur.com/bMSYRtA.png) At least they're safely off the ship now, for [Hajime to blow the Yodalikes away.](http://i.imgur.com/P7HhnCG.png)

A month later and... [they took a vacation?](http://i.imgur.com/x0m8gG9.png) I can understand not wanting to be around the dojo for a while. The whole macadamia nut thing is just weird though, not very funny.

Gin's always looking out for family, and that goes for extended family like Hajime too. Unfortunately there's nothing he could do in this case.Not a bad arc, but far from my favorites.

---
**Ep. 265** - [And now for something completely different.](http://youtu.be/hQhLEfONR8E) Yay for no editing. I completely understand if you don't want to watch all or any of it, so I'll put a condensed version here:**WHY IS THERE A SAD DOG EPISODE TO END THE SEASON?**

Side note: I went to rewatch the first two episodes of season 1 for [this thread](http://www.reddit.com//r/anime/comments/2zh296/what_worthwhile_anime_is_hardest_to_watch_and_why/cpj49u7?context=10000).The villain in the very beginning of the series, Kariya, has a ~~light saber~~ beam sword. Also I kinda want to call out everyone that failed to keep posting from the [first week](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/27jst8/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_14/) through now. Jerks.

Woah, thanks for the live react. It was really interesting to watch! :D
Any chance of more of these for the future? (up to you, but there aren't enough of these D;)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I'm considering it for the second movie, not sure about Benizakura since I watched the episodes for the arc already. I might be able to ramble about the series in general for that though.
>> ARTICLE
> And he has such a grin on his face.

I can't trust someone with a grin like that.

> Because Jedi aren't a thing.

That title sounds like something that you'd hear in an arcade game.

>  These kids.

Those faces haunt me.

> Oh Gintoki, he never gives up.

That made me realize that Kagura didn't have much of a role in this arc beyond having some facial expressions.

> That's not what this show's about.

I loved that flashback sequence.

> And now for something completely different.

AHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Awesome! I wasn't the one who suggested it but I still enjoyed it.

> WHY IS THERE A SAD DOG EPISODE TO END THE SEASON?

http://i.imgur.com/VJXWC4H.gifv

> I went to rewatch the first two episodes of season 1 for this thread.

I must admit it did take me a little while to get past the first few episodes. For context I started watching Gintama on September 8th 2014 and it wasn't until around episode 180 that I managed to catch up to the discussion threads.

> Also I kinda want to call out everyone that failed to keep posting from the first week through now

Looking at that first weekly thread there sure was a lot of people initially watching it. I joined the party a bit late but I did sit and read through each discussion thread every time I'd finish a portion of episodes because I enjoy reading about other people's thoughts. 

I'm quite surprised but at the same time I'm not at how many people dropped off as time went on, that seems to be a common trend with re-watches I noticed. At first their quite popular but eventually a good number of people lose interest.
>> ARTICLE
So I picked up this series about 2 months ago after a couple weeks on this subreddit and was just kinda watching it at a more average pace with no real rush to finish it in time for the new season. THen I noticed this rewatch and figured I'd try to catch up to it, but I got so absorbed in the series I ended up watching it all and finishing it a couple weeks ago. This has definitely become one of my favorite series. Fortunately I haven't seen the movies yet so I can participate in those but I can't wait for the new season.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome! Too bad you passed us earlier, but at least you're around for the end and the new season.

I did the exact same thing back when they were in the 60's.

Obi Hajime? Yoda-looking amantos? Light sabers? Warrior through space?

How the fuck hasn't this show been sued yet? Sorachi must be working his ape magic.

I was really surprised that they didn't push it and make some parody of the Force. That would have made it brilliant.

And that goddamn last episode. Fuck. I mean, it ended well and Gintoki is now well cemented into the position of perfect-husbando#2, but please excuse me while I go look at pictures of puppies and cry.

November 9th will be the [moment of truth](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25313/Gintama:_Jump_Festa_2014_Special).

Good chance they announce the return of the anime... but they might not :(

Episode 98 and 99 (Owee arc). [Katsuo](http://i.imgur.com/VEPEQM1.gif), parodies of girlgames and how they [abused the Elder](http://i.imgur.com/c7m82SR.gif) had me in stitches. 

Episode 142  [Kagura](http://i.imgur.com/UcT7F5q.gif) going [crazy](http://i.imgur.com/M0rRf2E.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Dat fight doe, I had chills all the way to the ED song which fit in perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
I have a hard time choosing, because there's just so much golden shit.  So I'll make a top 5:

5) **Monkey Hunter Arc**: Gintoki and Co playing Monster Hunter in order to get his 'joystick' back was nonstop hilarity.

4) **Kabukicho Stray Cat Arc**: Gintoki & Co getting turned into animals was hilarious and too cute for words.  And Kondo turning into a literal gorilla was priceless.

3) **Tama Quest**: Tama is one of my favorite characters, and the cast going Dragon Quest to save her was the best.  [It also helps that the 8-bit nostalgia is strong with me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad-k3Iu45Ss)

2) **Yoshiwara in Flames**: Probably my favorite epic arc.  Kagura going all out, Gin-san defeating the king of the Yato.  I also ship Gintoki with Tsukuyo pretty hard too, so there's that.

1) **Gintama: The Movie: The Final Chapter: Be Forever Yorozuya**: Gotta be the 2nd Movie.  It's the perfect movie and the perfect Gintama story.  Just everything about it is hilarious, and heart-felt, and nonstop insanity.  God, at the end when [spoiler](/s "everyone starts disappearing and starts joking about, I died of laughter, then immediately shed tears at Gintoki, Kagura, and Shinpachi's farewells")

Ending of episode 219 and episode 220 where they go to the bath house. [Hardest I have ever laughed](http://imgur.com/SCvhgoW)

Those two episodes were like combo breakers. Literally couldn't stop laughing throughout both of them, gasping for air but the gags where coming in so hard and fast like some lighting fast combos, and it just kept combo-ing me until I had to pause the video.

I still can't believe this was written by an ape...
>> ARTICLE
Episode 35 [spoiler] (/s "where Matsudara tries to kill his daughter's boyfriend. It was just awesome imo.")
>> ARTICLE
IMO, the episode when it happens again (115? I can't remember) was the one I nearly pissed myself watching. I had to pause at the scene with Hijikata as the Mayo prince to get my shit together and calm down before continuing. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the follow up episode was awesome as well. In general i love when Gintama does romance cause the end result is always something ridiculous xD.

Oh, Gintama, please return on air!

[Episode 153](http://www.crunchyroll.com/gintama/episode-153-sleep-helps-a-child-grow-524634)

It's the episode that made me watch the show, and it's still my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
(to preface ive only seen the first 100 episodes of gintama)

Episode 35

I really enjoyed the finish up of Love doesnt require a manual. But what really stood out to me was the second part: You Can't Judge a Person by His Appearance, Either.

It's one of the funniest and best shinsegumi episodes. Everything from them making the guy poo himself to firing a mayora 13 cannon. I saw this episode months ago and If i had to try and hook someone on gintama I would show them this episode.

Katsura in jail. lmao

Not sure if it's 34 or 35 but when all the characters are worried about being cancelled I was crying.

The two episodes where the gang run a barber shop
  I was pissing myself from beginning to end.
>> ARTICLE
For me it's episode 111 part B, which most people would recognize as Kagura's Umbrella episode.

Seriously, that episode is just a big daaaaaw moment with Kagura showing her cute side which is on itself not very common. I guess it's really hard to explain with words but I love how towards the end you can see the bond that the 3 have formed [Spoiler](/s "while walking under Kagura's broken umbrella.")

Also, Happy Independence Day.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 153. It's the hardest I've ever laughed at anything in my entire life. It just goes to show that you NEVER know what Gintama will throw at you. It's also a demonstration of the talent of Tomokazu Sugita and Kugimiya Rie, as they turn what would probably be a boring episode about the characters not being able to sleep into a laugh-fest.

50 - the first of second season... the most random IMO and the most beautiful for that same reason

>> ARTICLE
I've only seen a little over 50 episodes, but I my favorites are 34 and 35. I remember watching 34 and having to try really hard to not wake anyone up, and my friend who got me into the show just said, "I can guarantee 35 will be funnier." and she was pretty much right! I'm also a fan of any with Otae, Katsura, and the shinsengumi.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, you're a bit late to the party :)
But yeah, keep watching. Gintama will NOT dissapoint you
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even realize how old the post was! I don't use reddit very much so I was just searching through this subreddit, sorry! That's exciting though, I've been watching some of it today, and I always end up wishing I had more time for it, because it always makes me feel nice :D 
>> ARTICLE
Haha yeah it's fine man. It really doesn't matter to me how old it is~
Hope you're enjoying the BEST show in the world man!! Cheers!
And also, Happy Thanksgiving :)
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely one of my favorites right now! Happy Thanksgiving to you too :D
>> ARTICLE
Question, can I just watch all the good episodes as Gintama is episodic for the most part or do I need to watch from the beginning?
>> ARTICLE
the beginning can get a bit boring.get through that and there are comedic gems throught most episodes
>> ARTICLE
You should watch from the beginning. The beginning sets the setting and introduces the characters. It's long, but it's worth it if you just power through them. And it's a good enough series that you can do it without feeling so stressed out.
>> ARTICLE
i don't what to choose, everything is awesome, the best appearance goes to elizabeth in second movie, love it!!

Episode 140 - Beware Those That Use Umbrellas on Sunny Days

The opening scene is just pure, unadulterated Gintama; it's very essence. Plus the whole thing with that one guy.
>> ARTICLE
I stopped watching it after about 15 episodes because it didn't grab my interest so I'm going to go with...

That one episode I saw a gif of where the large cat was pummeling the bird costume looking thing while numbers were over their heads. 

That was pretty funny but I'm not watching a hundred episodes looking for it.

Edit: this thing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UobiSJTfZoI

Edit 2: wow got shit on for not liking Gintama. Can't say I didn't expect it.
>> ARTICLE
You got shit on mainly because your comment had nothing to do with "your favourite gintama episode". Not "How was your Gintama experience." or something of that sort.

This would have been helpful a few weeks ago when I explained to my friend why he had suddenly started enjoying Fairy Tail a lot less.

Autocorrect gone wild?
>> ARTICLE
I can't even watch the new Fairy Tail, having enjoyed the original series quite a bit. I don't know what it is but I just can't take it seriously anymore. They also seem to be really fascinated with Lucy's cow tits.
>> ARTICLE
Implying that Fairy Tail was supposed to be taken seriously in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
You should probably just stop then.  I read the manga and I can tell you the fanservice actually increases.  I'd say it even became ecchi.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I stopped. I stopped 4 or 5 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Man. I've had Fairy Tail on my watch list for a while now but I guess I'll just toss it in that case.
>> ARTICLE
Good news for me. Wendy is mai waifu.
>> ARTICLE
Livin' up to your username.

Don't think there'll be much loli ecchi action from what I've seen, only hints and stuff [](/s "in the opposite world")
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been keeping up with fairy tail, but I thought the 1 year break was so they didn't have to do a bunch of filler? or was i mistaken.
>> ARTICLE
Correct, the animation is now a good bit behind the manga. Of course, after this arc, they -could- do filler instead of moving on to the current arc, I guess it depends on how long they want to wait until the next hiatus. 

>> ARTICLE
Don't know, don't watch it myself.

My friend just started talking to me about how the story arc he was on felt pointless and meandering, and I said "Hey, that sounds familiar", and some checking of wikipedia seemed to indicate that the things that he was describing didn't happen in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
They drag on minor fights, and there is a significantly lesser amount of pure ass kicking or badassness. I guess the pacing is slow and feels like barely anything happens in each episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I used to watch fairy tail a while ago but havnt gotten back to it fine it stopped and restarted.  I loved it 4 the pure awesomeness and ass kicking as well but I don't think itd grown that bad I mean ive been meaning to Get back to It but reading this thread I only see bad reviews.  Im also sort of disappointed this anime doesnt Get broughtup more...i mean i think it can do wewell on toonami. Come on guys think of natsu!
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently slugging through the new Fairy Tail and they keep stopping in the middle of fights to spout 2-3 episodes worth of exposition and banter. Then when the battle is finally over they stop off with a cliffhanger for some plot movement. Gotta say, it's getting harder and harder to watch Fairy Tail. I just want to see some ass get kicked and maybe an episode with real consequences for stuff like [Minor Spoiler](/s "Arcadios walking through god damn lava").
>> ARTICLE
Nothing in Fairy Tail having consequences, nobody getting hurt and just making rules up as they go really turned me off. But it's really to late to stop watching now.. :/
>> ARTICLE
Gintoki is the best at explaining stuff, the episode where he worked as an editor for Shonen Jump or the times where he revealed the different methods animators use to win time  it feels like the director and staff at "Sunrise" communicate their feeling and approaches to us through the anime

Hanger x Hanger, a manga about a young pilot named Prop who goes in search of his father who left home to get his pilot's license. To do this, prop must brave the challenges of the pilot's exam to get his own license.

Another series that has similar synopsis is Uchuu Kyoudai (Space Brothers). It's like Astronaut X Astronaut... The feelings I feel during the entire NASA exam was definitely the same feelings I had during Hunter X Hunter's hunter exam. Full of adventure and "what's next challenge?!".
>> ARTICLE
During his search, he ends up meeting another pilot, Jet. Jet is currently tracking a new threat to the skies. Joining up with Jet, our heroes meet the Diemora Wasps, a deadly insect species that has evolved to the point where they threaten to take over the entire sky.

How will Prop and his best friend Protector (a son of a famous police family) survive this new threat to the skies?

And in time, he learns to channel his inner Zen to radically improve his piloting and find peace.

Even though we're joking right now.. I really hope I get to see more anime of that manga.. It's so damn good.

For those who don't know much about Gintama, I'll let Gin give tell you the [point](http://static.fjcdn.com/gifs/Not+even+the+main+character+has+faith....+Sakata+Gintoki+of_d18336_4505695.gif) of the show and give you a [summary](http://53rg10.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/gintama_125-00.jpg) 
>> ARTICLE
If I want to get into the show, should I start at the beginning? or at the most current episode? are there any good ones that stand out?
>> ARTICLE
Watch roughly from the beginning, maybe the first 10 eps then from 25ish? It does take a while to get rolling.
>> ARTICLE
Okay,  thanks! 
>> ARTICLE
So ti's basically seinfeld the anime?
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is one of my absolute favourite anime, I crack a rib everytime
>> ARTICLE
So what, it's just shit happening just for the sake of shit happening? That actually sounds pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
Its basically like a kids cartoon where all they have is characters and settings and they point of the episodes are to make you laugh, there isn't any goal or plot going on beyond the current episode or the very small arcs
>> ARTICLE
So like the Seinfeld of anime?
>> ARTICLE
Basically. 

Though it's also well known for parodying just about every other anime. It's pretty cool if you've watched a lot of anime; there's a fuckton of references. 
>> ARTICLE
Lucky Star is probably the Seinfeld of anime; it has even less purpose
>> ARTICLE
It's much more adorable though

Daily lives of high school boys is probably more like Seinfeld. Sitcom where the main characters are dudes and a realistic setting.

I just kind of stopped watching it around episode 15. I'll get back to it eventually, but it kind of felt like, 1/3 of the jokes were good, 1/3 couldn't be translated properly, and 1/3 were just weird or normal things that were over the top.

That's quite the strong argument for watching it.

Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is the only one I recognize.

That picture randomly skips some pretty famous roles of his like Joseph Joestar and then used random fan art for quite a few of the other famous roles.
>> ARTICLE
It's also missing his video game roles, like Chrom from Fire Emblem Awakening.
>> ARTICLE
And *GAUNTLET HADES* Ragnarok The *INFERNO DIVIDER* BloodEdge
>> ARTICLE
Basically yes. the anime is extremely episodic. The arcs are 1,2,3 episodes long. A lot of single episodes, only a few arcs that are longer that 5,6 episodes. And there is not really an underlying goal for the plot or much developement. If I were to compare it to western animation, it would be the same as asking what's going on with Simpsons. They are not going anywhere, they just are. The same goes with Gintama. It just is, and it's hilarious. Gintama's main genre is comedy. Yes, there are serious arcs and moments and some plot and when they are, it's awesome, but it's just a 'bonus'. Gintama is all bout yorozuya shenanigans, references, annihilating the fourth wall, stupidity and fun.
>> ARTICLE
You forgot to mention the epic arcs. Every now and them, there'll be an a some what long arc of baddassery and awesomeness that rivals most shounens.

Reminds me a lot of Nichijou.

Just keep in mind the series starts off a little weak, but really comes into it's own shortly after.
>> ARTICLE
About when does it start to pick up? I'm 12 episodes in and have at most gotten a sensible chuckle out of it.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I saw the early episodes, so I couldn't tell you. However it's entirely possible that the humor of the show simply doesn't work for you.

The show does a lot of cultural reference humor which can fall flat or completely sail over your head if you aren't aware.

Personally, I felt the show just got better and better, but your mileage may vary.
>> ARTICLE
It's worth it. But, just don't expect any coherent plot.

Do expect excellent humor, and recurring characters galore.

Yes, it's a funny concept they call "anime"

Why be sarcastic? separate Gifs with text are horrible. A video of the scene is better. I came to the comments for the video the moment I saw it was more than one image. He was specifically asking for a link to the scene in question, something that happens in every post like this one.

On episode 99 right now. I don't usually like situational comedy, but for some reason I find that the anime setting lets it really go over the top (example: entire episode of characters on the toilet). Also some of the finest moral education known to man (often there are layers upon layers of social comentary burried in the scenes).

TL;DR If you are going to watch something longer than 24 eps, watch this.
>> ARTICLE
Where could I find this? I enjoy situational comedy and this seems like something I would like but I cant find it on the one site I use and I am afraid to just search willy nilly.  If you have a trusted site please share lol

>> ARTICLE
It's hosted on Crunchyroll. They're pretty trusted around here; anything they stream is licensed. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks a ton! I will check it out.

Both the episode you were referring to, and episode 99 are my favourite episodes of any anime, ever.

Always good to see more Gintama on this sub
>> ARTICLE
I still mourn what Claymore could have been as an anime :_(
>> ARTICLE
What about Berserk? 

Holy cow was that the bleakest ever ending for an anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Same for Berserk, back when it aired in 97 it covered what was available of Miura's manga, with a slight change to have a proper-ish ending, I'm almost a 100% certain that we will have an other adaptation of Berserk sooner or later , it's just a matter of time before a studio jumps on it considering how popular it is (who knows studio 4C might just adopt more in that movie format )  
>> ARTICLE
I personally jumped straight to the manga, things get interestingly more complicated, some great plot twists and shocking reveals, you should check it out 
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga first before watching the anime, which made it more painful. With the exception of the final episode, the anime was very well done and true to the manga. Oh well, that's life, I guess.

The manga is exceptionally good, if anyone is considering reading it. It truly is epic with a very twisted style that will appeal to some. One of my favourites for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
The final episode actually made me rage, but the manga has almost made me forget about it.
>> ARTICLE
Well there was nothing that could be done, when MadHouse adopted the manga, they worked on what was available of the source material , eventually they got to the infamous cross road , which of the two evils to choose from, a filler ending or an open ending (like berserk,slam dunk...) ^^^leaving ^^^fans ^^^painfully^^^hanging^^^for^^a^^new^season ,and they went with a filler one 
>> ARTICLE
I guess to be fair, the manga didn't really have a 'proper' ending, either. Sigh. 

I think Claymore would be an excellent candidate for a reboot, although I wonder if recent/newer anime fans would be interested in that type of story? 
>> ARTICLE
We've heard a lot about reboots of old shows and Claymore has always been mentioned , who knows MadHouse might do it one day, they won't rely on it's small fan-base though, it'll be kinda like HxH just start fresh and target the manga fans 
>> ARTICLE
> I guess to be fair, the manga didn't really have a 'proper' ending, either. Sigh.

Assuming you are still talking about Claymore and not berserk or some other manga, the Claymore manga had a time skip, but has had new chapters fairly regularly since then. Chapters are only released 1-2 times a month, more likely only once or slightly less.

Yeah around the time the original FMA adopted what was available of the manga Bones studios went with the last option there which was to use a filler second half instead of waiting on the manga 
>> ARTICLE
well, they tried to continue the story instead of straight up filler. If I remember correctly, they even said that King Bradley's secretary was their mother (or at least an homonculus created when they tried to bring back their mother, and that's why she looked like her). I think she didn't even appear in Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. They simply did the homunculus a lot better. Making each one a reincarnation of a failed human transmutation was great. 
>> ARTICLE
That was Lust wasnt it?

>> ARTICLE
After searching a bit, it was [Sloth](http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Sloth_(2003_anime\)).
>> ARTICLE
Ah, My bad. Its been a while since I watched it:)
>> ARTICLE
post?
>> ARTICLE
sorry, pre*
>> ARTICLE
I'd say the original Full Metal Alchemist did quite well with diverging from the manga. Personally I liked the original far better than brotherhood, the original had much better character development
>> ARTICLE
But Brotherhood is the actual story.
>> ARTICLE
I prefer Brotherhood. It felt more proactive and complete.

When watching the original I always felt like Ed and Al where about to curl into a ball and cry over every little thing. In Brotherhood, they sucked it up an actually worked out their problems.

I also enjoyed that Winry and Rose actually did shit in this series. I hated that they made Rose a princess to save in original.
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood is great as long as you watch the first 25 episodes of the FMA first, and then continue with I think around episode 10 of brotherhood. 
>> ARTICLE
That whole Rose situation was like a million times darker than anything Brotherhood had. I still preferred Brotherhood but you have a point.
>> ARTICLE
The scene with Nina Tucker was far better in the original, but overall, I prefered Brotherhood because it felt complete.
>> ARTICLE
That's because that was when the anime was still behind the manga. And because the part had already been done in the first Anime, Brotherhood rushed through it.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 6 is basically what happened to Sekirei :(
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain why anime and manga are written in katakana? I sort of get why anime is written like that but shouldn't it still be in hiragana? 

I was also confused when Japanese companies which have their global HQ in Japan had their names in Katakana instead of hiragana. 
>> ARTICLE
It has to do with emphasis, in the case of the companies. Think of it like bold letters in english. 
>> ARTICLE
That and  is cruise control for cool

I kid.
>> ARTICLE
Anime is a foreign word. It comes from the English word 'animation', so it's written in katakana. Manga is probably just written that way to make it easier to read. Sometimes that's done with words where people don't see the kanji that often, they just write it in katakana so it can be read phonetically. Usually straight hiragana is for grammatical purposes, so they don't write something like a noun in hiragana often.

Companies use katakana because they're names. Same sorta thing, it shows that it's a proper noun. Hiragana usually indicates a Japanese word, usually grammar. But to some degree, it's just stylization. Like some companies just use romaji.
>> ARTICLE
Anime is a loan word. Loan words are written in katakana, almost always.

Manga is more of an emphasis thing, yes, but seeing it written in kanji is common. Kanji tends to have a serious/official ring to it, but writing it in katakana can help lighten things a little bit.
>> ARTICLE
Is that last one a CLAMP joke?
>> ARTICLE
It happens a lot. Revolutionary Girl Utena, for instance. Gin's probably referring so a shounen series though, considering how he's a big Jump fan.
>> ARTICLE
Really? Whacky. 
>> ARTICLE
could someone give me an example of the last one? where both change so much they cant rejoin? i really cant see how that would happen 
>> ARTICLE
Rosario+Vampire comes to mind. I believe this happened with Arpeggio of Blue Steel: Ars Nova and Negima too. 
>> ARTICLE
Original FMA. FMA Brotherhood followed the manga to the end.
>> ARTICLE
To a point the original FMA anime wasn't even intending to rejoin with the manga storyline once it became clear enough that there wouldn't be enough material (about 3-5 episodes in IIRC) even going as far as using the story from one of the light novels as episodes rather then a movie as one might expect.
>> ARTICLE
thanks

>> ARTICLE
Poor Rurouni Kenshin...
>> ARTICLE
Not all fillers were bad, although they didn't live up the Kyouto arc. And I was ok with the *Seisou Hen* OVA (although its pacing is a bit awkward). 

My only gripes is that the rest of the manga weren't animated and probably never will. Because most of the fans grew up, it's more profitable to make it live action instead.
>> ARTICLE
The Jinchu arc is the best of Kenshin though, and sadly, we will never get to see it animated, all thanks to lousy filler!
>> ARTICLE
When I saw the episode about the Neo Armstrong Cannon (google it) the anime had me hooked.  Never laughed so much at an anime.
>> ARTICLE
[let's pimp out Gintama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlhKkk-c3WE)
>> ARTICLE
This is how one piece has become as well
>> ARTICLE
Eh no not really. One Piece doesn't have that much filler comparatively to other series. It had a 3 episode filler arc to bridge Punk Hazard and Dressrosa, but other than that no. There have been a few scenes on Dressrosa such as Sanji and Violet going around town and the scene between Zoro and Fujitora outside the bar.

Other than that it has just dragged it by doing a 1:1 ratio chapter to episode. It does need filler after this (incredibly long) arc.
>> ARTICLE
From what little I actually observe of One Piece's anime/manga, the story is functionally really simple but the only reason it has gone on so long (with relatively little filler) is because of exceptionally padded scenes that allow the anime to keep or remove unimportant parts as needed to not actually *need* fillers.

An example would be Dragon Ball Z which only had the Garlic Jr. Saga as an actual filler arc and might have tossed in a filler episode here or there as needed to not had largely undesired filler arcs (ironically, if DBZ had filler arcs/more fillere episodes in some places the movies would be able to be included in the same timeline, not that they *have* to be but it would be interesting if they did).

Something on the other hand would be Bleach which has filler arcs because there is very little excess material to strip out or leave in to *not* run out of content for episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Some of their filler arcs are actually pretty good though, I'd take that any day over mindless filler or padded episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I thought they were more towards the DBZ style of anime where you just extend scenes with lots of stills, stare downs and yelling.
>> ARTICLE
Yea it also what I meant, not fillers in the actual sense. I just mean they really take a long round about kind of boring way to stay behind the manga by adding all kind of non mange scenes in each episode.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't understand how animes can catch up to mangas anyway. It seems like the process of creating a chapter in a manga would be much faster than an episode, which probably takes several months to animate.
>> ARTICLE
Manga's usually follow a release schedule that keeps the pace slower and anime usually covers multiple chapters in one episode.
>> ARTICLE
1 episode of Naruto or bleach = 4-6 chapters. That's how.
>> ARTICLE
The time an episode takes to be produced is irrelevant here, for continues series there will be an episode each week no matter what, it depends on the number of chapters adopted into one episode, it varies from one director to another but generally one Episode from an anime covers 2 to 3 chapters, so catching up is inevitable 
>> ARTICLE
But then they should just wait till they have a season (or a cour) worth of material built up in the manga before they make the anime for it.
>> ARTICLE
You don't get paid for not doing work.
>> ARTICLE
If we assume that one episode takes only 2 chapters (for simplicity sake, let's say it's always 2 chapters never more or less), and assume that there is one chapter and one episode released a week, even with a season worth of material (somewhere in the area of 3-4 manga novels worth), the anime will catch up at the end of the second season since it uses up twice as much material as is being produced, but at the same speed (and anime don't go on breaks the way live action shows do, except in some cases (looks at FT)).

If they wait till there is two seasons worth of material built up but still use 2 chapters to each episode, the anime will catch up by about the end of the fourth season (assuming ~20 episode seasons), which (using Bleach as an example) stands out since the fourth and fifth season are filler arcs, and has a filler as every fourth season up till the 15 which was a filler to allow more material produced presumably so that there could be an arc (maybe 2 seasons worth) after the 16th then all of the final arc unbroken by inexcusable filler arcs (looking at you Bleach seasons 9 and 13. 11 is excusable because there is basically no good place to put it that wouldn't seem out of place, but would interrupt the action if put in at a point where the information provided in it would resolve any confusions/questions).
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing that says seasons of an anime have to be put out on a fixed schedule, though, and they often don't.  Just look at _Durarara!!_; S1 aired Q1 and Q2 2010; S2 is coming out, but we don't even know when yet.
>> ARTICLE
Usually the contents of a manga chapter aren't enough material to sustain 20 minutes of new animation in a show. It varies a bit from series to series depending on how much of that space is spent on action. 
>> ARTICLE
a shounen manga will generally go to 3 chapters an episode. since shounen jump is released weekly, it would take 1 month of manga to equate to 1 episode's worth of material.

so if an anime catches up it would generally take 1 year of chapters to make 1 cour (1 12 episode season).

for manga that are released on a monthly timeline, usually it's 2:1 ratio, but even then 1 year equates to ~ 6 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Or they can do like One Piece and have a really long opening and a recap so that you only need to show 15 minutes of anime and you make sure to show every scene from every angle.
>> ARTICLE
is there a youtube link to this?
>> ARTICLE
Or they just stop and wait forever and leave massive cliffhangers. Freakin' titans.
>> ARTICLE
I'm cool with the same characters making a totally different anime. I never really understood why people would get up in arms when a tv show/movie doesn't follow the book exactly. I just fucking read that. Why would I pay to watch what I've already read? I want something new for my time and money not the same rehashed shit in a different medium.

I know I'm in the minority though.
>> ARTICLE
The problem lays on the fact that these anime follow a certain source material that reflects the creativity of the creator and communicates the plot, story and characters written by a certain person, then in the middle rely on different writers, that always results in jarring inconsistency, it's not the case all the time but 99% anime just die with fillers 
>> ARTICLE
and then there's Ghost in the Shell
>> ARTICLE
I've tried watching Gintama before, but I just can't get into it... I've heard it gets better but I just can't bring myself to watch THAT much unenjoyable content first. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy so dumb people might have a hard time getting into it.
>> ARTICLE
I was fortunate enough to have caught a few of the later episodes on TV found them to be amazing then decided to watch it online from the start, the beginning was definitely weak so I just blasted through it quickly, I don't think you have to watch the first episodes if you find them boring, juts watch the few important ones with character introduction and skip the rest  
>> ARTICLE
You can pretty much start anywhere. The first few episodes aren't as good as the rest of the show.
>> ARTICLE
> I've heard it gets better but I just can't bring myself to watch THAT much unenjoyable content first. 

You make it sound like it only gets better after 100 episodes or something. But that's not the case - it should become enjoyable fairly quickly. If not, it may not be for you at all.
>> ARTICLE
It's like Detective Conan in a sense where some episodes are the most funny/amazing thing you've ever seen, and then some just fall flat. It's the way it goes for mangas like gintama. It's really good though and you'll have some of your own favorite episodes to tell everyone about when you start watching more.
>> ARTICLE
It's something you'll either love or just don't like. I didn't think it was the best at the beginning- far from it. However once I got further in I started to love almost every episode bar a few. 

I introduced to a friend recently and he's been burning through the series and definitely found it hilarious. 

There's not much to it.
>> ARTICLE
it's generally well known that you pretty much have to get anywhere between 12-20 episodes in before it really shines. it came out when a shinsengumi drama was popular, so it kinda rode the train and when the drama ended you could tell the mangaka finally got a hang of what he wanted to do.

Gintama is my exception to the 3 episode rule.
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah I understand that. I'm just saying that some may love it from the get-go. I have plenty of exceptions to the 3 episode rule but that's me personally. 
>> ARTICLE
Or they make so much filler that people lose interest and the anime is canceled before the manga ever gets much further and people are left hanging.

You know who you are, guilty parties

I like how Tsukuyo tried to help gintoki the whole time.

Character popularity arc? That makes me wanna watch Gintama... love that kind of stuff.

Umineko Tsubasa (VN+manga) had something similar to that, so yea.
>> ARTICLE
There is pretty much no 4th wall in Gintama, they are fully aware they are in a manga/anime.  One of my favorite episodes of Gintama is Episode 50 where they brainstorm ideas to shake up the show so that it doesn't get cancelled and its hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is amazing. I definitely reccomend it. The entire Arc is just characters pissed about rankings so they try to lower others rankings to get top tier.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw8-o2D9Sh0) quick 10 second one always makes me laugh too.


If anyone is reading this and not sure if they should start watching Gintama: yes you should.  It really is that good.  It took me quite a few episodes to "get' it, but now that I do it's easily my 2nd favorite anime of all time (HxH has my top spot).

I remember watching that first clip during the episode. Couldn't hold back the tears

Then dat ending had me in tears (of laughter)

My favorite episode is probably still the one where Katsura goes to driving school. 

The moment I knew this was my favorite show was the episode where they search for a fan "sanpuuki." I watched it with my Japanese roommate when I was in Japan and he thought I was borderline mental because of how much I was laughing it.

nozaki kun was hilarious, i loved it. too bad it's so short.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was glad they at least managed to adapt the beach storyline as a series of "specials." That storyline contained one of the funniest jokes from the manga (although it wasn't quite as good in the anime imo).
>> ARTICLE
Guessing game time. Has to be the "I almost did something illegal" line?
>> ARTICLE
Nah. I liked when Nozaki-kun said he drew Mamiko based on Mikoshiba's face when Sakura threw their swim trunks away (accidentally). Nozaki is just so happy about it.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei is a good rival, but its comedy is more satirical than Gintama's slapstick style.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama has political satire, trope (in manga, anime) satire, social satire, etc. 


Sayonara is more mature thought, and it's way more centered in political and social satire. 


Anyways, both are awesome. Some of the best comedy mangas out there.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama has some minor satire, but yeah, SZS is way darker and more satirical.

As a side note: Tomokazu appears in SZS, as the guy who fetishises the past, Ikkyu. 
>> ARTICLE
SZS is probably my favorite bit of dark humor to come out of Japan.

Yeah. I'm amazed it lasted two series, an OVA, yet another series, and another OVA. It seemed way too weird. Even by anime standards.

Gintama's former assistant was the one who **created** Sket Dance. Not just the anime. That's why the two is very similar and they are buds enough to do a crossover.

Ugh but there are like a thousand shows I'm supposed to be watching.

There was also a point in the anime when they switched over from 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9 and they couldn't decide what to do with the extra space on the sides. They actually acknowledge the change though and it's great.

Holy shit this clip made me wanna watch it now! 

But then I see there's 270 episodes!! Q A Q

One Piece is hard enough as it is!
>> ARTICLE
Tsukky is my favourite character from Gintama other than the main characters, followed by Tama-chan.  I also really like the VA for Sa-chan and her character.  

The episode where Gintoki was talking to Tsukky about a spider then shocked by a spider on his hand was absolutely brilliant!
>> ARTICLE
IIRC in the original airing Gintama was moved from an afternoon slot to an evening slot around that magic 25 episode mark. The humour got much better and dirtier.
>> ARTICLE
gintama is the funniest thing ive ever seen in any medium
>> ARTICLE
Too many funny moments to choose from.
>> ARTICLE
MY SIDES, this is fucking funny.
>> ARTICLE
The entire arc was my favorite from the series. It had just the right balance of humor and tense situations. 
>> ARTICLE
The scene that had me laughing the hardest out of all Gintama is when Katsura takes driving lessons and they arrive at the "train station."

Basically, the episode joke is that the driving instructor tells them to take into account anything that might happen while driving, to be safe, but...well, it's best in context of the entire episode, so really, [just watch the entire episode.](http://www.crunchyroll.com/gintama/episode-72-a-dogs-paws-smell-fragrant-drive-with-a-might-attitude-510206)

edit: also the "hot pot Shogun" episode
>> ARTICLE
that face Shinpachi makes will always be my favorite, props to the artist for capturing that look of absolute disgust.
>> ARTICLE
This is one show I cant get into. I havn't laughed at it that I know of through 16 episodes. It's ok but does it ever get any better?
>> ARTICLE
Plow through the first 25 episodes to let the series get into it's rhythm, and the rest of the series is more or less at this level. 
>> ARTICLE
*Obviously this is just my personal anecdote and everybody's taste is different, and that's fine.*

People will tell you to wait through 25 episodes but don't listen if you don't like it by now. I tried to believe everybody that it would get better but It just never clicked for me after **36** episodes. Honestly if you don't like it by now I don't think you should waste your time.

I really didn't like the humor style. Why Shinpachi, why do you have to overexplain every single fucking joke or gag, and in that weird exaggerated outraged tone every single time? Like wtf, how does that not get old for some people? Whatever, I'm not gonna hate on people for liking something I don't like, good for them.
>> ARTICLE
People are wrong, series slowly starts picking it up starting from episode  38. I consider myself as Gintama fan and dragged myself through the first 37 episodes in my last rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't set 38 as a hard number where it gets good at either, I've seen people say ~50. And personally for me I liked it from the start. Everyone's sense of humour is different and it can take varying lengths before it clicks, but I think given enough time and patience Gintama is extremely rewarding.
>> ARTICLE
No, I would set 38 as a very good number. It's the Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon episode, which is one of the first really funny episodes. In episode 39 we get the episode with Katsura and Ikumatsu, which was also very solid. Starting from episode 40 Umibozu will make an appearance with an short story arc with Kagura. 

The episodes after that are all better than those in the beginning until the Benizakura arc starts. 

Episode 38 was indeed a breaking point of this series for me.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama as a whole continues to get better as it progresses, though. My point being, 38 might be a turning point for you but it might not be for the person you were replying to, as they were previously told by others that the bar is at 25 and that's not wrong either. Shinpachi is also going to 'overexplain' every joke since that's his role and it isn't going to stop at episode 38, so maybe it really just isn't the right show for them.
>> ARTICLE
>It's ok but does it ever get any better?

At this point I almost can't tell anymore whether these comments are bait. Literally every single time gintama is talked about there will be a person asking this exact question. I've seen it dozens of times. And in a way it almost feels like people asking that question don't deserve to watch it sort of. 
>> ARTICLE
I remember back when I started that the first one or two seasons had a very weird feeling to them... like nothing made sense and it didn't seem the show had any structure nor was it really funny but it gets better shortly after. I think around episode 40 it should be full steam ahead.

I must admit though that I stopped watching around episode 113 because I realized that the lack of an overarching main plot and the episodic nature of the show couldn't keep me interested much longer. Also the fact that every episode was either complete hit-or-miss didn't help much either.
>> ARTICLE
It definitely gets better. I'm up to episode 70 and it has been becoming more and more consistently funny for me (or just plain good for its serious/poignant moments). Others have said that the first 24 episodes or so don't do the series justice, and I'd have to agree. I didn't really laugh until episode 18 and 25. Then the show starts hitting its stride and you get a better feel for what direction the show is actually headed.

The show has a strong following and from what I've heard, the show just keeps getting better and better. Having said that, not *everyone* has the same taste in humor so YMMV. 
>> ARTICLE
Some episodes are hilarious others are so so or serious  it's still a great series. 
>> ARTICLE
People are saying this is one of the funniest Gintama scenes but I don't think it's that great. It is funny, but if this is the best Gintama has got, then I don't think it's worth it for me to watch.
>> ARTICLE
151-152 was my favorite arc so far
>> ARTICLE
If that is not funny, you are a lost soul in a sea of pessimism. That scene is funny but IMO, but hardly is one of the funniest.
>> ARTICLE
Personal preference varies of course. I find this scene funny but not the best Gintama has to offer for example. Having more context always helps as well.
>> ARTICLE
This one isn't that funny for me either. There are plenty of other funny ones.
>> ARTICLE
I think episodes 88 and 89 were the funniest so far (I'm only up to 96).
>> ARTICLE
It's a great scene, but it's not even close to the best scene. However, it does come from one of the best arcs in the series. 

I find this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7uIPCy0Wg8

Is a pretty good "trailer" for what Gintama is like, without any spoilers. It's really an experience, and everyone will point to a different scene and say "this is the best part" because everyone gets something different out of the show. I think it's worth a try, and once you've finished the Benizakura arc, you'll know whether it's your type of show or not.

>> ARTICLE
This scene isn't even close to the best of gintama by a long shot, the show's had way better moments throughout it's 270 episodes. But I will say Gintama is definitely more of an acquired taste, so if you don't like Japanese humor/references you probably will not enjoy the show as much.
>> ARTICLE
Realistically you can't jump in to the middle of a scene in the middle of a show in the middle of the series and get the full effect.  *Gintama* is a really funny show, but you really have to watch it from the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
I may just watch this now.. never realized how hilarious it is. I loled through the whole thing.
>> ARTICLE
God dam that scene was boring for me. I guess its not my sense of humour 
>> ARTICLE
Umm i hope I'm not the only who didn't laugh at this. 
>> ARTICLE
You're not alone
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Gintama yet, and I didn't find this as funny as the title and comments suggested. However, Gintama has been on my PTW for ages. Are all the jokes in the show like this? Do I need to understand the character better? 
>> ARTICLE
You start from ep 1. It will keep you laughing for ages.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say there's a good variety of humor. There's absurdist humor, slapstick, parodies or references (anime and pop culture), breaking the fourth wall, running gags, poking fun at common tropes (moe, shonen-related, etc.), and more. And yes, understanding how the characters and their quirks play off of each other only adds to the humor.

It can require some patience though. The first 24 episodes or so didn't appeal to me, but it got significantly better, grew on me, and now I'm just enjoying the ride (I'm up to episode 70). It's still hit or miss at this point, but there's a lot more hits than misses for me. YMMV.
>> ARTICLE
Do yourself a favor and start watching from episode 3, 1-2 aren't that good 
>> ARTICLE
well this joke get used later on in the same arc so the second time its kinda funny
>> ARTICLE
The jokes in Gintama are pretty varied. And knowing the character plays a big part in most of the jokes. For example, knowing who the kid is, and knowing what the arc is about, is pretty important for the set up of the joke.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, you need to understand the characters better. Personally this moment wasn't that funny for me but there are a lot of better ones.
>> ARTICLE
I would prefer it if they didn't shout out explaining the joke. "He's acting like it never happened!" ...yes, I got that. 
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, if you don't like that, Japanese comedy in general might mot be for you. 
>> ARTICLE
might not*
>> ARTICLE
K...i dont think its funny
>> ARTICLE
Lol, watch episode 270
>> ARTICLE
I started watching this anime but couldn't get through it, seems like I did miss something later on

Great scene! :)
>> ARTICLE
Can't blame you, the first 37 sucked besides episode 25. Comedy starts getting good with episode 38 and the first good storyarc begins with the Benizakura Arc in episode 58.
>> ARTICLE
The first few set up a rather interesting setup, which made me really curious. Then it just dragged on...

Still, tThe setting still sorta intrigues me, and clips like this remind me that I do like Gin's personality.

If I were to revisit this anime, where do you suggest I start watching from? episode 58?
>> ARTICLE
Most people will tell you to start from the beginning, I would at least start from episode 38, comedy is getting better from there. Instead of watching the TV episodes of the Benizakura arc, watch the movie instead. It's the same with better animation.

The later parts of the series is nothing like the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Usually I would start from the beginning, but since I did start watching the series (be it years ago) I figured I shouldn't do it again, there is a reason I stopped watching back then.

Also, there is a gintama movie??
>> ARTICLE
http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/watch_order#wiki_gintama

Start from episode 38 then. It's the 2nd good comedy episode of the series and there will be a short story arc with episode 40, which also shouldn't be missed. 
>> ARTICLE
The lack of story is what I recall as reason for dropping it.

Thank you! :)

I've never watched Gintama, nor do I have a large desire to, but this scene was pretty funny. The voice and mannerisms reminded me of Danshi Nichijou, so I looked it up, and it turns out that Tomokazu Sugita voices both Gin and Hidenori. That kind of humor is hilarious

Should I start from episode 1? I heard from my friends that the comedy in the first episodes are quite stale.

There's only so many rom-coms worth watching, my friend.

I just can't get into this kind of humor. Just like Nichijou hardly even made me laugh a few times over 30 episodes. I had the suspect that Gintama wasn't the series for me, but now I'm convinced.

Im almost considering giving this a second shot... only got to episode 2 last time i tried like 2 years ago.

Edit: the salt really makes me want to watch now...

Those first two are the worst of the worst.

Thought people knew this already. You're supposed to SKIP the first 2 episodes. They're pilot and have nothing to do with the manga. It's like only watching an anime's filler and judging the entire series on the 2-3 filler episodes that you watched.

yeaaa i didnt have any interest in gintama  and did not hear about this  uhh rule. But with overwhelming support this show gets  im reconsidering

I don't see how anyone can see this as funny, and I am exceedingly accommodating. perhaps its just a type of humor that I don't understand, but at what point was I supposed to laugh? 
>> ARTICLE
you were fine up until that last phrase. how the fuck am I supposed to explain how something's funny? You're asking the impossible, friend. Did you also not like the daily lives of high school boys?
>> ARTICLE
not how, why. I don't understand the joke.
>> ARTICLE
You're still asking for a tall order. Here's an analogy so you understand. You're a coworker of mine; you're a good guy, but sometimes the jokes I say don't resonate with you. I tell a joke to several other coworkers, and you happen to be present. After I tell the joke, everyone's in stitches. I'm the next George Carlin they say. You stand there, look around, and say, "I don't get it. Why's that funny?" We attempt to explain the joke, but of course that doesn't get us anywhere. Why? Because having something that's SUPPOSED to be comedic dies once it's explained; that's why comedic timing is a thing.  I get that you don't find it funny. That's 100% fine. This just isn't your cup of tea. I just can't explain WHY it's funny. 
>> ARTICLE
I get if you don't find this funny, but you don't have to sound like a dick.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly don't see any joke. I want to know why people say this is funny
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if troll, but I'll try to explain it anyway. The joke is in the fact that the characters don't fit into the roles that would be expected in this situation. Gintoki comes in and looks really cool deflecting the kunai but actually failed miserably. He's super embarrassed when he should be more concerned with whether the kid is okay. The attacker Tsukuyo repeatedly tries to cover for Gintoki for no apparent reason, which is funny because she's supposed to be the bad guy in this situation. I feel really dumb actually trying to explain this because it's pretty straightforward.
>> ARTICLE
I see, so would you say the genre of the joke is... deadpan slapstick? this is the first time I have ever seen a 'joke' of this type. moreover I was expecting a joke, but what it really is is a humorous situation with no real punchline, and that was what I was missing.

do you even watch anime? this is one of the most basic types of japanese comedy...

>> ARTICLE
I hope this isn't too late in the thread and enough people will see this. I'll post it again next week.

In the second GinTama movie there are some jokes that are a bit hard to understand if you don't know what's going on, so you should know a few things before going into it.

The most important thing to know is [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT7ijnOHEDs). It's a Japanese anti-piracy ad that started airing before movies in 2007. The character with the camera head has been given the nickname "Eiga Dorobo" which translates to Movie Thief.

The [K-On! Movie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9617/K-On!_Movie) is one of the highest grossing anime movies ever, I think it might even be THE highest grossing anime movie ever.

The movie [The Wind Rises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises) should be current enough that people know about it, but I still mention it.

It appeared many times in Gintama already, but it's always good to remember [Fist of the North Star's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fist_of_the_North_Star) (Hokuto no Ken) distinctive art style and [catchy OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqLie4EgUc).

A Japanese word for sunglasses is "gurasan", and a Japanese word for penis is "chinpo".

Kagura's voice actress, [Kugimiya Rie](http://myanimelist.net/people/8/Rie_Kugimiya), is most famous for voicing stereotypical tsundere characters such as Taiga in Toradora or Louise in Zero no Tsukaima. Basically if there's a tsundere loli in your anime, your number 1 pick for her VA would be Kugimiya Rie.

You should know about the 1980's Japanese pop band [The Checkers](http://www.spirit-of-rock.com/les%20goupes/T/The%20Checkers/pics/01fc_1.jpg). Its singers, two guys called Fumiya and Takamoku (the two guys on the right in the picture I posted), didn't get along, split up, and started solo careers.

There was an idol group called [Ebisu Muscats](http://www.generasia.com/wiki/Ebisu_Muscats), made up entirely from JAV stars (Japanese Adult Video, aka porn) and [gravure idols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravure_idol) (NSFW).

These are the ones I can think of that need explanation. There are probably many more.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the heads up!

> The most important thing to know is this video

Why can't we get such wacky adverts? Their more effective.

>  Kugimiya Rie ... most famous for voicing stereotypical tsundere characters.

I look forward to seeing how this gets referred to in the movie.

>  The Checkers

Their choice of clothing is... very 80's like.
>> ARTICLE
Is anyone talking about the new fight scene with Gin and Katsura? I don't see it being mentioned, because it was heavily expanded on and looked freaking amazing, the fight scenes were so cool and the music made it so much cooler.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that fight scene felt great, maybe even better than Gin - Nizou fight.  
Amanto falling one by one, Zura and Gin cleaning them up neatly. Zura was mostly a gag character so I accidently forgot he was nearly as strong as Gin.  

Also the first fight under the bridge was a lot better too
>> ARTICLE
Is this the only serious arc Zura is a main character in?


>> ARTICLE
Oh shit, guys. Penultimate week. Still doesnt feel real. Expect sappiness come next Saturday.

Original Benizakura commentary [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2dq3qf/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_5661/cjrzkiv) for reference. Dang, I was still calling Elizabeth a "she" and pretending to be serious back then. Wonder what happened along the way. Also, sorry for not being very active at all in the last thread. Was fatigued from driving too much that weekend.

*****

I guess by "Retelling" Fujita meant ~~an interpretive and artistic~~ a cost-cutting series of background shots with "added scenes"

Kagura is my idol ^^Sorry ^^Otsu

Warner brothers is getting some fancy service here

Wait, what? I dont remember Shoyo teasing before.

[Dick Entry  8:20  Kondo  Kondo](http://i.imgur.com/mVd876u.png). Sorry for the delay. Still learning how to edit images.

Heh, they slipped in a popularity poll joke in the Elizabeth routine

Oh god the references to early episodes are going to strain my memory

What the fuck? What are you doing here, Kamui and Abuto?

Dang, did the first confrontation between Nizou and Gin always look this good?

Lake Toya no! 

Man, Shinpachi needs to be badass more often

Ah yes, I remember you, stained-panties joke

OISHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

The extra budget obviously went into Kagura faces

The Shoyo teasing I cant handle all of it

The beast howls, and so does Otae

The level of detail in Nizous arm as Benizakura consumes him makes my stomach churn

I vividly remember it but the "most suspicious person" line still got me

The women of Gintama sure are classy

Oh yeah, this took place before Gintoki x Otae became invalid

Shh, Kagura. Figureheads of ships dont talk.

Seriously, Shinpachi did work this arc

Really like the incorporation of the same dream-like sequence as Nizou heads out to take down the Joi ships

Short hair Katsura HNNNG

So much easier to make sense of the rhetoric and objectives of the opposing factions the second time around

Time for Gintoki v Nizou on the rooftop. I bet all of the budget went here. Lets do this.

Oh yeah, Katsura used to sport explosives. What happened with that?

That drunken sword technique and bullet catching

The blind man blinded by the intensity of the Silver Soul

[Kagura aims low like a certain delusional girl I know of](http://i.imgur.com/WEt7Vbb.gif)	

Forgot the whole conflict between the swordsmiths about the objectives, applications, and art of their craft. Not Sorachis best work, but it was nicely woven into the story.

Dang, the conversation between Takasugi and Katsura about drifting apart cuts so much deeper this go around

NOW I know why I didnt remember Bansai until after the Crisis Arc. He barely did anything during Benizakura!

Thank you Monogatari for giving me context for the haircut-heartbroken joke

Alright, this song and fight scene are pretty god damn hype

Lol Elizabeth parachute

And Benizakura sinks to the floor of the sea

More Abuto and Kamui fanservice before things come to a close

I dont know if I can handle a Shinsengumi movie where Mitsuba acts as a central pillar

Oh boy, every shunned character is piling into the Odd Jobs office. Geeze, even the "Make your own Amanto" girl squeezed in there.

Lost it at the Warner Brothers appearance. That gag made the whole movie for me.

*****

Having spent 200 more episodes with everyone, Benizakura *does* feel noticeably different with a second viewing in its theatrical form. I wouldnt rank this arc amongst the best of the shows material, and I didnt find the movie to be as "enhanced" as I thought it would be, but I found the experience interesting enough to warrant the recommending of this order to others in the future. 
	
###Time To Dick

Let me know if youd like to contribute to backlog and Ill block off some episodes for you.

> Lost it at the Warner Brothers appearance. That gag made the whole movie for me.

IMO literally only reason to watch the film.  I wouldn't say the movie is bad, but it's entirely superfluous.  It's just a re-telling, sometimes frame-for-frame, of what the show did.  And IMO, the show did it better.  The film cut out a lot of side conversations and context to make everything fit into the film.  If you want to see the same fights but reanimated so that they're a little  more fluid and bad ass, that's cool too, but that's not really the reason why I watch Gintama to begin with.  Yorozuya Forever was a waaaay better film.

This makes me kind of sad about how in most of the future arcs Shinpachi doesn't get much screen time where he's not fulfilling his role as the straight guy.

> Kagura aims low like a certain delusional girl I know of

My memory must be terrible since I don't remember when this happened...

> "Make your own Amanto" girl 

If I recall that was a real competition right?

> "enhanced" 

I think I came in with the wrong expectations. But to be honest I'm not sure what I was really expecting out of this movie. I was thinking that they'd add more notable scenes instead of a few cameos and some funny scenes at the start and end of the movie. Not saying that their bad or anything, in fact they were what kept me not confusing it from the original arc.
>> ARTICLE
> My memory must be terrible since I don't remember when this happened...

Reverse image search says Ren Episode 6. IIRC the field trip episode.

> If I recall that was a real competition right?

I believe so. My memory of early episodes is a bit foggy though I have been watching them again for the Time to Dick thing.

Yeah, I feel the same way. Not a production that blew me away, but bringing in 200 extra episodes of context as a viewer definitely made it a different experience.
>> ARTICLE
> but bringing in 200 extra episodes of context

Like you said the relationship between Takasugi to Katsura & Gin and their "paths diverged" made a lot more sense now that we have more knowledge than we did 200 episodes ago.

Other than the start and end of the movie I only noticed 2-3 new scenes. 2 of which were showing Kamui off and the 3rd was a small modification to what I call the "Banjiya Blues scene". 

> Soundtrack

How could I *not* notice that song? That was awesome!
>> ARTICLE
I find it interesting that this movie got a dub, but given how theres almost no jokes in this arc it makes sense. I would happily watch a movie consisting on nothing but meta conversations. 

Onto the actual movie now! And we start off with the same scene from the [9th ending song.](https://vimeo.com/61853116) Shouyou lecture hype! Well there goes Katsura for the majority of the arc (again). Of course this version is nicer looking. Today I remembered (or possibly learned) that Kiheitai meant Demon Army. I certainly dont remember them mentioning the Popularity poll, well played show. Have they always had a phone? Tetsuko! One thing Ive noticed so far is the lack of background music, it helps set the more serious mood that this arc has. I like this new scene with Kamui. [Hardass Eli is best Eli.](http://i.imgur.com/eB6zhA0.png) Reading the [discussion thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2dq3qf/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_5661/) for this arc is quite interesting. It was around 6 months that I watched this so I almost forget what I was thinking/feeling other than Wait, this is actually a serious arc? 

For the first real fight this was really well done. I feel it pales in comparison to some of the later ones however but that is a rather unfair judgement to make. And theres Gins incapacitating wound that I remember quite well. I remember the scene that followed in the following episode and how it had one of my [favourite tracks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGkzRsZvRrw) [So this is how Shinpachi gets his knack for slicing arms off.](http://i.imgur.com/vFG3hdF.png) Takasugi! I still wonder he landed up being 4th on the popularity poll. Shouyou lecture part 2! 

Why dont they just restrain Kaguras legs like they did her arms?  [This scene got slightly modified if I recall correctly.](http://i.imgur.com/fy3HoYr.png) I never realised how much screen time Shinpachi got in this arc before nor do I remember Nizou using a flying robotic horse before when destroying that ship. Speak of the devil Katsura is back (again)! Is this the only time we ever get to see Katsura in a serious arc? I feel like it is but I may be wrong. [I just had to get a picture of this.](http://i.imgur.com/mpt4U1P.png) Anyway onto the real fight which has some really nice choreography to make up for the lack of destruction or movement going on. Again with Shimura Ken. At this point there isnt really much to say unless I started commenting like Id never seen this before. This wont really be an issue in the next movie since its a completely new plot. Lecture mode increment from Tetsukos father! 

> When did our paths become so different?

This line stuck with me when I first watched this arc. Whenever I thought of Takasugi I was always reminded of this line and left wanting to know more about Katsura, Gin & Takasugis backstory ^^Hint ^^Hint. [Hey look, actual Amanto!](http://i.imgur.com/2eN5YId.png) I had to look up when Gin first fought the Harusame to refresh my memory, it was [episode 13]( http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_13) [Cue the fighting music!](http://i.imgur.com/U9Fgj5O.png) I like this new song that they picked for the final fight. Not to mention the animation for it looks amazing. Foreshadowing Kamui again, I like it.

I know this Shinsengumi movie isnt real but I would watch it if it did happen. Ending the movie how we started it, filled with meta conversations. This particular conversation reminds me of [episode 50]( http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_50) where we such great ideas as Madao: Road of Gintama or DragoBleaPeace. [This entire scene is pretty much what I expected.](http://i.imgur.com/PMJ4vFu.png) [Taking meta to a whole new level.](http://i.imgur.com/5WjvMwL.png)
Well that was an enjoyable 1hr and 30 minutes of time spent even though Id already seen this arc before it has been so long since I first saw it and the addition of these new scenes kept things fresh. I look forward to the next movie which as Eli pointed out right at the end is something Ive never seen before.

I must now admit that I wasnt sure what to really say about this arc but I wrote something up anyway.

>> ARTICLE
> I would happily watch a movie consisting on nothing but meta conversations.

No kidding, that sounds fantastic.

> Reading the discussion thread for this arc is quite interesting.

Heh, reading my own comments I don't think my opinion of this arc changed all that much, I kinda found it boring. I did end up liking the other serious arcs that came later though.

> Speak of the devil Katsura is back (again)! Is this the only time we ever get to see Katsura in a serious arc?

Pretty much. Depends on what you consider the Kintama arc, but even then he doesn't have a major role in it. He does call back to this arc from that one though, which I was reminded of.

> Whenever I thought of Takasugi I was always reminded of this line and left wanting to know more about Katsura, Gin & Takasugis backstory ^(Hint Hint.)

Heh, I said something similar. Who knows if it'll ever happen?

This arc made it a staple to the serious arc formula. Bonus points if he gets thrown off into the sea from the pier.

> This scene got slightly modified if I recall correctly.

I may be wrong but I remember Otae passing him in the street

Pretty much "Gintoki.png". Very nice.

His voice is just as great as Hijikata's. I just hope we get to hear more of his voice.

That's exactly how I remember it. They walk past each other then Otae turns around and watches Gin go.

Holy shit, next week's OP and ED have both of my fave artists from the anime.

Is this the real life?
>> ARTICLE
So last night, at around 1 AM my time, I sat down to record myself watching the movie. And I rambled a bit. And then I uploaded it to Youtube and it was immediately muted by a copyright claim from Sony Music. I don't currently have the time or experience to quickly edit the thing so it won't get caught by the automatic filter, so no video for you.

It's now closing in on 3 AM as I'm writing this and I'm not sure what I have to say.It's been so long since first watching the arc that Idon't know what's new to it. I do love the beginning with them showing the WB opening *three times* before they finally get to the story proper. You know what would make it even better, though? The Animaniacs.

The ending bit with all of the different suggestions for the second movie was also hilarious (again; I remember one episode did something similar but I can't remember which one). I would totally watch a Kyubei and Otae movie though.

Being honest: I'm not a fan of Takasugi as a villain. Can't put my finger on why.You know what could possibly help with that? Another movie about his and Gin's background. ^(Hint hint.)

Nizou's not terrible but it's split between him, Takasugi, and the rest of the Kiheitai. That includes Bansai, who I don't think had much of a role in the original arc? He still doesn't here, but I feel like he got a lot more screen time and I like it.Similarly, I like the cameos by Kamui and Abuto who I'm certain weren't in the first time.

I recall I originally said I wasn't watching it for the fights. That's still true, and a number of the fights in the movie were still just not entertaining for me. I'm not sure if it's the story, the animation, or what, but it doesn't do much for me compared to later arcs.

I know I rambled about more in the video, but I'm not going to try to pull out every relevant comment. That's mostly because I'm really tired and not willing to watch myself talk for another hour and a half right now.
>> ARTICLE
> You know what would make it even better, though? The Animaniacs.

[](#what)

Yeah, you definitely wrote this too late at night. Sorry that the YouTube filter caught your video. And yeah, I find myself agreeing with your points. I may have a bit more of an understanding if not empathy for Takasugi's I Simply Destroy Until the Beast Stops Howling tick though, what with the Shoyo and "diverging paths from the same beginning" rhetoric hitting home for me a bit better the second time around.
>> ARTICLE
I would have watched it earlier and come up with better comments but the Spice and Wolf rewatch has been consuming me (being one of two shows still ahead of Gintama in my favorites).

It's annoying that 90 seconds of music ended up muting my entire 90 minutes of talking, but it is what it is.

I did get the diverging paths part this time around, but I still don't quite understand Takasugi's reasoning, if there is any.
>> ARTICLE
Understandable. By all means, spread the gospel of Holo and Lawrence.

My read from the movie was that his hostility toward the shogunate and Edo as a whole was rooted in Shoyo's death as a foothold in attaining the "peace" that Edo has for the time being. You could make an argument, especially after Courtesan of a Nation, that he's just out to exact revenge on those he deems responsible and rebuild Edo as he sees fit. Still, his talk on destruction and recruitment of other major figures in the story do lead you to think that he's after something bigger. Or maybe undoing as much of the world that took the man he valued the most as it is now is the only way he can cope. It's definitely up for discussion and something I hope gets explored later on.
>> ARTICLE

> but I feel like he got a lot more screen time and I like it.

I'm fairly sure that the scene where he was meeting with the Harusame with Kamui watching over never happened before but that is all I remember.

> to watch myself talk

I'd hate to watch myself speak about nonsense. I'd just cringe in embarrassment listening to my own voice.

>Is the anime or manga better in terms of story?

I think the voice acting, sound effects, animation and soundtrack all push Gintama into a new level of awesome.   And I love whenever they play around with OPs and EDs, have all that anime production talk and stuff, Gintama shines the most in its anime form.

>Is Gintama better suited for serious arcs or comedy?

Comedy, while the serious stuff is great, the comedy was what made it special for me.  
But the serious arcs are still an important and great part of Gintama and I'd never want it to go away.

>Also, how do you feel about Gintama': Enchousen?

Business as usual, my favorite arcs were in previous seasons, but this part was still great.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, loved the animation staff talk too XD  Speaking of favourite arcs, which was your favourite ? Was it a comedy arc? I loved the Courtesan of a Nation arc so I wanna know which arc , in your opinion, is better than it.
>> ARTICLE
Four Devas is probably my favorite. If I had to choose my favorite comedy arc, then the Character Poll.
>> ARTICLE
i dont know about the manga cause i never read it but what i enjoy in the serious arcs of gintama is the pacing, its never slow or fast its just the right pacing, seeing that all the arcs are short, its easier to execute than most shounen arcs, i mean the chimera ant arc is quite good but holy shit i kinda feel you could have cut out almost 10 episodes from the arc
>> ARTICLE
I remember i put Hunter X Hunter on hold because of those 11ish episodes during the Palace Invasion with horrible pacing.
>> ARTICLE
i put it on hold when they were still in the forest

I see :) But, was there a chimera ant arc? I don't remember watching it.
>> ARTICLE
That's from  Hunter x Hunter.

>> ARTICLE
Another story arc that I would mention that could've used some trimming, is the current One Piece arc.. 

And having watched Gintama, One Piece (and One-Punch Man) simultaneously/interchangeably, it's become really difficult to continue to watch One Piece. 

Because Gintama only uses 4-5 episodes per 'serious arc', setting up the bad guy, the victim and backstory for both is usually done in a few minutes so it's not dragged out too much, if at all. And then there's One Piece that feels like using 3 episodes for the backstory to a henchman to a henchman to the bad guy or two episodes that are flashbacks within flashbacks..
>> ARTICLE
Don't even get me started on that. Fucking Naruto has the same problem.
>> ARTICLE
at least One Piece doesn't shove ten fucking thousand fillers into you.
>> ARTICLE
True
>> ARTICLE
how i watch one piece right now is wait like a month and then watch all 4 episodes, i just cant take it, i mean luffy was getting beaten up by bellamy for like 10 episodes...
i know that other characters were also fighting but come on...
>> ARTICLE
I have a question about where to even start with Gintama, I saw that there was a 200+ episode season or whatever originally and now there is a new one. My question is, is the new one a reboot, or is it a sequel to the original anime; and if it is even worth watching at this point and if I'd be better off just reading?
>> ARTICLE
The new gintama airing this year is a sequel to the previous airings. Gintama , Gintama', Gintama': Enchousen is the order of the airings. Whether you should read or watch, is the question/ purpose of this post. People have different views on it so 
>> ARTICLE
Sequel series, and the anime adds another level to the comedy between the voice acting and a number of jokes that presumably wouldn't work in the manga (poking fun at their studio, time slot on the air, etc.).
>> ARTICLE
I get very intimidated by long running series, which was the main reason I asked about potentially just reading it. 
>> ARTICLE
Given how many 'rants' and rambling goes on in the series, I would say the manga is more intimidating to read because of the sheer columns of words. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch order: Gintama (201 eps), Gintama' (51 eps), Gintama': Enchousen (13 eps), Gintama Movie 2, Gintama (currently running)

There are also some OVAs which are all stand-alone comedy episodes so you can pretty much watch them whevever. And Gintama Movie 1 is a revised version of a story arc from early in the 1st season you could technically watch it at any point after seeing the arc it re-adapts, but it's not essential.

The manga is great but the anime makes the comedy even funnier and the action episodes even more awesome, plus it adds in a lot more extra comedic segments. The music and voice actors are terrific too. So I'd reccomend the anime all the way. Just keep in mind that the show starts off a little slowly since it takes its time introducing all the side characters before it really gets the ball rolling on being amazing (its the kind of show that keeps getting better and better as it goes). also the 1st two episodes of the original season are anime-only episodes intended to introduce the new show, so if you wanted you could start at episode 3 and not have any problems.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama (201 eps) > Gintama'  > Gintama (2015 ongoing)
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget Enchousen in between Gintama' and the 2015 series, if you're going by MAL.

And also the movie.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama wouldn't be Gintama without both.  Gintama is unique in its ability to seamlessly transition from comedy to seriousness without it seeming completely hamfisted or out of place.  Also I feel that Gintama with it's excellent voice cast and audio crew absolutely shines brightest in animated format. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I see your point. The voice actors in gintama are pretty damn famous for their numerous roles ,for eg Ishida Akira, Kugimiya Rie, etc
>> ARTICLE
> Is the anime or manga better in terms of story?

Both share the same story, but the anime pushes it to a next level. Voicecasting, animation, sound and just the general production quality of Gintama is fantastic and makes the great manga so much better.

>  Is Gintama better suited for serious arcs or comedy?

Preference, some like the serious arcs more, some prefer the comedy. I like a mix of both.

> Also, how do you feel about Gintama': Enchousen?

Loved Enchousen, the Courtesan of a Nation arc remains as one of my favorite Gintama arcs and the opening was just pure awesomeness.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I see. I also agree that a mix of both serious arcs and comedy is the best. Though, Enchousen appealed less to me compared to the previous airings, as I felt that the comedy outclassed it. Nevertheless, Courtesan of a Nation is still one of the my best arcs. Thanks for your opinion :D
>> ARTICLE
As I said, it's preference. I think the comedy from 266-299 was weaker than the previous seasons due to the director change and I am glad that the we are getting the Shogun Assassination arc now.
>> ARTICLE
I like the comedy arcs much more, it suits the style of the show so well. People rag one the first 50 episodes of Gintama but i loved them because they are short simple funny arcs.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, then if you compare the first 50 episodes of the original series (2006) to the first 30 of the current airing, which shines better in the comedy factor? 
>> ARTICLE
Im still watching it and am currently in the 100's. I have yet to see the 2015 eps
>> ARTICLE
To answer your first question, i'd say the manga is the best. In the transfer to the anime medium, always little details get left out (like Abuto's cunning line towards Zenzou showing his intelligence, which was left out of last episode).

It does both very well, with the SA arc in my opinion being the best thing Gintama has done. However overall i prefer the comedy arcs over the serious ones.

Gintama: Enchousen was awesome. It had 3 amazing arcs in a row (Kintama, Courtesan of a Nation and Beam Saber arc).
>> ARTICLE
I see. I have never actually read the manga, so I don't know the subtle differences between it and the anime. I heard many people say that the story organisation of the anime differs greatly from the manga, so I was wondering which was better. 
>> ARTICLE
I like them both to be honest. The fight scenes in Gintama's serious arcs are amazing (Gin vs. Jirocho comes to mind). But the comedy is what causes gintama to have a special place in my heart. 
>> ARTICLE
I prefer the comedy stuff. The serious arcs are nothing better than any other shonen. Avarage at best. 
>> ARTICLE
Enchousen seems like it's getting different treatment compared to other seasons why is that? I recently cought up to Gintama, so I don't know much.
>> ARTICLE
Enchousen mainly consists of three back-to-back serious arcs with not much of a connection compared to the previous airings. I feel that the comedy factor outclassed it. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah. I loved Enchousen, but I can see why people have problem with it.
>> ARTICLE
The anime is better because it's like they 2.5D'd the manga. 

I think the serious arcs wouldn't be good if not for the hundreds of comedy episodes. We get to know the characters so well before they start fighting that it only hits harder. 
>> ARTICLE
I see where you're coming from. 
>> ARTICLE
Good question


>Is the anime or manga better in terms of story?


Both fantastic. But I think story wise the manga shines brighter than the anime. However, the anime has music and actual animation, so I would give it a lot of credit for bringing those stories to life.


>Is Gintama better suited for serious arcs or comedy?



If we have to go by either or then pure comedy is better than pure seriousness. But I think Gintama anime/manga shines the most when it mixes the 2 things.

>> ARTICLE
I like the comedy more, and the serious arcs are generally pretty average. I however love Yoshiwara in flames and the spider arc, 4 Devas and the ones in Enchousen

Kintama kind of held the other brilliant arcs in there down though
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I see. 
>> ARTICLE
Despite it being episodic, some arcs are extremely good, whilst some others seem to be a bit rushed or boring. However don't let that put you off if any of you haven't watched Gintama, it's an amazing anime. It's got so many references to other manga/anime and also famous or iconic people which are recognised in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
I love Gintama but it seems like people in this sub are over-recommending it.

Man, untill I saw this post, I really thought I was in the Gintama sub. But I do love Gintama too, too bad they're not making more anime right now!

Nah, it's all good, plus this and HxH this seems to be the only widely recommended long running shounen on here.

You shush. When I first joined reddit, no one ever talked about Gintama. My comments about it were ignored. No one seemed to recognize it's existence. 

Now there are multiple Gintama-related posts every day and there's at least one reference in every thread.

This means too much to me! I won't let you take away the Gintama Shangri-La I've waited so long for!

I always just got putt off but how extremely blunt the comedy is. I know Japan has a pretty peculiar sense of humor and really try to hammer their jokes in, but Gintama just takes things too far and instead of delivering the jokes just throw them full force at the screen.

Just skip the first 2 episodes and give the next 5 episodes a chance to see if you like it or not. It's a little slow at start but one of the funniest shows there is.

Gintama is such a bittersweet show for me.

I originally got into the show expecting a long term plot because there was some serious moments with actually serious flashbacks.

It took me 100 episodes before I realized "These guys have no intention to advance the plot and are fucking with everyone."
>> ARTICLE
Uhh, what plot?
>> ARTICLE
There actually is a very serious plot in Gintama but it progresses at a snail's pace.  It starts when Kagura shows up, then her father, then progresses at the Hosen Arc, and finally the three devas arc (with some minor progression spread throughout the series).  I am probably missing an arc in there somewhere too.

Honestly, it's an amazing story and I really wish we could see the ONE fight they've been building up to FOREVER.  Since they do such a great job with Gintoki's battles I think that one in particular will be epic.

If you watch the show you'll know which fight I am referring to.  Let's just say it is first hinted at in the Hosen arc.
>> ARTICLE
Are you reading the manga?

[Spoiler](/s "I'm at the part with Hanzo D: Nuooo Sho-chan!!!")

Yeah, I know. I was only joking. I haven't finished the series yet, but I've already gathered that the whole Yato clan thing and Gin's friends from the war (Katsura, Taksugi) were important. They're all reoccurring characters that appear in important arcs, so I ventured a guess.

It's kind of hard to remember that it has such a fantastic overarching plot, though, what with all of the equally fantastic non-related arcs and one off joke episodes. I can't wait to see more of it, and although I'm not even at the end, I hope they continue the series at some point.

Don't spoil anything, though. I'm in the middle of episode 170!

Did you watch it week-to-week or all at once when the episodes were already released? 
>> ARTICLE
All at once, like every anime I watch :p
>> ARTICLE
Yeah.. That would be why thinking about it doesn't turn you into a rage monster. If I remember correctly they weren't prereleasing episode titles at the time so we had no idea how long it would go for. We all eagerly awaited the second season only to get shit on by the show runners. Wasting 2/3rds of the season on a single story meant they covered virtually no content from the other books.
>> ARTICLE
Endless eight was actually an amazing bit of immersion.

I mean, you were watching eight episodes of Yuki slowly descend into absolute helpless despair out of frustration and pure boredom from seeing the same events transpire over and over in similar ways. 

Meanwhile, everyone was getting upset over the frustration and boredom of seeing the same events transpire over and over in similar ways.

I enjoyed that.
>> ARTICLE
In hindsight, you are completely right. But god damnit they could of covered the endless 8 story in 3 episodes and had an extra 5 episodes of content from the light novels! I'M SO CONFLICTED!!

Well that explains it...

did they really air endless 8 week after week?  i thought they did like 2 episode chunks cause thatd be shitty

Naruto defined a generation of anime fans. It's gone on longer than I personally feel it should have but I can say the same thing for One Piece, Bleach, and Dragonball. 

There's a reason why these series' are so highly praised they are some of the best at what they do. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, okay.
>> ARTICLE
One piece honestly just gets better and better, though. I'll have to disagree with you on that. But Bleach steadily went downhill. There were multiple points where I thought the series would have been better off ending.
>> ARTICLE
I just loose interest when shows get that long. I was following Naruto, Bleach and One Piece from the start but eventually I just couldn't stay interested.

Dragon Ball/Z is safe because I have major nostalgia goggles for it but honestly if it came out now I would probably get bored of it too.
>> ARTICLE
Kai is good, but Kai Buu Saga is dragging and I can't fathom how slow the original Buu Saga was.  And of course there's always Abridged, and if you get bored of that I don't know what to tell ya.
>> ARTICLE
I still like DBZ out of nostalgia because it finished before the period of time when long shows started bothering me.

I think it started to happen as I grew up and had less time on my hands... Suddenly waiting 500 episodes to see the conclusion of the show didn't appeal to me lol.

There are other things I like that I normally wouldn't like if introduced to them now but still do like thanks to nostalgia. One such example is Pokemon, I still play the games to this day because of nostalgia.

I just started Gintama and spoiled myself already. I really should keep away from titles with Gintama in it. With that said: this looks fucking great.

Gintama isn't the type of anime where spoilers will affect your enjoyment of it that much, if at all. 80% of the show is just comedy. That said it is still the greatest creation in the history of the universe.

Nah don't worry about it this hardly counts as a spoiler


It's actually pretty hard to spoil Gintama since a lot of the arcs don't relate to each other and you know, there is no real plot

It seems like there are no brakes on the Gintama hype train, although it's been a while since the last season aired. 

I remember a year or two ago when it wasn't even among the top 200 most popular anime on MAL, now it's #72 in popularity.

I remember looking at Gintama back when it came to America via Shonen Jump. I read the preview issue and figured I would wait a while before getting into it so some more stuff could some out (didn't really know about internet manga/anime at the time) but then I forgot about it.

I should probably get on that...

Sket dance is actually super funny too. They even do a cross over with gintama

Actually, Sket Dance's creator worked as an assistant of Sorachi Hideaki. 
>> ARTICLE
Just finished watching that episode. They start out talking about the shared voice actors between the series, then jump into a completely blatant ripoff of the Toriko x One Piece crossover from earlier in that year.  A few things happened, and both the main characters had their dicks turned into hammers.

Good episode. Would recommend.

I love the hardboiled saxophone riff as soon as the hammers drop out

Gintoki and Switch refer to themselves as Sugita for the rest of that episode if I remember

Aaah these videos are funny as hell but I started watching episode 2 and it's sooo damn boooriiing ._. I don't know if it's worth the endure through those first boring episodes.

Don't worry, man.

You just need to find a t-t-t-t-t-time machine and go to the future when you've already seen all the character-establishing episodes.

Yes. It absolutely fucking is.

When I rewatch Gintama (which I do fairly regularly.. I've seen it at least 15 times now), I usually start at like episode 4-5ish. The first few are kinda bland.


But goddamn, if it isn't worth it. So fucking funny.

So Gintama basically had a year's worth of reruns in the year between episodes 201 and 202. These reruns had their own OP/ED, but we will never see them part of this watch group. 

Here are my two favorite missed EDs: [The pretty one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlK_WEQoeg) and [the random one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWUqK8xsnH0)

>> ARTICLE
Meh, the videos got deleted, do you mind uploading them again?
Maybe even a link to them all, I really would like to watch them, since Gintama has awesome OP/Eds
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I love the art style of the first one, not to mention the song itself is pretty good. It reminds me of Katanagatari. The random one has a neat reggae feel to it with as you said randomness. Its a real shame we won't get that first one though. That would easily be my favourite looking ED.

Yeah I remembered I forgot to mention that last week. Thanks for reminding I'll post the ED/OP's with videos next week so everyone can see them

Greatly late in the party, but I'm a first time watcher too! I've been following this rewatch group from the start, instantly fell in love with Gintama and never fell behind (actually I'm always a couple of episodes in front). Based onurtag needs a mention too for creating this! I salute you!
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching Gintama for years now. I'm just replying here to say that all the other first-timers are bringing a tear to my eye. I used to proselytize Gintama like it was my job, but all I ever got was "it's so long, though" and "there are too many references I don't get."

Seeing how far it's come, and how much other people are recommending and explaining it... I'm just so happy this show is getting the love and recognition it deserves in the states. Thank you, based Onurtag.

Another first time watcher here, I was watching since the start of these threads, but I fell behind when the amount of eps grew to ~6 per week and I just recently caught up. 

I don't talk much in the threads because I'm more of a lurker, but this series is slowly becoming one of my favourites. I'm glad I started watching Gintama with this group, I wouldn't start watching it otherwise.

First timer here, I think I've been around since blessed Onurtag first started this group. It's been on my list for ages and ain't nobody got time for 200 episodes, gave me the push to start. 

And bless them for it, three cheers for Onurtag!

>> ARTICLE
**Ep. 200** - A Christmas episode, eh? My parents just always asked me to make a list of things I wanted, worked most of the time. Apparently when it first aired it was even further away from Christmas than we are now!

A full head of hair *as always*? I seem to recall an episode where you ended up with two bald spots where your buns normally go, young lady. "See the beginning of this episode for details?" I hope she included a DVD at least. Also that looked like R2D2 pushing a trash bin in the office.

I don't remember if this style of ship showed up before, but it just occurred to me that it's ridiculous to have a spaceship with masts and sails like that. Aww, Umibouzu's coming to town!

Bit heavy with the false cheer there, Shinpachi. Umibouzu's playing Santa, eh? Oh crud, so is Gintoki. He has the more impressive beard though. Neither of them wants to back down, maybe time for a Santa-off? Now they're convinced the other one could be the real Santa because they apparently don't remember each other from that earlier arc. One of the other places looked to be the moon with a giant monolith on it.

This is going to get bloody, looks like. And then ~~Kyubei~~ Kyuta Claus also intervenes, followed by ~~Kondo~~ Monkey Claus. Time for it to be ridiculous instead! Sacchan isn't even trying.

It's a contest! Wait, why are you putting clothes on, Sacchan?

---
**Ep. 201** - ...did they just fast-forward through the OP? I was watching that! And Shinpachi gets to play a tree now. Where did Otae get the meat pie from? She definitely couldn't make one herself.

Texas? I'm glad this is just roleplaying, I don't think many parts of Texas would have snow on pine trees like that. Ew, that meat pie after five years. Aww, cute little Sadaharu doll. And an Elizabeth one too! No comment on Kondo's performance in that scenario.

Kyubei's turn: now Kagura's an orphan? What's a pachi girl anyway? I love that Otae's playing all the passersby. Okay, not an orphan but home life sucks. Apparently a pachi is a miraculous punching bag. Kyubei buys into it a bit too much. Love the scoring system.

Shinpachi has a normal scenario, but of course Sacchan's just going to ruin it. Spectacled ninja Santa robot? I'll take ten if they all look like her. Giant Kagura nonchalantly looking in on them with the sudden shift to her story.

Now they're all transfer students! At least they aren't giving up. Suddenly Hasegawa-roach is also in the running and for some reason Kagura's falling in love with him. And so is Otae? This story has gone way off the rails and Shinpachi has wisely abandoned ship long ago.

So this has somehow turned into a competition for a cockroach's heart between Kagura and Otae. And then they decide to start going out instead? This almost takes over for most outrageous episode, just needs more fourth wall breaking.

Aww, credit roll for the season, and at the time, the end of the series. I can't imagine what it would feel like to reach that ending after four years of following the show every week.

---
**Ep. 202** - Shinpachi has a good point about explaining the show to newcomers, but Kagura has a better one about no one really paying attention. Also I like that they actually make the transition to widescreen at the beginning there.

New opening! Not sure how I feel about this one yet, as usual. New villains at the end too, I see. It's... kinda weird to see the show in widescreen now. Dragonball Gin, eh? And Kagura's taking after her father at least for a little bit.

Sadaharu... shrunk? Wait, no, that's the delivery man. Sadaharu sounds a bit like Kyubei (but oddly enough it's Otsu's voice actress, according to MAL). There's a tiny Sadaharu at the end of his tail? It's a wart? So weird. Going down to Otose's, I figure they're also going to be radically different if they're hiding their faces like that. Yep, more warts.

At least Otae's the same as far as I can tell. I'm still wondering what her attitude toward Gintoki is, she has an interesting look on her face when talking about him there. Wait, Kondo's... part of the family? If I was Shinpachi I'd probably start bleeding from my eyes too.

Well, her cooking hasn't improved so at least *something* is the same in this world. And Shinpachi's in the Shinsengumi now! *Three* of the--oh. I love Shinpachi running away past everything; I remember seeing a gif of that a while ago.

Holy shit, Kyubei's accepted being girly and wow, she's hitting on him. Girly Kyubei x Shinpachi new OTP? Love that imagery of Shinpachi reaching out to her... except she had surgery down there and basically flipped her identity. Writers, you trolled me hard on that one. Well done.

> This is so crazy that I have no idea what's going on anymore!

Me neither, Shinpachi. Katsura's now paranoid about Kyubei taking over his role as someone mentioned after the Popularity Poll arc. Come on, that was a perfect opportunity for "Katsura ja nai, Zurako da!" there.

Not really impressed with the ending so far, will have to see if it grows on me. I have to wonder what fans of the show thought when this episode came in after a long year of waiting. I'm glad the staff didn't lose their stride and this ranks among my favorite episodes as a result.

---
**Ep. 203** - Yamazaki's gone blonde and crazy for anpan, while Hijikata's a total pushover? With Kondo out of the way, that leaves an open path for Sougo to take over and I like his style. I noticed the "de Sade" snuck into his name which is a fun reference to the Marquis de Sade, whom we get the words sadism/sadist from. Nice job with the Jerkaiser title (Bakaiser in Japanese is also funny).

So Hijikata's also the straight man in this one, nice. If the warts thrive on ambition, I'm a little confused as to why Gin's been affected at all. I'm not going to try to explain my thought process as all the babies showed up, it was just an escalating series of WTFs.

It turns out Gin *wasn't* affected and Shinpachi was? I think I missed something there, but oh well everyone's back to normal (I hope) after that.

---
**Ep. 204.0** - Whee out of place holiday episodes. Those look like real photographs, are they staff members and their families? Love the cards from the villains of the series. 

Of course Katsura was on standby for the Santa episode. Sacchan sending out fake wedding photos? To everyone apparently. I like her ambition, but Tsukuyo is not amused. Kondo had his own fake photos with Otae and... baby Shinpachi? Not even trying with that one. Kyubei is not impressed with those developments either. She and Tsukuyo need to woman up and take them out.

And Yamazaki seems to have gone crazy after the wart thing. So Sacchan and Kondo have gone missing?  Hasegawa too... and he's lost his memory and somehow ended up in a weird tribal area. The other two behind the masks are obviously Sacchan and Kondo, and that got weird. Happy New Year!??

---
**Ep. 204.5** - Valentine's Day! Aww, Kagura wants to get chocolates for Gin and Shinpachi. Tsukuyo is fantastic in this one, love her tsundereness. One of the chocolates had alcohol in it, uh oh. Time for her to abuse Gin!

I like Sacchan's plan, chocolate covered tsun/yandere for everyone! It's fun seeing her and Tsukuyo interact, and the three of them covered in chocolate at the end is cute. Otae too! Four best girls (aside from Kyubei).

---
**Ep. 205.0** - Anpan: the series. Yamazaki has gone off the deep end over the last three episodes. I like his throwing stance pasted over different backgrounds.

> Anpanning the anpan to anpan the anpan and anpanny anpan, anpan, anpan...

---
**Ep. 205.5** - Kondo gets a break! Kind of. I'm also pretty sure that means Otae never wants to see him again after that.

I know it's been used as a phrase in the show before, but it's *literally* raining spears this time. And then a ton of other awful things happen to him.

> Some invisible, evil force is actively interfering with my love!

The universe hates you, Kondo. Get used to it. The poor girl with her brother and father, all reunited again only to have a meteorite come to strike them down. Kondo stepping up to bat reminds me of [this comic](http://www.kiwisbybeat.com/minus37.html). A swing and... not quite. Love Otae's blank look as it hits her.

---
**Ep. 206** - Grown ups with the name change, but you still say it the same way. Wonder what they'll do for Enchousen or whatever the next series name is. Catherine... found a boyfriend? Good for her! And he's wealthy. 

They say love makes a girl more beautiful, so my first thought is she's going to be uglier than before but Catherine and her beau love her look. My second thought is that she actually turns out to be really cute now, and that's the route they went. And they're engaged!

Dude lost his money? Now Otose's skeptical and I'm inclined to agree with her. You don't argue with the wisdom of someone like her. That bottle had to hurt, but at least it's a nice parting gift. I like that Catherine's face gets twisted again when she's angry at Otose.

Aaaand it turns out Otose was right. The company isn't even trying to hide that it's evil, it's right there in the name. Gin's been on the case the entire episode though, time for a beat down. 

So the bottle of wine she gave to Catherine is actually really expensive? This is why Otose is one of my favorite characters. Her coming to visit Catherine at her "bar" is also fantastic.

---
For having a year off, the show didn't drop a beat and I'm glad to see it's just as good as before. And now they can't make any more jokes about not being widescreen.

>> ARTICLE
> Kyubei's turn: now Kagura's an orphan? What's a pachi girl anyway? I love that Otae's playing all the passersby. Okay, not an orphan but home life sucks. Apparently a pachi is a miraculous punching bag. Kyubei buys into it a bit too much. Love the scoring system.

Too bad it wasn't the kind of abuse that we wanted ):
>> ARTICLE
Here it is! My first ever write up.

**Episode 200**  Another increment of 25 so Im expecting something silly.
I like this father/daughter dynamic that Gin and Kagura have got going. Normally my parents would just ask me what I wanted. Of course Gin skimps out on the present. Did you actually think he had money to spend? Santa Justaway is best Justaway.

Umibouzu is fighting what looks like turtles wearing boxing gloves?! Umibouzu is coming to town! Just covered in blood but that doesnt matter! Hasegawa, how did you get that cake? That question answered itself 1 second later. Shinpachi trying to lighten the mood and just looking awkward doing so.

Umibouzu going in with the Pretend to be Santa plan. Of course Gins also dressed up, it isnt in his character to drink the night away. I sense a face-off between these two to determine the real santa. Now you realise that youre both fakes? Neither side backing down is to be expected. I fail to see how musical taste is related to the legitimacy of who the real Santa is but Ill roll with it.

Oh and heres the first punch! And Kyubei Kyuta Claus breaks up the fight while wearing a Santa outfit of her own. Unlike the other 2 she actually has a sack of presents and a sword. Im not sure Santa was known for carrying a sword. Kondo Monkey Claus with all the jungle analogies, then Saachan turns up as if on cue. This has turned into a Find the real Santa competition run by Kagura. I can see this being something absurd. Santa test hype! Im a bit surprised that Katsura wasnt taking part in this.
***

**Episode 201** -  I guess they really want to jump straight into things. Youre going to regret going first Kondo Monkey Claus. I dont think that a live person as a Christmas tree is something that is found in every country Kagura. That or Ive been doing it wrong all these years. 

That pie looks too good for it to be Mother Otaes doing. So its set in Texas for some reason. Does it even snow in Texas? Hasegawa likened to a cockroach, if thats the case then whos the father or is there no father? Petnam? Hey its that guy from the test Katsura gave out to join the Anti-Foriegners. Noooo! KIA via meat pies. Normal sized Sadaharu is cute. I was just about to question the condition of that pie after 5 years and it looks like something youd submit for a science project. I want an Elizabeth stuffed toy! In the middle of the woods in Texas, that checks out. I wonder whether that pie was really eaten or just stolen to save whatever unfortunate person might have had to eat it. Using poo to spell out Merry Christmas... well at least its creative. How does this scoring system even work!? 6 is considered a high score? If it was out of 10 then I wouldnt really say that 6 is too high.

Kyubeis turn and it looks like its set in Victorian London or something. Yeah, what is a pachi? Hasegawa once again a cockroach expect this one drinks, these are some scary roaches. Im amazed that Shinpachi is able to keep that pose even when being punched repeatedly. Kagura x Vomit is the OTP. So Santa joins in with the pachi beating. The judges look for the weirdest reasons to score with. 

Saachan is next, I expect that Gin will be in this and maybe some Natto. This time its set in what looks like the framework for a dating sim. I wonder what that sticky stuff is Again with the cockroaches. Clich much? All thats missing is slice of toast in Kaguras mouth. Nice pompadour Umibouzu. Both Gin and Umi are speaking nonsense now fighting over who is going to be the clich transfer student. Hasegawa a teacher? I admit it would be nice to see that. 5 transfer students all in a single classroom. Nope, Hasegawa is doomed to be a cockroach forever and this time his body is that of a cockroach. Kagura crushing on Cockroach Hasegawa. Ive seen weirder things happen. Kagura knitting is kind of adorable.  Uh oh, a love rival! This suddenly got quite serious, I like it as clichd as it is. Gin and Umi finally have a significant role in this little tale, watching over the two of them. Hasegawa admits hes forever a cockroach. Merry last episode huh?  And now we get a montage of the entire season. Quite an enjoyable season if I had to say so myself. 
***

**Episode 202**  Back on the air and looking better than ever in glorious 16:9! Reusing the old introduction I see, Gin has some good leg strength to be able to launch Kagura like that. Now I know where those shit eating smiles came from, new characters shown too. Overall I quite like the new OP, its got a nice sense of vigor. At this point Im just used to Gintama breaking the fourth wall like that. Whoa! What happened to your face Gin? Training for 2 years huh? I get the feeling that this is all a big reference to something and its all whooshing over my head. Kagura seems taller than usual plus uh wow. [Shes looking good](http://i.imgur.com/R2sLv4t.png). Can we keep her? 

Being able to balance perfectly on Shinpachis head like that deserves some merit I feel. Sadaharu hasnt changed much. For a second I thought he/she/it was the one who rang the doorbell. Kyubeis voice? I wow. I was actually kind of right with my earlier guess. Sadaharu got pregnant and grew a micro baby on the end of its tail!? Interesting reproduction method Im so confused now. Dont tell me Otose and co. have changed too? OH GOD THEIR FACES! TAMA NO! WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOUR LOVELY FACE!

Shinpachi not having any of it. Im a little surprised that Otae hadnt changed in some way I take back what I said about Otae. Is this a dream or something? Even after 2 years she still hadnt learned how to cook. Some things never change huh? Now Shinpachi got drafted into the Shinsengumi? Shinpachi casually setting world records with that speed. Kyubeis more feminine! I approve! This must be a dream. I wonder how many Shinpachi x Kyubei fanfics this episode created. 

> Turn into a mad scientist
All this line made me think of was [Steins;Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bf0aYBk0OQ).

That look of disappointment says it all damn it show! Katsura [I mean Zurako appears!](http://i.imgur.com/XhqcaOC.png). New ED is interesting, I found it odd how it was just [Tama & Catherine shown with no Otose however](http://i.imgur.com/wcZ6Um6.png).
***

**Episode 203**  A fight over being the tranny character in the show is an unusual motivation. And heres the Shinsengumi! Ilike how Shinpachi remembered Yamazakis position in the popularity poll. So if Yamazaki is the vice-commander who is the new commander? Yamazaki, what did you do to our glorious Hijikata?! Hes too nice now. NOT THE MAYO!  [Well thats one way of putting it.]( http://i.imgur.com/J7jxfky.png) The Shinsengumi are German now? [This pose]( http://i.imgur.com/DSKLqhk.png) reminds me of Lelouch from Code Geass. Yep even the speech was very Code Geassy. Since when was Gin a Shogun? Thank god Hijikata hadnt changed! Now we see MADAOs story of how he became a singer/songwriter. Being the straight man is really tough apparently. 

Both of them going their separate ways. Wait so this is all caused by a space wart?! Somehow pumping yourself up holding a paper fan just doesnt quite cut it. Kagura going dere is too much for me to handle. What is going on!? Sudden plot developments all over the place! Dont be fooled! [This face](http://i.imgur.com/Py4sBwP.png) will haunt my dreams. Hijikata just lost his right to be the straight man. This is turning into some cliche drama. That is one easy rooftop to reach apparently with all these prams. Shinpachi returning things to the way it should be. Shinpachi is advancing the plot too much here. I knew it! He was also infected and Gin was the only one who wasnt infected. What was with that [blue explosion at the end?]( http://i.imgur.com/PBU76RD.png) 
***

**Episode 204 ** Ok I admit I'm now enjoying the OP quite a lot. Again, this feels weird watching holiday themed episodes a few weeks after said events. Kagura and Shinpachi are not having any of Gins bitching. Superimposing a wedding photo of who I assume would be a staff member.

> Just write that you had a baby after ****ing like rabbits.

This would make for an amusing card.

Are these New Year cards just going to be a subtle way of reminding people about the entire cast? I feel like Ive barely seen Mutsu for most of the series. The Kiheitai getting their card in there. I was hoping that Kamui wouldve sent one. [I KNEW IT!](http://i.imgur.com/weYA8sY.png) Saachan did a good job of superimposing herself at least. Theres Gedomaru again! I hope we see more of her. Awww poor Tsukky. That is one unhappy baby. I never knew I wanted [Otsu with bunny ears](http://i.imgur.com/jVGzkas.png) until now. Kyubeis New Years message is getting a little aggressive I feel. Everyone using New Year cards as missing person inquiries now. Someone better get Yamazaki some Anpan fast! I like Hasegawas new shades but how can he see with them? Even when washed ashore and taken in by a tribe hes still known as Madao and hated by all. Some things never change I guess. Now were getting a backstory of a tribe war in which 1 side is being lead by Kondo and the other side by Saachan. Gins patience has ran out by this point.
[Any idea what this means?](http://i.imgur.com/Lu2xycD.png)

**Episode 204.5 -** Gin really doesnt like Valentines Day huh? To be fair Im on the same boat, just not as extreme. Gin really wants some chocolate. Hey Kagura, who is that heart shaped box that youre hiding meant to be for? Thats a creepy looking Valentines mascot Nice job Gin, youre as smooth as ever. Tsukky just casually stealing Kaguras gift. Hey its the hiccup!!! Embarrassed Tsukky is best Tsukky. I want more tsundere Tsukky. Guess Saachan cant get over being beaten by Justaway. I really like seeing Saachan interacting with Tsukky, I hope this continues in the future. This is too adorable. Gin and Shinpachi really need that chocolate huh?

> [Any idea what this means?](http://i.imgur.com/Lu2xycD.png)

[I had to look it up.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dmaden) So, Ryomaden was a really popular Japanese [Taiga drama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga_drama) that aired during Gintama's off year. Remember how Sakamoto's card said that last year's Taiga drama was about him and the Kihetai mentioned they were in it? Turns out it was a historical series about roughly the same time period that Gintama's based on, which the show could have used to its advantage.

And welcome to the verbose group!

Well I'll be damned. I forgot to mention everyone saying about how they were all in last year's Taiga drama. But yeah, that makes sense.

Thanks for having me! I'll do my best to please you all!

>I get the feeling that this is all a big reference to something and its all whooshing over my head.

Gintoki's whole new backstory and attire are a reference to [Yamcha from Dragonball Z](http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Yamcha). And the whole "[two years training](http://i.imgur.com/kZIGtuH.jpg)" is a reference to One Piece, as the [Sabaody Archipelago](http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Sabaody_Archipelago) is the place where the main characters meet again after spending two years training.

**Episode 205**  So now we get the story of Yamazakis obsession with Anpan huh? That girl who Yamazaki bumps into sounds familiar I have to admit everytime I see the word anpan all I think of is Clannad. Now we get our mayo drenched ramen in higher quality! And this is how Anpanman begins. I wonder what it says about me about how I can relate to going a few days without having any conversation. The descent into Anpan related madness continues. I like how Yamazaki has the exact same throwing stance every time he throws the anpan.

> Anpanning the anpan to anpan the anpan and anpanny anpan, anpan, anpan
MAKE IT STOP! Oh god! Not the mayo-drenched ramen again! REVENGE SPARKING! 
***

**Episode 205.5 ** Wow so Kondo actually landed a date? Penetrate the giant wall? What giant wall? 

> My relentless rain of love has finally spread open her tightly shut legs!
Thats a good metaphor.

I knew thered be a catch to this date. The show really likes talking about raining spears but I think this is the first time that its actually happened. You just have horrible luck Kondo. Fate decided that you should not be happy. That kid (Sachiko) and her brother seems familiar. Kondo REALLY swung that bat hard from the looks of it or not.
***

**Episode 206 ** Ginpachi sensei! Going with the apostrophe for its continuation huh? I wonder what the next season will have an addition to the title. Maybe 2 apostrophes? Catherine has a boyfriend?! Im with you on that one Gin. How many Terabytes are there in Yottabyes I wonder and how much storage space does Tama have for that matter. And now I see where that endless drink GIF came from. Wow, that was fast and Catherine actually looks cute now. Hey eyes in the little flashback remind me a lot of Sawako from Kimi ni Todoke. Lehman Brothers? Im pretty sure Im missing out on something with that. So the guy lost his money and with that I along with Otose get skeptical Times like this are why Tama is my No.2 best girl. Can we keep the lovestruck version of Catherine? Shes more tolerable in this form. Come on Otose, at least you still have Tama with her ungodly amount of storage space.

So Otose was right and Gin is on the case. With a name like Evil 4 Lyfe their not even trying to hide it. Otose visiting Catherine in her bar was too damn good. I really want to see more in the serious parts.
Considering that this was done a year after they are still on the ball with everything. However now they cant make any more widescreen jokes.

One thing that I've already learned is that I need to cut down the word count so that in the future I can fit it all into a single response. Also I still need to figure out how to split each separate episode using lines.

**Management**  my (hopefully) final semester of college is starting next week, so expect these posts to get a bit messier because I am still shit at organizing my time.

Damn that Time Skip album is a thing of beauty.

*****

**Ep. 200**  Tactical Christmas present coercion. Its nice to be at an age where I can text an Amazon URL to family and be done with it. Unless youre dealing with a digital immigrant. Then you have to request articles of clothing. I dont think Gin falls into the latter category though, Kagura.

I love how standoffish the tone is between Kagura and Umibozu in their correspondence. Shinpachi is way too transparent in trying to get Kagura out of [her bummed-out deadpan](http://31.media.tumblr.com/2f75bf4b6a5a00a80d46b4c8a057af0f/tumblr_mxdrkgSBsY1sycuvlo1_500.gif). Shes in need of a father figure and she has two halves of one. Umibozu and Gin facing off whenever he visits seems fitting with that in mind. Didnt expect the Enya reference. Yeah, Gin, you *met* Santa. Dont overthink things or apply DBZ logic. The desperation is palpable. DID KYUUBEI JUST USE KATSURAS CATCHPHRASE?!? Treacherous character confirmed. Kondo Claus has a decent ring to it. Sacchans idea of a present may be a bit misguided. Santa Tag-Team Christmas Death Match hype?

*****

**Ep. 201**  Whoa superfast opening making room for the inevitable AMV. As a Texan, can confirm I eat nothing but meat pie in front of my Buddhist alter while the snow falls heavily outside ^^what ^^is ^^snow? Kagura should keep her hair down occasionally. Kondo pls this is the pleasant Christmas-in-March finale. I dont know about you guys but Ive found a new Christmas tradition in a pachi. Cockroach Hasegawa, why are you even putting up with such abuse? Is it just me or has the show had more vomit as of late? Oh boy, ready yourself Shinpachi. We are now in ecchi light novel adaptation territory. Its sad how Otae has to specify that she and Shinpachi are related by blood. Sweet pompadour, Umibozou. 

> Young girls are suckers for destiny

These are the shows real nuggets of wisdom. Kagura, follow the formula FFS! At least its a love triangle. True santas giving us one final touching ending. [The only sendoff I wanted]( http://i.imgur.com/WtDOaOr.jpg ).

> Happy Merry Last Episode

Oh god its too bittersweet.

> Thank you kindly for four years of support

Its been a pleasure, show. Really.

> See you again someday

Im aware Ill see you tomorrow and an in April after we complete sixth season and movie, but still. I may not have experienced the show had it not been for the watch group. Its been fun interacting with all of you and sharing my silly thoughts and reactions. 

*****

**Ep. 202**  Im giving you all of my attention, Kagura. And dont you forget it. The aspect ratio! Its glorious! 

I will never see enough of the shit-eating grins. Damn, Gintama is back with *vigor*!

[DA. DA. DA.](http://i.imgur.com/48IKAyg.png)

[Durarara!! Ep 12](/s "Shinpachi clearly did not heed Izayas word on evolving in order to escape the mundane.") Ah, I see what they mean by [Sazae Format]( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazaeSan?from=Main.Sazae-san ) [TVTropes warning]. My statement about giving Kagura attention became much truer. Wartiharu I dont even. When did Otae get so nice? Yup, were on the wrong world line guys. Its just one terrible thing after another thrown on Shinpachis head. I feel bad for laughing so much. Whoa, Kyuubei! Might not be so bad of a timeline after all. Might be okay with this strange pairing. Did she just open her legs? Show, what? Show. I know youre excited to be back but there are limits.

..Oh no. No. No. Nonono.

Gintama making bold statements on the subject of gender identity. Katsura wins at the entrance game.

Hey! Hey! Youre all going to catch a cold and die. I see why people adore Spyair.

*****

**Ep. 203**  Not enough room for two trannies? Cant take thuggish Yamazaki seriously.  Hijikata no! Think of your appeal to the female fanbase! Awesome Code Geass speech, Jerkaiser. Madao: voice of a generation. Its rough being the straight man in Gintama. Just look at the onslaught of crazy were getting. This is what happens when each character obtains what they want even to the slightest degree. It devolves into crack ship teasing and the-baby-is-yours attention seeking ^^not ^^that ^^I ^^mind . Right when I thought all had wrapped up nicely.

Welcome back, Gintama.

*****

**Ep. 204.0**  Gin stirring up the audience because he doesnt want to do actual work after a year off. In agreement that Sakamoto is undeserving of his fame. No need to be in such a funk, Katsura. You placed so well in the popularity poll!

> Do we know any normal people?

Actually racked my brain there for a second. [Otae calling the Stalker Duo pets]( https://i.imgur.com/4A9OKVO.gif ). Dear lord, how long is Hasegawas card? 

**Ep. 204.5**  Knocking out the seasonal manga material today, show? The Kagura expressions have gotten infinitely better. Every second Tsukky is on screen fortifies her position of Best Girl. ITS THE HICCUP!!! And theres the violence. Im convinced that some of you would take that chocolate-dipped Sacchan. 

> Ive never tried doing it the normal way

Sacchan pls. Something about the following bridge scene broke me. Kagura dont need no chocolate, but spurned Gin and Shinpachi do.

*****

**Ep. 205.0**  Driving home the Yamazaki x Anpan shtick. Downside to better production values: the mayo-drenched ramen is all the more real. And so goes the descent of Anpanman. Dont take it out on the anpan! I find it sad that I can relate to going an entire weekend without holding a conversation. Collapsing into the anpan singularity. Daw, I like how these little gestures are all that are needed toand baited. At least we get a revenge SPARKING at the end.

**Ep. 205.5**  HOME RUN! Penetrate what giant wall?

> My relentless rain of love has finally spread open her tightly shut legs

Rivals Gins overtly sexual remark in the correspondence arc. Fifty Years of Bad Luck in Fifty Meters is almost poetic. Its the thuggish kids from, like, 100 episodes ago! Never restrain yourself, Kagura. Something about the shows comedic timing feels even sharper than before. Alright, Sorachi has lost his mind. [FLCL Episode 4](/s "Kondo really swung the bat! Shame about that foul tip into Otaes head.")

*****

**Ep. 206**  Ginpachi-sensei! Gintama keeps it classy and sticks with the apostrophe for its sequel. His Justaway pointer turns into an Elizabeth pointer! 

Oh boyCatherine episode. 10 Yottabytes? How much storage does Tama have? [Gin has a drinking problem]( http://media.giphy.com/media/kdM3zfq85XSb6/giphy.gif ). Everything is moving so fast! Im sure that the chapter of the manga is a bit older but its still impressive to see a Lehman Brothers reference slipped in a few months after the [Section 363 Sale]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers#Section_363_Sale ). Convinced that Tama is knowingly messing with Gin. Catherine, stay in lovestruck mode please. Its not like your nest would be empty without Catherine, Otose. You still have three stray cats and enough storage in human form to last you a lifetime. Show, where did your concern about the PTA and complaints from the network executives go ^^not ^^that ^^I ^^mind ? Lol *Evil 4 Lyfe*. Show is openly mocking this section of the new-romantic-interest-betrayed-me-after-we-ran-into-the-sunset storyline. Have to admit that Otose delivers in the shows contemplative and/or serious moments.

*****

I noticed when browsing Google Images for gifs and screenshots that the amount of suggestive fanart and dangerously absurd pairings is beyond easy to come across. So I thought Id have a little fun with it. Eat your heart out, /u/WisteriaHysteria. Its time for:

###Crack Ship Corner

She is known to him simply as "Leader". He wants nothing more than a brighter future for his country and works tirelessly though sometimes aimlessly toward that goal. She just wants to be seen as an adult in the eyes of those that gave her a place to belong. Perhaps its an act of loyalty. Perhaps a heated moment after a Curry Ninja operation. Or twisted destiny. Ladies and gentleman. Desperate shippers. Unashamed readers of doujinshi.

**Ep. 193** - Kagura wants to marry Colonel Sanders, got it. Otae at a cooking class? I can't imagine this going well. And she dragged Kyubei into it, nice. Also Kyubei wants to marry Ronald McDonald, okay. All things considered I probably wouldn't say no to Wendy. Yes, Sacchan too. Back to the natto thing with her!

Cooking is about love, eh? I wouldn't necessarily disagree with that, I love food. While they're debating over a unified target, everyone else just goes ahead and cooks. So many cultural references here that I just don't get.

Eventually they rally and... don't make anything good. And then it turns into a concert with the ED. Recycled ending segment! This time they admit the show really is ending after this season.

---
**Ep. 194** - Yato High: strange, kinda funny.

So there's a big Shinsengumi raid in the works and Kondo has a big load of snot hanging out. So many Final Fantasy references from Hijikata.

Eventually the snot... takes over? He uses it as a weapon at least, nice. Wait, it's sentient? I was about to write that this just got weird, but no, it's really just par for the course in Gintama.

So according to the snot it's the true identity of Kondo, an alien intelligence that came to observe Earth. It took over a gorilla and then made it into a human... Couldn't just get a human in the first place?

The snot gets all sentimental about being blown into a tissue but Hijikata isn't having any of it. Turns out it was just a dream anyway, oh well. Even Toshi has weird dreams!

---
**Ep. 195** - Ketsuno uses fortune telling to predict the weather, really? I'm surprised she's gotten it right as often as she has. Huh, this story's going to be about her I see.

Gin's really trying to show off for her and I don't know if I've seen him like that before. I like that she seems to take to Kagura at least. Gin's right, they can handle some trouble.

Well, maybe not the demon at the ~~door~~ ~~wall~~ hole where the wall used to be. Just as quickly... she banishes it? This is one fearsome weather lady. Why is she completely unfazed by that?

Okay, so her family serves the Bakufu as... demon hunters or something? I had to look up what an [onmyoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onmy%C5%8Dd%C5%8D#Onmy.C5.8Dji) is. Divination, protecting the realm from evil spirits, can summon [shikigami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikigami), got it.

So Gin decides to go investigate her family because he has a good point about her becoming a weather lady despite having that kind of position/family.

Keep ringing that doorbell like an angry Avon lady, Gintoki. Wait, that ended poorly. And now he summons a girl from a funeral? Ouch. Never mind, was all a trick.

Evil spirit bound against her will, eh? Gedomaru... I've seen the name before, when I was looking up other roles for Ayako Kawasumi, one of my favorite voice actresses. I approve of her so far. And then Christel's brother shows up. Should make for an interesting time.

---
**Ep. 196** - I guess the rest of the Ketsuno clan isn't behind this after all, if they're trying to change the weather to whatever she predicted. Neighboring clan fighting with them... and she married their head to stop their feud? I remember hearing that she got married and all relatively early in the series, but I have to wonder if this was planned way back then.

I missed on what way Seimei loves his sister (aside from him selfishly taking her back from the other clan), but Gin and Kagura are implying romance here and it's amusing. Gin obviously wants to marry her so he's already treating Seimei like a brother, nice.

So this is all about a scorned ex from a long-feuding rival clan that can also control spirits and the weather? Okay, makes sense. Gedomaru attempts to convince Gin to give up but he obviously isn't having any of that, so on to the tag team battle!

---
**Ep. 197** - The first challenge is a three-legged race and eating contest? Not exactly what I was expecting from a guy that summons demons. At least the thing they have to eat has an appropriately occult name. It looks pretty gross too, but I wouldn't be surprised if Kagura found it tasty. Wonder if she's hungry?

Except Shinpachi accidentally kisses it. It suddenly looks a lot cuter! That entire scene nearly had me falling out of my seat on the bus trying to stifle my laughter. Was that Gedomaru imitating her voice at the end to give him some peace of mind?

(Addendum: /u/ChuckCarmichael pointed out that Pandemonium-san has the same voice actress as Sawako in [Kimi ni Todoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6045/Kimi_ni_Todoke). We're finishing the group discussion of that *today* so this is even more hilarious to me right now.)

Well they're both disqualified. I love how Kagura just kinda bounces after Gin slaps the back of her head. So on to an actual tag-team match to determine the winner. Douman really didn't get far with that villain monologue. And then Gin doesn't let him get out of the ring, nice. Wait, dude can teleport? Not cool. I'm also not buying the illusion bit.

Then Gedomaru knock Gintoki's balls off by accident. The ensuing battle between Seimei and Douman using one ball each is ridiculous even by this show's standards. Ouch, Gedomaru squashing one of them made me wince.

Seimei's done with the weak stuff, time to call in the big guns.

---
**Ep. 198** - We interrupt this battle to bring you the villain's backstory to justify the beatdown that they're about to receive from our protagonists.

I really like the style used in the story about the founding of the two clans. Antenmaru causing an endless rain over the city? Hm, that sounds familiar.

Nice to see that they got along as friends when they were kids. Sucks that Douman's father forced the rivalry on them.

Aaand he's a demon now, right on schedule. This one might be tough even for Gin. Particularly Gin lacking balls. Kagura and Gin are too dumb/stubborn to give up though and Shinpachi isn't going anywhere without them. Kagura clinging to the demon's arm while Seimei delivers a monologue is pretty fun to watch.

Fighting over a woman: the cause of summoning infernal forces for millennia.

---
**Ep. 199** - Oh my, Gin, what are you gonna do with that glowing sword? Aww, Douman's fighting back against the demon.

That's quite the storm. Otose is not impressed with the other weather reporters, but Christel stands strong.

Naturally, Gin shoves his empowered attack straight up the demon's ass and banishes him once again. I expected Gedomaru to have a bigger role in all this, oh well.

Aww, Gedomaru respects Gin. Hope to see her again in the future. And the two clans can't give up on competing, even if it's for a sendoff.

---
**Ep. 199.9??** - Heh, back to advertising the Benizakura movie. Life insurance? I don't recall that happening. Kagura's memory isn't much better.

Wait, DJ Katsura? I want to see that. I'm so confused, but so is Shinpachi so I'm not actually missing anything. It really was all one big advertisement!

---
Not a bad arc, but I wish both Christel and Gedomaru were more involved. They got overshadowed by the whole warring clans thing.
>> ARTICLE
>Was that Gedomaru imitating her voice at the end to give him some peace of mind?

As I wrote in another post, I don't think the Pandemonium-san with the cute voice even existed, it was probably just Gedomaru screwing with poor old Patsuan the whole time. She just doesn't seem like the type of character who'd help the show's doormat.

Since I finally caught up I feel I can answer this question.

**Favourite Episode** - It would probably be between episode 142 or 180.           
**Favourite Arc** - That would probably go to Yoshiwara in Flames.        
**Favourite Character** - It would have to be ~~Paako~~ [Gintoki](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140205073645/gintama/images/6/62/Gintoki_Shinsengumi.jpg).  
**Favourite OP** - That would go to [Stairway Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9IRgGjOK0)  
**Favourite ED** - [Sanagi](http://vimeo.com/83831329)  
**Favourite Quote** - This one took me a while to think of but I'd have to go with this one from episode 105 from Gintoki just before he overpowers Banzai in the helicopter. 
 > I couldn't care less if the country or samurai fell. I have always... Then, and now... What I protect... has never changed.

That or the /u/parameterized has from Toshi in episode 163: 
> And the traces of the path we lived will be burned into the ground.
>> ARTICLE
Congrats on catching up! That had to be no easy feat.

Seems like you agree with the countdown from episode 176 on the quote. That moment was as awesome as it was ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
> Seems like you agree with the countdown from episode 176 on the quote. That moment was as awesome as it was ridiculous.

Yep, for me it was the most memorable "Damn, this is crazy but I love it" moments. Especially when paired with the song that was used.

I started watching back in September and was watching an episode whenever I had the time. So now at least I can slow down my pacing a bit more.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode** - 165, with the flashback to all of them being sick.

**Arc** - Popularity Poll for comedy and overall, Yoshiwara is Burning for serious arcs.

**Character** - Tsukuyo. I also appreciate a great straight man in comedy and Shinpachi delivers.

**Opening** - The current one, [Light Infection](http://vimeo.com/74234484). This is at least partially due to their own parody of it.

**Ending** - Much harder to choose. Most of the recent endings starting with [The world is Yours](http://vimeo.com/8033245) are fantastic but right now [Wo Ai Ni](http://vimeo.com/62488327) gets my pick.

**Quote** - I don't remember quotes well so I'll have to defer here. Most of Gintoki's lectures at the end of major arcs tend to be great though.
>> ARTICLE
> 165, with the flashback to all of them being sick.

Ah yes, that would win the "most outrageous episode" award if there was one.

From Shinpachi *thinking* of the OP to the messiah "Ill Smith" turning up and inhaling the virus just to get a green onion stuck up his ass by Kondo and unleashing the virus from said ass.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, the sheer ridiculousness of that one wins for me.
>> ARTICLE
Crap, I thought I had all of your questions covered. I've been outwitted.

**Quote** - From episode 163, Toshi's speech on rejecting legacy:

> And the traces of the path we lived will be burned into the ground


>> ARTICLE
**Fav episode:** 166, where Gin and Toshi were tied together courtesy of the fabulous Sougo.

**Fav arc:** Definitely the Popularity Poll arc, that shit killed me.

**Fav character:** I would kiss the floor that Hijikata Toshiro walks on. *Talk dirty to me, boy.* Actually, talking about anything would be cool, that voice...(()

**Fav OP:** Toss up between DONTEN and Pray, but who am I kidding, TommyHeavenly6's voice is absolutely beautiful. I could listen to Pray all day, it's definetly my favourite. 

**Fav ED:** *~Mr.Raindrop, fallin' away from me now..~*

**Fav quote:** ~~Everything that Hijikata says is my favorite~~ 

I really love Gintoki's:

*"If you have time to think of a beautiful end, then live beautifully until the end."*

Closely followed by:

"**ZURA JA NAI, KATSURA DA!!**"
>> ARTICLE
> Actually, talking about anything would be cool, that voice...

The first episode of Death Parade must have been a treat for you, especially with Kazuya Nakai projecting such a large range.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I'm really bad at identifying voice actors. On a related note, [Death Parade's OP is amazing.](http://a.pomf.se/tbttld.webm)
>> ARTICLE
Dat ass cheek. 100% agreed. Wasn't expecting that OP at all and I absolutely adore it.

I must say I'm falling in love with NoisyCell and their wall-o-sound chorus tendencies. [Last Theater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcLwLhNcEzI) rivals [Innocence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pffJj1Bca1s) in quality.
>> ARTICLE
So it was Hijikata's VA in the first episode of Death Parade? I was about 90% sure that it was him in that first episode. I'm glad to know that I was right.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama VAs are everywhere. I've been told that it's one of the more stacked shows in existence and the in-joke is that the budget is blown on the voice cast.

* It's gotten to the point where I recognize Fumihiko Tachiki as Hasegawa over Gendo. That's where my mind went when watching Barakamon.
* Grinned stupidly when I heard the Department of Defense character in Assassination Classroom yesterday as there is a tinge of Gintoki in that voice.
* I watched Clannad first but now I can't hear Sunohara without picturing Shinpachi.
* And of course Rie Kugimiya is the Tsundere Queen. Couldn't get Kagura out of my head while watching Expelled from Paradise.
>> ARTICLE
I need to rewatch Clannad now, over those years I never knew Shinpachi has the same VA as Sunohara. As for the others, yeah. Especially when I hear Sugita Tomokazu now. Kyon is gone from my mind...
>> ARTICLE
I feel kind of sorry for Kugimiya. I saw Gintama before any of her other roles, so now whenever I hear the voice that is apparently supposed to be the Queen of Tsunderes, all I can think is, "Where's the aru?"
>> ARTICLE
>  I recognize Fumihiko Tachiki as Hasegawa over Gendo.

Yep, that's how I am now.

> when watching Barakamon

Wait, he was in Barakamon? I must've missed that one.

> Department of Defense character in Assassination Classroom yesterday as there is a tinge of Gintoki in that voice.

So I wasn't the only one huh? This is what Gintama has done to us!

> I watched Clannad first but now I can't hear Sunohara without picturing Shinpachi.

It helps that both their characters are the comic relief characters.
>> ARTICLE
Tachiki was the [Vice Principal](http://myanimelist.net/character/106363/Kazuyuki_Sakamoto) according to the [Wikia](http://barakamon.wikia.com/wiki/Kazuyuki_Sakamoto). He didn't have much screen time outside of a few ending segments that involved fishing for crawfish / crayfish / crawdads.

That would explain it then. Still pretty cool that he was in Barakamon though.

Yes the almighty Sugita is in Assassination Classroom and will be there pretty frequent, so get ready.

So much bonus art!

**Ep. 193**  Uh oh, the CrunchyRoll comment section is nothing but a defense of Shinpachis character.

Gins playful Kagura insults have been on the rise lately. Kagura has some tactical marriage plans. Im so ready for Otae to burn everything she touches. Kyuubei has some old-school household stances. Natto will never not be disgusting. Wow, insulting the teacher harshly off the bat. The most unladylike line of conversation is developing. More ineffective bleeping. Yeah, Shinpachi is gonna end up with an aneurysm at this rate. What is Rxxe21? TL Notes, halp! I am so hopelessly lost right now. Lol did they superimpose a picture of food? IT TALKED! Show, what are you doing? Show. I cant.

Its the time-killer segment! I dont want to think about my Ben Johnson eventually falling out. Shh, Shinpachi. I almost didnt recognize the scene as recycled. Shh, I want to hear whininess from the staff. Makes me want to go back and look at the title card for the countdown. Yet another risqu DVD cover. That trailer needs to be much, much longer in length.

*****

**Ep. 194**  Even Kamui succumbs to a high school segment. Abuto would not do well with [Tokyo Ghoul 11](/s "Jason torture whilst subtracting"). I would transfer too, nondescript "teenager". At first I wanted an entire episode of shorts but they got absurd fairly quick.

Oh hey, they finally ended the OP at a better point in the song. That always bugged me. Admittedly excited for a serious raid. Seeing Kondo as a solemn leader and the Shinsengumi in ranks does the heart good. Welp, so much for that. I love how Hijikata is more concerned about Kondos frail serious-mode breaking than the apparent danger of the situation. Sentient booger? Jesus, Hijikata, you mowed through those faction members AND Yamazaki like it was *nothing*. Kondo is going full-on parasite with his weaponized snot. Show, dont you dare play the Mitsuba death song for this god damn snot. INB4 this is a dream sequence. Sometimes I wonder why I put up with you, show.

*GINPACHI-SENSEI*! Lock your doors and windows, or you may wake up to a frazzled Madao. 

*****

**Ep. 195**  Gin following in Kondos footsteps achieving actualization this week.

> Its my fault for giving an inaccurate forecast

Theory: Sorachi gets his assistants to give him a silly line like this and he has to craft a serious story around it. Not fooling anyone, Gin. Lecture mode counter increment. Cant even bother to ease us into the madness today, show? Ketsuna the meteorological force of good in Edo. Totally outclassed by these shikigami. Setsuko no! What an adorable little grieved demon. This fight song is fantastic. Dont be so easily intimidated, Gin! Some interesting subtitles for the chanting. Seimeis rocking a sweet ponytail.

> Hint: Its not Kamotarou

So its Kamotarou?

*****

**Ep. 196**  Well that was resolved easily. Things you dont do: mess with Kaguras food. Weather forecast > Spiderman. Im not entirely sure what Im seeing but its very pretty. I wonder if this marriage backstory was planned when Ketsunos divorce was first made known in Episode 45. Solid heavier tracks in this arc. Seimei and Christel are quite alike in their stubborn, depressing resolve. Shikigami Tag-Team Mystic Death Match hype! Gedomaru casting Seimeis death flag preemptively. Shes admittedly cute when not emotionally manipulative and making ominous threats. Lecture mode counter increment. President Gin. *What* is that face, Kagura? No Shikigami Tag-Team Mystic Death Match? ): Shinpachi pls.

*****

**Ep. 197**  Gin is clearly forgetting a certain best girl in all this. Shikigami Tag-Team Mystic Death Match hype! Well Shinpachi is fucked. [Ill be seeing Pandemonium in my dreams tonight](http://i.imgur.com/dThg6Hf.png). Poor Shinpachi, kicking off his romantic life with a larvae. What is it with Kagura and vomit? Gedomaru very considerate helping Shinpachi overcome his loss. This arc kicks ass in the music department. Gin goes right for the anus as expected. Hemorrhoids are becoming as common as baldness in the show. [Felt that from across the screen](https://i.imgur.com/GeFGjZ2.jpg).

> Come back, testicles!

His genitals have suffered a lifetimes abuse *before* today. No idea how they were even allowed to show this. Oh shit, the fight is on tomorrow.

*****

**Ep. 198**  Ready for Doman v Seimei. Were the subs backwards for a line after that DBZ reference for anyone else? Willing to bet that someone counted those 1562 flaming wards. Backstory time. Interesting story entertaining a cyclical view of history. Love how the younger Mikado brother met the fate of what bonded him to his brother initially.

> Split in half like a dirty ass

Shh, show, this is serious backstory.

> Todays that day

Gintama filling in the need we have for menstruation jokes in anime. Doman, no! Youre playing into the repetition of history and continued suffering! Now Semeis gotta break the cycle. Toyas out for blood!

*****

**Ep. 199**

> Give me more until its hard and stiff

Gin pls this is the serious climax. I approve of this use of the Mitsuba death song. I like this argument over who gets to break the circle. Seems like theyve been fighting for that this whole time. Lol these redshirt weathermen. Looked like it hurt when that can smacked Christel in the head. 

> Rain must eventually end. Clouds must eventually part.

Going to miss these lines when Gintama finally comes to a close. They are a bit on the nose in addressing the ideas of an arc but are expressed in such a way that I cant help but smile. Damn that beacon shot. Look, Doman! Youve indirectly attained what you wanted to see! Gin, the Ketsuno clan control the weather. You can probably get something cool. Dont settle for a signature. Sup Doman? Was that a Nine-Tailed Fox? What a specific horoscope. Ketsuno cant subtle. 

Benizakura movie hype! Gin pls, youll never have money. That defeats the purpose of the premise. Wouldnt even be surprised if those volumes of the manga had increased sales after that plug.

I was going to do this next week after we finish off 201 but I wanted to make some time to write an actual analysis of the show for /u/cptn_garlocks Not Currently Airing thread next Sunday. So now:

Out of curiosity I went back and checked all of my posts to do the same. I came out to 20,926 total and think it's really strange that we're within 200 words across that long of a time frame (particularly when I decided to change how I wrote starting with episode 125; my weekly average word count jumped from 280 before that point to 1390 after).

>Gedomaru very considerate helping Shinpachi overcome his loss. 

I don't think Pandemonium-san (cute version) ever existed at all, I think it was just Gedomaru fucking with Shinpachi through ventriloquism. It would fit her character more than helping him.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that is probably what was implied when they panned to Gedomaru hiding behind the tree. I'm so conflicted with her outward cuteness and inward malice that I don't give her credit for her hijynx.

The OST during this arc was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
>Opening 9: "Tougenkyou Alien" by serial TV drama

>Ending 17: "Samurai Heart (Some Like It Hot!!)" by SPYAIR 

Both my favorite OP and ED, and my favorite action arc starts at 210. It's gonna be great.

>(It is called Gintama' but who cares I shall call it season 5.)

As Gin said in episode 206: [It's only a joke about the pronounciation of the show's name, but I'll put a spoiler here none the less since it's from a future episode](/s "Some of you may have already noticed, but there's this little dot here. Kind of like a secondary sex characteristic. But it's not pronounced Gintama Dash or Dot. Due to grown-up circumstances, there has to be something here. Because grown-ups grow hair down there. But it's still pronounced Gintama. Grown-ups keep their mouths shut when someone's unshaven.")

tl;dr it's still just Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
First-time watcher here. I slipped a little and took a peek on next week's episodes for the first time (until 205 :P) and I have to say that Tougenkyou Alien hit me like a brick from the first second. Insta favorite and not only in Gintama. Haven't fell in love with an OP like that since Sorairo Days!

But then also came Samurai Heart, which became one of my best gintama EDs too. So I have to say that this is the best OP&ED combination in Gintama by a mile!
>> ARTICLE
then you will love it when the variation of the op comes... i forgot which ep, but keep your eye out.. lol...
>> ARTICLE
SPYAIR songs featured in the anime are awesome, they sound like Gintama.

It's not unusual for series this long to be hit-and-miss with OPs and EDs, but Gintama's track record is plain incredible. The hit-to-miss ratio has got to be *at least* 7:3.

You gotta realize this series started way back in 2006.

The animation gets better with each season.
>> ARTICLE
Animation gets progressively better throughout the series. This is episode 163, which is not even a serious but a joke arc. 

When you watch the Benizakura movie, which replaces episode 58-61, is the first time where you get amazed by the animation I guess.

The animation in Gintama is one of the best I have seen in anime so look forward to that.

I jumped on ths Gintama rewatch(watch in my case) thread on week 3 after considering seeing what the fuss is about (and generally avoiding shows over 100episodes).

However due to severe lack of self control i am now find myself on episode 69 of this wonderful series. So the only thing i can contribute to this thread is a thank you for getting me to watch Gintama.

p.s First Op is best op so far.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I kept hearing about this show randomly all over /r/anime. After 3 weeks I'm over 200 episodes in.
>> ARTICLE
You'll probably change your mind on the favorite OP at ep 100. 
>> ARTICLE
Episode 151 is the start of Stairaway Generation, my personal favorite.
>> ARTICLE
The ending at around 160 is my fav.
>> ARTICLE
I look forward to any OP on par or greater than the first. I could easily place the first op in my top 20.
>> ARTICLE
I can guarantee you that you could look forward to better OPs in the future. 
>> ARTICLE
Finally the JOY4 (joui 4) is complete with Takasugi Shinsuke and Sakamoto Tatsuma's debut  
But we all know that Gintama's character introductions will never end.  
<3 ~~Zura~~ [Zurako](http://i.imgur.com/kcTgs21.png)
>> ARTICLE
So Ive been experimenting with the time of day that works best for viewing and Ive settled into an after-work slot as the show fairs well at unwinding me from the 9-to-5 grind. Likewise, the series appears closer to finding its groove, though it still bears of the mark of establishing itself and what it wants to do and be.


**Ep. 19** - Man, the random sketches and cutaways that exist separately from the main plot usually steal the show with Ginpachi-sensei being the stand-out. That being said, this episode exemplifies the structure that Gintama executes effectively: a light, self-contained story that plays as the background for the cast to fiddle with.


**Ep. 20**


> Otherwise, Sogo will discover the joys of sadism


The humor in this one hit its mark for me more so than any other episode yet. The pairings from the Shinsengumi and Odd Jobs just meshed together perfectly. On that note, I have found my ship and it is Sougo x Kagura. Make it happen, Sunrise!


**Ep. 21**


First half was endearing but forgettable, though it introduced an interesting idea in that not all of the Amanto are self-serving, seedy lowlifes corrupting society at large, and Id like to see this idea played with down the road.


Second half was much more entertaining with Gin as the unwitting action hero. His quips and remarks are a highlight and a heavy dose of that is welcomed.


**Ep. 22** - The character introduction episodes havent been my favorite but I found myself liking Sa-chan and the episode in general. My only concern is that Sa-chan, based on her appearance in pilot, will shoehorn herself into the same gags [hehe] repetitively, but I think I can trust the show to avoid that.


**Ep. 23** - Another character-centric episode and another war-time buddy of Gin. On-screen, Sakamoto was dull but his draw as a part of the cast is his unique take on the human-Amanto relations and how he used that to cultivate success and live up to the potential that Gin saw in him, so I like him. 


**Ep. 24** - Infectious homo liquid. That is all.


And thus ends the first season according to Shinpachi and the Wiki! While the quality had its ups and downs, I enjoyed myself consistently along the way. If this content were all that I had to go on, however, I would more than likely be among those who scratch their heads when viewing the top rated anime on MAL. Ill see yall next week for season 2!


Finally, out of curiosity, how many watchers in this group are first-timers like myself?

> Finally, out of curiosity, how many watchers in this group are first-timers like myself?

I'm also new to the show, but while others have gone far ahead I'm basically still forcing myself to watch to keep up. I've realized that unless I'm in a specific mood I really don't enjoy it.

Not that it's stopped the opening/ending themes from getting stuck in my head.

> Finally, out of curiosity, how many watchers in this group are first-timers like myself?

It seems like many first-timers who started Gintama because of these discussions couldn't stop watching and have watched far past the episodes being discussed. 

I have managed to restrain myself and just watch the episodes being discussed because I feel like I get more out of reading the discussions that way, but if it really gets much better from episode 25 (as many people say) then I may soon be joining the people watching ahead...
>> ARTICLE
Don't hold back, go all out if you feel like it!  
The purpose is to have fun after all.
>> ARTICLE
I would be inclined to agree with you based on the "I couldn't help myself and now I'm on [very large number] episode" comments. If the quality does greatly improve, I won't be one to blame you for getting ahead. I'll likely stay on pace with the group as I have a few series to show love to at the moment. For the time being, it is a pleasure participating in the group with watchers like yourself! :)

> Sougo x Kagura

Kagura is like, 14 yo.  That's a wretched pairing.

> My only concern is that Sa-chan, based on her appearance in pilot, will shoehorn herself into the same gags [hehe] repetitively

1. She doesn't get much screen time in general, so it never gets a chance to be too repetitive.

2. She's a fairly one-note character, but I love it b/c her S&M jokes are the best.  It's pretty refreshing for an anime to have that kind of sense of humor.

Sougo is younger than guys like Hijikata, but he's like 18ish.

Yup. Season 2 is where the staff loses their minds and starts making timeslot/viewership/everything else jokes.
>> ARTICLE
After watching to episode 25, episode 20 made it seem to me that the Shinsengumi x Odd Jobs episodes are the best ones. Having the two groups of lovable characters interact with each other is always funny.

I hope we get more Shinsengumi episodes in the next 6 episodes, that would really make my week.

Jesus i almost couldn't make it this week had to marathon the last 4 eps yesterday at 2 AM, but anyways.

**EP19:**

Holy shit was this a boring episode, i don't even feel like discussing this episode I remember that i almost dropped the series here, though i'm really glad i didn't.

**EP20:**
Now this is an episode worth talking about.   It had me laughing constantly, the character interactions were great and the show is finally starting to make good use of it's fantastic cast of voice actors.
It also looks like the rivalry between Gintoki vs Hijikata and Sougou vs Kagura is finally in motion.

**EP21:**
Part 1 was boring as hell, i feel the reason why these episodes don't work so far is because we simply don't care about the characters they're focused on.

That being said part 2 was great, not only because of the jokes but because of Sugita's unbelievable voice acting, it's moments like this when you realise that there really isn't anyone who could fit the role of Gintoki better than him.

**EP22-Ep23:**
These were very fun episodes, not only did they serve as character introductions but they packed a good amount of comedy.
Also  Shinpachi's role as the straight man is finally starting to make me laugh.

**EP 24:**
Well looks like Zura's descent into insanity has finally begun, plus we see the first mention of the 4 devas.

**Outstanding moments this week:**

* Gin chan and Hijikata being scared

* Gintoki's monologues on his bike

* [Gintoki and the metal detector](http://imgur.com/kJlSm5T)

* Kagura's engrish

* "Shall i draw a turd on your forehead?"
>> ARTICLE
I tried but I just can't keep up with 6 episodes a week. I'll do my best to keep close though!
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait for you guys to watch the first episode of next week...
>> ARTICLE
Watched 11 episodes this week to keep up. It's still hit or miss a lot of the time but I'm enjoying it more overall. Whether that's because I've gotten used to it or because it's gotten better I'm not sure. Some individual points:

* Captain Katsura was fun. I get that they were parodying One Piece but it was wasted since I haven't seen it. Not sure how I feel about Zura getting crazier though.
* Elizabeth is... eh. New ending is great though.
* Much like Shinpachi, I didn't want to spend an episode looking at/hearing about his sister's panties. Seems like most other people really liked it, but again it's not my preferred style. All of the landmine triggers were fun if predictable.
* The stories with the kappa Amanto and Gintoki hunting down a fan were both good.
* In general, I like any episode dealing with the dynamic between humans and Amanto. Terrorists and resistance plots are good.
* Sa-chan is my new favorite character in the show, but I hope she gets some character development beyond the pilot and her introduction. It's partially the glasses.

> Captain Katsura was fun. I get that they were parodying One Piece but it was wasted since I haven't seen it. Not sure how I feel about Zura getting crazier though.

Captain Katsura is a returning gag, and generally it's not a One Piece reference, it's a [Captain Harlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Harlock) reference.

> Elizabeth is... eh.

Woah, I can't abide by that.  Elizabeth is probably the greatest mascot in all of anime.

Yay, Sakamoto and Sacchan have been introduced. And also the okama. I watched this earlier in the week so now I forgot what I was going to say - I should start writing myself notes for next time. 

Gintoki's struggle with buying a fan has always been one of my favourite moments, and ghosts with Gintoki and Hijikata are fun every time. 

Zurako is beautiful :'D

I cheated and went to rewatch ep 25 too, but I'll discuss that next time. We're getting the first arc soon as well, next next week. It's a tiny arc but still something to look forward to. :> Next season is going to be fun.
>> ARTICLE
Some funny episodes this week, but I'm more excited for next week.  And I love the next ED, too.

Ep 19  I love how Oonishi just keeps coming back in references.  Oh, I remember making mix tapesback in middle school.  Good times.  Poor Hasegawa, no one cares about his feelings.  

Ep 20  Well, now we know what the Shinsengumi do in the evenings.  Did Kagura just smack Kondo in the butt?  Weird.  Also, I am now convinced that Konbanwa is the only way I will ever greet a ghost.

Ep 21  Kappa!  So cute.  Ah yes, the epic fan story.  Who knew that searching for a fan could be so exciting?  And I love how Gintoki makes the random people in cars cry.  And that guy, with the weird jumping dudes in latex.  I feel like they come back again?  And shouldnt Gintoki just have taken the money and ran?

Ep 22  Sa-chan finally makes an appearance!  While not my favorite character, she can be fun.  Although even Otose can beat her in a fight, ahaha.

Ep 23 - For years after first watching this episode, I mimicked Sakamotos laughter every time I drank--much to the annoyance of my friends.  Maybe thats why I drink alone now?

Ep 24  Oh, yes, good times.

When does the anime or rather manga get good? Everytime i try to start I just drop it after a couple episodes or like 20 chapters.

People will tell you Gintama is great from the start, in reality it really only picks up after 30-40 episodes. Thing is, Gintama is like a sitcom, you have to watch it loads to get invested in the world and characters. Once you do, it suddenly makes the first few episodes feel more meaningful. 
>> ARTICLE
People generally say that it's around episode 25 but it's been a while since I've read the beginning of the manga, so I'm not sure where exactly that would be in the manga.

>> ARTICLE
Zura janai Katsura da! 
>> ARTICLE
gintma isn't bad up to the 25.th episode but it gets way better at that point
>> ARTICLE
One thing to consider is that Gintama relies heavily on recurring jokes. Gintama plays a long term game - the early episodes are just laying the groundwork. In addition the usual jokes, you will also be getting stuff like the funeral of a character who has only been briefly featured offscreen and the pivotal role in episode 200-something who only featured in half of episode 2. 

Gintama requires and rewards commitment. 
>> ARTICLE
>Thats a lot of fucking anime to watch before it gets good...

That's why you don't deserve Gintama

25 episodes seems like a lot but the anime itself is also a whole lot longer than the standard 12-25 episode long anime shows that are airing now.
>> ARTICLE
gintama is like a standard 25 episodes anime (with decent quality) that has a sequel that is freaking awesome
>> ARTICLE
But then it turns into the best anime you've ever watched, so it's worth it.

Mind you that it's a show that pokes fun at japanese pop culture (including other anime, of course) with some serious arks in between.

And the fights are so goddamn glorious.
>> ARTICLE
[Never Forget](http://i.minus.com/i4HOUBZhoyiCS.gif)
>> ARTICLE
"Its like they're some evil anime corporation"
>> ARTICLE
Eh, the reason behind it is that Gintama was originally in a different timeslot, and they had to try to get viewers after Bleach (or something else). This lead to the overall quality being not so great.

At about 30 episodes in their timeslot gets switched and it gets SO GOOD.

Honestly give it a chance because it is so worth it. So many laughs.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think the creator for the manga just stopped giving a shit and did whatever he wanted and that turned out amazing.  

>> ARTICLE
Yeah no kidding. One of the main themes you see out of the staff of the anime, at least through the show, is that "holy shit we don't even CARE" and it's turned out great. The premise of each episode/arc is so ridiculous but it works.  
>> ARTICLE
I love how each arc feels like they're just winging it as they go. It starts out ridiculous and nonsensical, then ends up being fuckin' epic.
>> ARTICLE
They have MULTIPLE episodes that are just an exterior shot and dialogue.

Literally no animation. They talk about how they blew through the budget with some big fight scene or something earlier that season and just spend the entire 22 minutes on an exterior shot. It's amazing.

I agree, I have never laughed so much at a single image in my life.

Not sure why you're getting downvoted when you're clearly right. [The first 25 episodes aired at 7pm on Tuesdays before it was relocated to... 6pm on Thursdays.](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%8A%80%E9%AD%82_%28%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1%29#.E6.94.BE.E9.80.81.E5.B1.80) It hasn't ever aired during the late night hours, at least on TV Tokyo.
>> ARTICLE
I suspect because I said Gintama was ostensibly a children's programme and people don't know what ostensibly means.
>> ARTICLE
Only the 25 first episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I'm fairly certain Gintama aired at 6pm throughout its run.
>> ARTICLE
It aired there through the first season or so until it's low ratings got it kicked to late night. At that point the directors decided "fuck it" and did whatever the hell they wanted, making the show much better in the process and greatly improving the ratings.
>> ARTICLE
It changed days due to low rating, but I don't recall it changing time. Its second run aired at 6pm and was replaced by [this](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=14078). Its third run, also at 6, gave up its timeslot to [fucking *Aikatsu*](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=14566).

Hmmm, I always heard that they changed the timeslot, but just assumed that meant the time of day and not the day itself.

It started its run in a more popular block of programming, paired up with Bleach, and then was shuffled around later.

Glad to see someone bringing this up. I was going to watch it last night after seeing this post but i was a little intimated by the 201 episode count.

Honestly, when you want to get into shows with high episode counts, just watch them at your own pace. Don't feel the need to marathon all the way to the end.

I got into One Piece when it already had 450 episodes and I would watch an episode or two once in a while. Now I'm caught up and it's was worth it!

That's the problem. I can't...I marathoned One Piece.

They did a crossover episode in both shows one week, though it pretty much felt like two episodes of Gintama in one week XD
>> ARTICLE
Fun Fact - the guy who did SKET Dance was an assistant who worked on Gintama for a while.  That's why they did a crossover, because they're buddies.  If you're familiar with SKET Dance's sense of humor and general premise, and liked that, you need to watch Gintama.  They're very similar shows in terms of comedy and scenario.

What really? I think i am very interested in Gintama now.
>> ARTICLE
Why the downvote? He is right, there is a SKET Dance X Gintama episode - it's pretty funny too.

It's hilarious. I love how they talk about using the same voice actor for two of the characters. Apparently, the Gintama mangaka was a huge inspiration for the SKET Dance mangaka, and they were really happy to work together.

Definitely one of the better one episode arcs! I love that episode so much! It's so funny! (The one for Gintama, not Sket Dance, which is still pretty funny!)

Sket Dance is basically Gintama in a high school setting.

Hey, thanks !~

Is this worth watching vs. reading the manga?  I generally don't like to watch anime based on manga series because it's much more time-consuming and often filled with uh, filler.
>> ARTICLE
I almost always prefer source material, but Gintama is the one exception. Every VA is so spot-on, the animation is beautiful, the fourth wall is abused in the best possible way, and just about every OP and ED is a real winner.

Plus, as a comedy, it's seriously dialogue-heavy, so the anime is a lot easier to watch without having giant-ass speech bubbles everywhere.

If you end up watching the show, just mind you that most of what you'd consider to be filler... isn't. This show spends a lot of episodes on random ridiculously funny situations at the expense of its colourful array of characters. 

There's a big diversity in characters, but they are all incredibly retarded when needed. And that's what makes this show unforgettable ;D
>> ARTICLE
There are not many fillers and they are also as good as the manga adapted episodes. You probably won't ever notice them
>> ARTICLE
The anime is worth it for many reasons, but the biggest, glaring reason is Sugita. 
>> ARTICLE
I definitely recommend the anime for this one. They truly understand comedic timing and the voice actors are awesome. There is some filler but it's not your typical filler and I don't believe they ever do filler eps or arcs.  It always happens at the start of the episode too so the actual content is tight. They actually take breaks in the show to let the manga come out so they don't have to do filler. It's very well paced overall.

No, in fact crunchyroll's subs do put up explanations. The problem is when they put up a four line long explanation and it covers the top half of the screen, it's quite intrusive.  
Also at first they translate MADAO as DORK, but when later it becomes evident that the jokes only make sense if you leave the word as is, and then they feel the need to explain every time what madao means.

Not really, that's why I like it, it's a parody of modern harems.

Ah. It was like, my third harem anime, probably my 7th anime in total. 

I absolutely hated it. Every girl is a violent tsundere and the main character just pissed me off by taking it, not kicking them out of his house, etc.

Not sure how it's a parody to be honest! But if it is maybe I disliked it due to not watching enough harem anime.

If I was going to start watching, where would a good place to start be? I know they have a lot of episodes so that's why I'm asking.
>> ARTICLE
Start from episode 1, I know there's a lot of episodes to catch up to, but you'll appreciate the series more if you took the time to watch it from the start and get to know the characters even more.

I don't know why people keep saying it start's slow, but I immediately liked Gintama from the first few episodes and fell in love with it on it's first serious arc. 

so yeah,

**TL;DR**: Start from episode one, it's all gonna be worth it.

Thanks.

Second episode will be twenty minutes of a stationary shot of a house while actors do voiceover offscreen.

I thought the stationary shot was reserved for near end of season when their funding was running low. Also MSPaint.

Gin's past and over-consumption of media leaves him with the impression that certain tropes, storylines, and clichs are tiresome and not worth the effort.  Give it time and you'll see him have actual investment in what goes on around him. In fact, you'll see him get legitimately pissed off and unleash a hell of a rage on an opponent. But yeah, most of the time he'll act in direct opposition to what is expected of him. His attitude is basically "fuck it, I'd rather do *this* instead of following the script".

I don't think Gin even *has* a shit to give.

true.....just look at how poor he is

If Gintama has a lot of anything, it is a lot of shit.

What makes it more hilarious is that this is not the first time they mocked themselves.

There was mini-arc making fun of [small gintama spoilers?](/s "namco-bandai doing a crappy gintama game, and instead replacing it with 'tales of' and 'final fantasy'.")

Also, the whole "you guys need to learn special techniques so we can make a gintama fighting game" running joke.
>> ARTICLE
?
>> ARTICLE
That wasn't the first time they had a videogame. The Wii one (also Namco) had a bonus audio segment with Ginpachi-sensei randomly inviting one of the developers (for real) and was really hilarious. All their games (except their cameos in Nintendo's Jump Ultimate Stars and Namco's Jump Vs PS3, which are fighters) are board games or party games/VNs. But it seems the PSP game they were mocking is actually somewhat good.

Hilarious. Wow. Amazing reply.

The cool thing is, he can be surprisingly serious and insightful with these Q&A too.

[This](http://imgur.com/RsvRAvh) was his response to someone asking for advice on moving to Tokyo to become a mangaka, and trying to convince his/her parents for it. He politely says that (roughly summarized):

> There is no need to go to Tokyo. The great thing about manga is how you can draw it anywhere you are. Before you start talking about your dreams, you should begin acting on them. The first priority to becoming a mangaka is not to go to Tokyo nor becoming an assistant, but to draw manga. Enter shows and be acknowledged. Leave results, and by the time that happens, I think people around you will accept your hard work. Good luck.

walk up to him and give him money would probably be the best

>> ARTICLE
Haha I love you Gintama
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I want to preface this by saying I am a die hard Gintama fan...my favorite anime of all-time, which is a title I don't toss around lightly. But I am terrified of where the anime will end, because it has a lot of ground to catch up on if it wants to catch up to the manga. And if by some twist of fate the anime does not reach the current manga arc this season, I am so so so so sooooooooo worried we might have to wait another year and change to be able to watch the greatest Gintama arc, ever. This is not an exaggeration or meant to add hype to the anime's return, this is simply a fact, and it scares me to think it might not be animated with the return of Gintama. So they need to animate about 100+ chapters to get to the current arc, and then animate the arc itself. Can someone explain to me if this is possible or if we are going to have to wait until the season after this season after this?
>> ARTICLE
I'm hoping for a theatrical release of the arc. It's possible considering the scale of the story and the show's popularity.
>> ARTICLE
That would be pretty amazing, and I guess my only concern for a movie would be time constraints. It's either going to have to cut a good chunk of the content out to fit a 90 minute movie or they are going to have to make a really long movie (not that I'd mind that).

I'm convinced that Gintama's author is [this](http://f.ptcdn.info/620/001/000/1359200920-bakuman302-o.jpg) guy from Baccano and does whatever he can so that he doesnt have to write anymore.

That's Hiramaru from Bakuman. Idk, from what I've seen, Sorachi projects a very laissez faire and silly attitude, though his portrayal in the anime does support your theory.

42 here, for me it really did pick up after 30. I think it's really nice that I have so many episodes ahead of me that I can just watch 5-6 everytime I need a fix.

Especially Kagura's story from 40-42 got me so attached to her...

Im on 14. Kept reading that it gets real good after the first 10 episodes. Its mildly entertaining, I watch it before bed, sometimes fall asleep in the middle of a show well, heres to the next 16 episodes!

I watch it casually as well. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning I smoke a cig and watch 1 episode before going about my day.

No. It's around 40 that it starts to get good.

it gets exponentially better. And the "serious" arks are soooo badass.

So they are redoing Gintama? Or just adding to it I honest haven't watched Gintama yet.

I'm assuming they're just making more episodes. Gintama is a long running Shounen manga, they're probably just adapting more of it.
>> ARTICLE
Adding. Most people are expecting that they'll animate one of the best arcs in Gintama (the subject matter is supposed to be quite mature). 
>> ARTICLE
You mean the current arc ? Shits keep getting real and if they animeted these parts it will hit us so hard..
>> ARTICLE
I seriously thought last week was going to be the end of the arc, what with that bomb that got dropped. Seemed like a fairly peaceful end, with all the fighting being over.

But I guess it was pretty stupid to think things would just stop after something like that happened. I think this is Sorachi's longest arc yet.

Longest and darkest I'd say

Nothing will be the same anymore after what happened. It's probably ending T_T

Make sure to stick with it. Since you made it through Reborn, I'm sure you have what it takes to wait for the show to really hit it's stride but when it does, it really goes with it.

start at episode 1, the first 20 or so are mostly character introductions but its just a great ride overall

Gintama Re-watch week#3:

* Ep9: Great episode, The members of the Shinsengumi are all great characters and i love seeing them on screen.

Also to anyone watching the fan subs: Kondo  is **not** impotent, he has ass hair which is why people call him Gorilla.


* Ep10: I had completely forgotten about sadaharu's introduction, this was a nice episode since i love me some kagura.
Also that Time machine gag gets me every time.


* Ep11: Quite a boring episode Imo nothing much to say about it. Though I really liked Gintoki's monologue about strawberry milk.

* Ep12: Catherine introduction episode, Im not a big fan of her character but it was still a nice episode since we get to see a bit about Gin san's past.
Also  Kagura breaking Gintoki's finger was hilarious.

These 4 episodes were still pretty boring compared to the later ones mainly because we're still stuck in the introduction phase of the show.

Can't wait till we reach the 20's where the Show starts taking form.
>> ARTICLE
That moment when Otose is reminiscing about her past with Gin and he jumps out of the water to save her pretty much cemented my love for the guy.
>> ARTICLE
I really like their relationship. They both hate each other and are constantly at each other's throats, but she still lets him live in her house without really paying rent, and the moment she's in trouble he drops everything to save her
>> ARTICLE
Does anybody know why they stopped putting the purple idiot prince in the later episodes? :( He was one of my favorite characters. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry. Most characters in Gintama are recurring.
>> ARTICLE
Thing about the prince though, is that his appearances in episodes beyond the first 50 are kinda rare.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the author didn't like him, maybe the readers/viewers didn't like hm
>> ARTICLE
A good (but not great) four episodes.  We met a couple new characters, learned more about others, and had some epic hilarity (ichigo gyuunyuu!).  As others have mentioned, we still have several characters more to meet, some of which will be next week.  Woot!  I remember episode 13 being pretty awesome.  Im excited about watching 6 episodes, too.

Anyway, some thoughts below.  Theres apparently a direct correlation between my drinking and my loquaciousness.  

Ep 9 	I love how Kagura has this sudden flash of realization during Gins fight, but its just about soap operas.  
                Seeing early Gintoki-Hijikata interactions was a lot of fun.  

Ep 10  	Awww.Sadaharu!  
            Oh man, even the newslady messes up Baka Oujis name.  
	    And, I kinda love Otose.
	   The hes attacking her, but she just doesnt notice line was one of the earliest times that Gintama made me laugh so hard I couldnt  breathe.
	  Poor Sadaharu Number 1this reminds me of the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion.
	  Baka-Ouji has some bad luck.

Ep 11  Finally, the strawberry milk speech!  The most inspirational thing Ive ever seen.
	  Still loving Otose.  Theres no way shed give anyone anything!  I once saw her shoot down a passing space cruiser!  I dont doubt it.
	Ummhow did they get the motorcycle all the way up to the hospital room?
	Stupid Gintama, making me go from laughter to tears in 5 seconds.

Ep 12  Wow, I completely forgot about Catherine.
	I wonder if Gintoki has ever actually paid rent?
	I also want to know about Gins parents.
	Shinpachi looks so crazed with his, Gin-san, did you know?s
	I wish they had kept up the Ginpachi Sensei thing longer.
	Last time for the crazy bubblegum ending, I guess.  It cracks me  up with the nonsensical lyrics.  I love the next ED, though.

>> ARTICLE
>  I wonder if Gintoki has ever actually paid rent?

The first time I recall seeing him actually pay rent was sometime after 100 episodes. I don't remember specifically when, but I remember being thoroughly surprised.
>> ARTICLE
You're right; I do vaguely remember that episode.  As I recall, everyone was thoroughly surprised, haha.
>> ARTICLE
I am so looking forward to a few weeks in the future just to see how all the gintama newcomers will react. Seriously after around 20-25 it gets sooooooo good
>> ARTICLE
I'm still curious to when they're going to officially introduce the girl with purple hair from the OP
>> ARTICLE
Sacchan is the best!  Gintama's S&M jokes are some of the best.
>> ARTICLE
She won't be introduced until episode 20+   
but [this creature](http://i.imgur.com/RoFNV3T.jpg) is coming next week.

This isn't a creature. It's Elizabeth.

I absolutely love how hilarious this anime is getting; increase the episode count by 2? Hell yes I'm down.

While I was watching, I thought it was pretty awesome how they mentioned the [world cup] (https://i.imgur.com/Hsb0c8l.png?1), (coincidence? I think not) and this part just made me laugh [so hard] (https://i.imgur.com/MNxWYTZ.png).
>> ARTICLE
I love that the more episodes pass, the soundtrack becomes better.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama's OST is one of the more underrated soundtracks in anime.  For example: usually in a long running show, it gets to where the OPs are hit & miss and you'll skip listening to a number of them.

I NEVER skipped an OP in 250+ Gintama episodes.  They're all AMAZING.  
>> ARTICLE
Same here man, never skipped anything.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I didn't realize there was a weekly of gintama. I just started watching it yesterday, and I am only a few episodes in. Funny series so far though.
>> ARTICLE
I'll admit that it's a fun show if I'm in the mood for it, though I'm still not a fan of the physical humor (vomit, nose-picking, etc.) and shouting matches. I guess we're going to have a time machine gag every time someone gets run over?

Otose has more depth to her than I expected, and is my favorite character so far. Sadaharu's cute, though I'm wondering what his (her?) story is. 
>> ARTICLE
This was the last time machine gag as I remember so you don't have to worry about that at least.
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling that Gin-san is super strong. I heard there are also serious arcs, right? I almost can't imagine that with all this comedy.
>> ARTICLE
I think the first serious action arc happens around episode 60, so it'll take some time
>> ARTICLE
Yeah there are some great serious arcs that only a few anime can compare to.

I thought I'd stick with this, but now I'm on episode 54. Might as well keep the train rollin.

just found out about this so i will join the rewatching for next week! Gintama definitely deserves to be rewatched \o/
>> ARTICLE
I want to contribute here a bit. In Russia we have a very popular (probably the most popular) source/database of anime [world-art.ru](http://www.world-art.ru/animation/) which also has its top. And it looks like this: 

1. Great Teacher Onizuka
2. Steins;Gate
3. Clannad: After Story
4. Code Geass R2
5. FMA: B
6. Usagi Drop
7. One Piece
8. Beck
9. Gintama
10. Nodame Cantabile
11. The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya
12. Spirited Away
13. Hikaru no Go
14. Mushishi
15. Hajime no Ippo
16. Bakuman.
17. Monogatari SS
18. Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuiokuhen
19. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
20. Death Note
21. Cowboy Bebop
22. Cross Game
23. Nana
24. Skip Beat!
25. Code Geass R1
>> ARTICLE
Beck is a wonderful show. Glad the Russians like it as much as I do. GTO, as well.

Russian anime fans confirmed to be only anime fans without shit taste.
>> ARTICLE
I like Hikaru no Go, Skip Beat and Bakuman being there
>> ARTICLE
Holy Shit Beck! I approve!!
>> ARTICLE
Wow! Beck : MCS is there, that's my jam
>> ARTICLE
This is the best list.

Edit: My reasoning is the presence of  both GTO and Usagi Drop, and only one Gintama. 
>> ARTICLE
> only one Gintama.

into the trash it goes
>> ARTICLE
3 Gintamas is the lowest required amount of Gintamas for a list to be credible

Here's the Toplist from the mostly german database anisearch.com:

1. Death Note
1. FMA: B
1. Code Geass R2
1. Code Geass R1
1. Steins;Gate
1. GTO
1. Clannad AS
1. The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya

Oh, Toradora! is here. Also Death Note takes the first place, quite interesting.
>> ARTICLE
yea everybody fucking knows death note here. Its been on the tv quite often.
>> ARTICLE
\>german website

\>no Monster

I'm dissapointed.


>> ARTICLE
Probably because there is no dub of it. And it's pretty old too.
>> ARTICLE
Monster is on rank 50. 
>> ARTICLE
For some reason, I really like the idea of Russians liking GTO. Onizuka kind of has that "Fuck it, were Russian" sort of vibe. Never thought about it before, but yeah, it works.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting enough. Also this list has considerable amount of shoujo/josei anime (Usagi Drop, Nodame Cantabile, Nana, Skip Beat!) that you don't see in other lists.
>> ARTICLE
It makes me happy to know that Russians apparently really like shoujo/josei. I'm not sure why, probably just the disconnect between how the internet commonly depicts Russia and something like Usagi Drop.
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, mandatory 'people /= government' comment. By the way, Usagi Drop is my favorite slice of life anime.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mean that in a bad way. I meant it in the silly "Look at this truck in Russia driving down a highway at 90 MPH / 144 KM/H on three wheels" kind of way.
>> ARTICLE
Was about to point that out. Maybe drinking vodka while watching shoujos makes it a lot better
>> ARTICLE
I need to try it.

Thanks. Will try it out later. For science

I'll upvote since it seems that this took you some time to put together.

To be honest it would've taken a lot less time if I started working on it on Reddit instead of Excel, I just went full retard there.
>> ARTICLE
Importing the spreadsheet to Google docs would have worked, but this is way more pleasing to the eye.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see GTO is at least on *one* of the lists.
>> ARTICLE
That's...that's a lot of R2 love.
>> ARTICLE
HummingBird is the only website where the original series has a higher rating than R2.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually a really weird statistic. Normally, the second season is higher rated simply because the people who dislike the series never get to it. They drop it in the first season and then never touch the second season, resulting in slight inflation. On Hummingbird, the general userbase agrees that R2 was a large enough drop in quality from R1 that they even get past this inflation. My own opinion on R2 vs R1 aside, this is a pretty interesting statistic.
>> ARTICLE
I always thought of it as R2 having such a beloved ending, that it left a strong, good taste in everyone's mouth after the loveable trainwreck the actual season was. 
>> ARTICLE
The only part I didn't get was why he kept sneaking back into the school once he was long gone... It would have been easier with an entire freaking army to capture the people he wanted to protect from the school and keep them in the military base, but being smarter than everyone else and overcomplicating things is what leluch (sp) did best.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think R1 is much better than R2 simply because R2 is such an insane trainwreck. The ending saved it from having a lower rating than what I currently think of it.
>> ARTICLE
I actually felt completely different. I felt R1 was the trainwreck and R1's ending/R2 saved the series for me.  I even rewatched the series and came to the same conclusion. Of course, R2 (and R1) had lots of flaws themselves, but I just cant imagine Code Geass as a whole being better without R2. Maybe a better way of putting is I think R2 had higher highs and lower lows than R1. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel as if R1 was better because it was more strategic. R2 basically devolved into whoever had the best mech would naturally win. Oh shit that mech is so powerful, oh man now my mech has new stuff on it so I'm better, OH SHIT I HAVE A MECH THAT CAN DESTROY EVERYTHING WHILE STANDING STILL AND SHOOTING LASERS. Though the ending was very very good for R2 which is why people rate it highly imo. 
>> ARTICLE
I get that, but I dont see why people treat them almost as two different shows because of it.

R1 still had lots of strong mechs that single handedly turned around the battlefield and made strategy redundant. Examples include the the always incredible Lancerlot, Gurren and Lelouch's fucking Gawain)

R2 still had a lots of strategy and wit underneath the fights, including the escape from the chinese, the destruction of the tower, strategic positioning of the armies in the huge final battle. All of this that people *seemingly* forget just because there is a Lancelot and Gurren flying around.

You see. People act as if there are two extremes, R1 was prefect strategy and R2 was a stupid mecha-power circlejerk. But if you look closely, you can see each season actually has a lot of both. This is why I think the distinction between R1 being 'so much better' than R2 is just foolish. Strong Mechs and Strategy *is* Code Geass. If you just want strong mechs, go watch Gundam, if you just want strategy, go watch Legend of the Galactic Heros. But you cant just like Code Geass and then ignore half of what it is. Accept all of it or none of it.
>> ARTICLE
I just wish someone could explain to me why R2 was a trainwreck. What am I missing?
>> ARTICLE
I think it mostly boils down to the fact that the plot goes a bit haywire and introduces a ton of meaningless characters. I personally consider Code Geass one of my favorite animes but I honestly can't recall anything that happens between s2e1 - s2e22. It's very unmemorable save for the ending.
>> ARTICLE
[CG R2](/s "Sure you can! For example, one of the best scenes in the entire show is when Rolo kills Shirley. The bunney suit Kallen is all over the place too. What about how freaking cool Suzaku as a knight is!?")
>> ARTICLE
I'd spoiler tag that^ anyways. But yeah, that Shirley scene messed me up. Can't forget that

MAL should seriously combine all the Gintama series except for the movies .

By the time the new Gintama comes this year  im 100% sure half of the list of the top 10 would be Gintama for a long long time  and I love gintama but still !
>> ARTICLE
I agree that MAL should reconsider when they combine entries. However doing so presents some clear challenges.

Firstly there's the question of what you do on the database side when combining series. Delete everyone's old ratings or try to average them out? At some level you'll lose data because inactive users won't come back and change their ratings, and inevitably you lose the information of which half is higher rated (even though selection bias arguably makes that question meaningless).

Secondly you open the more difficult can of worms of what criteria should be used to determine when series should be combined? When the second season follows directly from the first in style? When they air within enough time of each-other? When the MAL user base votes that they should be combined? What about splitting up Death Note into two halves on the same basis or going all the way and rating individual episodes?

I think it's clear that MAL will need a better system for dealing with the fact that most anime now take up several MAL entries, in this age where increasingly a show will get an 11 episode first season, 9 or so 2 minute specials, an OVA episode, a split cour second season, recap movies and finally a sequel movie.

The solution that I do think will eventually be implemented will actually be some sort of franchise system, but even that presents the problem of how do you divide up something like all the Ghost in the Shell anime.
>> ARTICLE
Easy

Allow a rating for the entire franchise but also allow people to rate individual seasons/segments/episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Consider the following example with made up ratings that do not reflect my actual opinion:

GITS SAC 2 episode 11 is rated 8.48

GITS SAC 2 is rated 8.55

GITS SAC (S1 + S2 + Solid State Society + Solid State Society 3D + Laughing Man +  Individual Eleven + ...) is rated 8.62

GITS ( GITS + Innocence + 2.0 + ARISE + SAC + GITS 2015 + ...) is rated 8.34.

Personally I think that's a lot of data to process at once. Furthermore it would put a strain on the servers to store that much more data as well as all the calculations needed to pool all those numbers together. I don't think it's impossible or even a bad idea per se, but I do think it would be difficult to implement in such a way that it's nice to use (both in terms of performance and UI).

I always find it endearingly peculiar that the ANN top 25 has three Maria-sama ga Miteru seasons. By the way, it's a very pleasant series.

[All the seasons are on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4U0FQ15BX8D1-lCVHli3WNK7KhVOuBtH)
>> ARTICLE
Now that you've pointed that out I've been consumed by curiosity? Was it a belligerent effort by /u/ or some such organization in a bygone era? Do ANN's users happen to be similar to the other sites for the most part, but have an unusually high ratio of Class S fans? Is this an oddity of the algorithm ANN uses to get their averages?
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop and Baccano! both in the top 25 on hummingbird, with Bebop nearly in the top 5. Sounds like my kind of site 
>> ARTICLE
It's fairly out of date at this point, but if we're looking at lists, [there's also this AniMetaCritic List](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/) from The Cart Driver, which compiled the MAL ratings of a bunch of anime critics/bloggers. It's unsurprisingly slanted towards the kinds of shows beloved by people who like to write a lot of words about their media, but with a number of surprising picks as well.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow nothing in the top 11 surprises me, except maybe Aria. Didn't know it was that well acclaimed critically.
>> ARTICLE
It's likely just reflective of the general self-selection that goes into sequel ratings - if you're watching the third Aria series, you're probably a person who's inclined to like Aria.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game and Nodame in the top 25, could AniDB actually have good taste?!

Summer Wars should be bolded, looks like.
>> ARTICLE
Don't say such things around here, people will run you out of town for liking good anime.


>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed Cross Game, would you recommend the other 2? 
>> ARTICLE
If you have any classical training or just enjoy classical music, you will love Nodame. If you liked anything like Honey & Clover, you'll still like it even without that.

Summer Wars is basically my favorite movie ever.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. Think I'll also check out Summer Wars because I looked it up a while back and the bunny looks pretty cool from what I can tell. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved Nodame. It's a music slice of life, so if you're not into that, don't watch it, but the characters were nice, the music was fantastic, and I enjoyed it thoroughly to watch all 3 seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. I'm meh with slice of life. Last one I saw was Nichijou which was hilarious but I'll give it a shot if I'm in a slice of life mood!
>> ARTICLE
The AniDB results look majorly affected by the fact so many of their entries have so few ratings. Nodame has 6490 AniDB ratings compared to MAL 51210 ratings and Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season has 437 AniDB ratings compared to 8695 MAL ratings. Furthermore they seem to inconsistently amalgamate anime with all 3 Madoka Movies occupying a single entry and Mushishi Zoku Shou having 2 entries.

That's not to say that it's not possible that AniDB has good taste per se, but rather that their top rated anime list is messed up.
>> ARTICLE
Ima get rekt by downvotes for this, but **seriously,** why is FMA: B so universally loved? I watched the whole series 3 times just trying to understand what I was evidentially missing; as far as I could see it was just averagely good?
>> ARTICLE
One of the few shows that goes on for that long and actually has a cohesive, structured beginning, middle and end. Just a well told story is all.
>> ARTICLE
It's the anime equivalent of a western fantasy novel. Great world building, unique story, diverse cast, great character development, some twists and turns, satisfying ending, mix of action, drama, and humour, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I think to get at the top of lists like this, it's less important for it to be loved, than for no one to hate it. It also benefits from fame and popularity - it gets voted 10/10 by a lot of a newcomer anime watchers who have nothing else to compare it to.

It also exemplifies really well its genre. People who won't like FMA:B don't watch it in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Because its a perfect 10. The way they blend the dramatic moments with the soundtracks (and sometimes ED), the action is top notch, the VA's are *phenomenal* and its funny. 

Whats not to like? 
>> ARTICLE
different people like different things
>> ARTICLE
Can different people think different things?
>> ARTICLE
you don't say
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't mean that those different people liking different things don't have their own personal reasons for liking those different things.  lilelf29 probably was asking for examples of those personal reasons specifically referring to why people like FMA:B.

Basically, why do different people like different things?
>> ARTICLE
A big reason is because it's an easy to reccomend show, free of some of the dumb tropes that plague anime like random upskirts, MC's falling on vags, etc. I did like it a lot, but I definitely find some big problems with it, my main one being the ending. The main villain was probably one of the most boring villains in anime, and that ending was so shonen it was unreal. I actually thought that the original FMA was better, the villain was more interesting, and the beginning was much better (they skipped a lot in brotherhood)
>> ARTICLE
The biggest thing is that it's just a very solid show across almost all aspects. It is a great first anime and can appeal to everyone with a story that can be embraced by all, yet still holds quirks that make it uniquely it's own and uniquely an anime. It doesn't seem to excel at one particular thing, be it animation or sound or drama or comedy, but it still does all of those elements very well, and the combined overall goodness is it's biggest appeal. It's a jack of all trades in a way, and it just an overall balanced show. It also helps that the plot is one of the most well wrapped up storylines I can recall, and that "OHMYFUCKINGGOD" moment when everything comes together is really memorable.
>> ARTICLE
It has the largest draw and I think is consistently good in all aspects and all around very enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's universal. Anybody of about 12 or older could watch it and enjoy it. It's got good animation, well fleshed out characters, a great and original story, and plenty of philosophy. It's got funny, happy, sad, exciting, tense, scary, and thought provoking moments all wrapped up in one 60 episode series. It can be shown to anybody as a sort of "entrance to anime," yet a veteran watcher can enjoy it just as much. It has very few flaws (nearly none, actually) and does everything it tries to do extremely well. It covers all of it's bases; It ends the story in a satisfying way, it fleshes out it's characters thoughts, feelings, and actions and the reasons for each, it doesn't use bad CG and has an appealing art style, the pacing is good and doesn't leave much to be desired, it has a good english dub, and a million other things.

The show is just perfection incarnate. It's good because it doesn't fuck up. Steins;gate fans will admit that the show up until the latter half was slow and uninteresting. Gurren Lagann fans will say that Yoko was a bit overly sexualized, and that some bits at the end could have been omitted for sake of time. Cowboy Bebop fans (like me) will admit that the episodic nature bores some people, and the show is really only a 7 or 8 out of 10 until you've seen [spoilers](/s "the last episode"). But FMA:B is just ***good***. It's not that something about it is so keenly sharpened that it stands out. It's like a clean, sharp kitchen knife. It's not your sharpest, but it's flawless. It shines, no scratches, cuts everything equally without fail.

Maybe I'm exaggerating when I say it's perfect, but it's damn near it. I would go as far as to say it has no glaring flaws at all. But yeah. That is, at least, my take on why it's considered the best. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your detailed reply, you have convinced me to give FMA:B another try.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but as an FMA:B fan, I can easily admit the show leans too heavily on the action shonen tropes (The whole last few episodes in particular) and Ed and Al are very sidelined down the line. The first 13 episodes are also rushed through pretty hard, which makes some scenes lack a lot of emotional power. Not only that, the humour can easily come off as obnoxious due to its placement (IMO its better in the manga). FMA:B absolutely is great, and it does have a universal popularity factor that pushes it forward for the younger audience of anime, but to say it has no points of contempt is absolutely ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly your point about the rushed early story is why I recommend starting with FMA if you're at all interested in the fullest experience. I'd say as a whole the original FMA is much weaker, but after watching it first FMA:B's beginning was VERY short indeed. I didn't care too much because I wasn't really looking to re-watch all of that again, and I think that might have been something the creators considered.
>> ARTICLE
As I always say,  FMA: B assumes you've watched FMA, so it skims over the beginning
>> ARTICLE
> I watched the whole series 3 times to understand what I was evidentially missing...

There are shows that I adore that I haven't watched that many times.  Maybe you like FMA:B more than you think?


>> ARTICLE
I think Brotherhood is so widely enjoyed because it's the most western. Other factors help, of course. The source material was incredibly well-written, and the adaptation was extremely faithful. Few anime tell a single overarching story so well, connecting every dot and and plot point. I could talk about why I like Brotherhood for hours.

But if you ask why it's so universally loved, I think the lack of Japanese influence is a big factor. No difficult to pronounce names with difficult-to-translate symbolism, no unfamiliar references or settings, and very little reliance on puns or wordplay for humor. I struggle to think of anime with as little to do with Japan as FMA: Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
You could actually be on to something there as I would say AoT is similar in terms of being western and it didn't enjoy it.

The animation quality was flawelss in AoT, but just about everything else was pretty poor imo.
>> ARTICLE
How did it in Japan?
>> ARTICLE
Really average actually. I don't remember exact numbers but the Blurays sold under 10k, maybe closer to 5~7k, despite the manga's immense popularity. To put it into perspective FMA:B sold as well as Guilty Crown, slightly better than Dog Days S1 and less than Hyouka. 

FMA:B was quite a long series though so that may attribute to its low sales. 
>> ARTICLE
I've got another one:  Attack on Titan is also a strictly western setting.  Based on its popularity I'd say your diagnosis is correct.
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B is just the anime that appeals to the most people. There's lots of action which appeals to a younger audience, yet there's also science, strategy, and questions about humanity and religion which appeals to an older audience. There's some very sad moments and a lot of comedy. There's some romance but it doesn't spend too much time on it. While FMA:B is outclassed by other anime in pretty much every area, FMA:B is at worst considered averagely good and many people consider it the best anime because it has so many different aspects going for it.

Also great characters, soundtrack and animation.

I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time, as bold of a claim as that may sound. It's what happens when you mix in a perfect adaptation of the source material from an anime studio with absolutely phenomenal writing. And to have that consistency in both writing and animation for a full 150 episodes is what solidifies it as one of the best.

And not everyone shares that opinion as evident by a couple of top 25's. I think that's fine, it would be rather boring if everyone likes the same things. As they say, variety is the spice of life.
>> ARTICLE
That's true, and I'm not necessarily saying that these rankings are literally wrong just because HxH is not on it, because there are a lot of anime deserving of a top 25 spot. Simply explaining to /u/Heizenberg what /u/bloodgods was trying to say. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry I got it, it is pretty amazing for a production studio to achieve such a consistency, in 150 episodes! Can't think of any other mediums that have that, in any kind of media.

Yeah for me personally, i probably agree most with ANN(with animeplanet close behind) top 25 than the others, but my personal top 25 anime still doesnt match up with it.

Anime isn't 'dying' but I don't know why these charts would make for a convincing argument that it isn't. Most anime fans are only into anime for a few years and, particularly nowadays with the greater access afforded by widespread streaming, they tend to watch current material. What the airing year table tells us is that anime fans have only a very limited sense of the anime past.

Might get some hate for this, but since it's in 4 of the 5 lists now's as good a place as any to say it: 

Wolf Children isn't as good as everyone says it is, and I don't really think it deserves a spot so high on so many lists. 

Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with plenty of touching scenes and is, without a doubt, visually beautiful. But I don't think it's the masterpiece so many people seem to say it is. I'd hardly call ti equal to most Ghibli movies and, other than having a slightly unusual premise, wasn't anything too special. Since I should probably back up these opinions, I'm going to get into spoilers. So If you haven't seen it: turn back now.

My biggest problem with this movie is the ending(s). I feel almost totally robbed of an emotional climax. Ame becomes the real focus of the story for the last quarter and he's honestly kind of unlikable. For his big emotional scene all we get is a

"No, don't leave" 

"I have to leave" 

"Okay" 

kind of interaction. Which I suppose could be impactfull if they did a little more with it, but as is it feels very anti-climactic. Yuki doesn't even get that. All she gets is one confession of her identity (in an admittedly cool 'shot' where the curtains blow in front of her as she transforms and whatnot) to one kid. I found myself asking what this reveal is supposed to mean for Yuki. Does it mean she's accepted her wolf side even though she wants to be human? If so why does she continue into a life where her wolf side is so hidden? Again, it felt like some big realization or emotional peak was closely missed almost altogether. 

I'm also not a fan of the length/pacing. This movie is just under two hours, but not a whole lot really happens in that time. Some segments feel like they get a huge space of time to be developed even after we already get what's happening (I'm looking at you extended "it's hard to have young kids" montage) and others feel pretty rushed. (particularly the ending) 

It's a good movie, with an excellent premise that looks very nice and has a few interesting time lapse, POV, and other scenes. But beyond that Wolf Children really didn't blow me away like it did so many other people.
>> ARTICLE
All I did after Wolf Children was to go hug my mother, she's raised my brother and I by herself almost single-handedly right after migrating to Australia. The film resonates a lot with me personally so it's one of my top films.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a good film but I can't see any way that it's one of the best 25 anime titles. 

But then again if I wanted a really solid stab at that kind of list I'd assemble a committee of people I trusted and have them fight it out and then write up an opinion with collective responsibility, rather than aggregating the ratings of thousands of randoms.

It's interesting in a kind of anthropological way that thousands of randoms loved Wolf Children to bits.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I accept your opinion, but I disagree.

Let me start by saying that I think that Ghibli is generally overrated. It's sort of funny, because endings are generally where Ghibli falls apart. Miyazaki wants to tie things up too neatly, so the climaxes of his films tends to come out of nowhere, and break the themes and characters of the films just to wrap things up happily. Spirited Away is most egregious for this - no, the film is *not* about the main character's ability to supernaturally sense whether the pigs are her parents what are you even doing Miyazaki!!!

In contrast, I think Hosoda's films have endings that flow naturally out of the themes and characters. Even if this means that they are open ended, or often very unhappy.

The main character of Wolf Children is the mother, Hana. The theme of the story is this core question - can she hold to her resolution that she would allow the wolf children to make their own choices in life, and love them unconditionally for that? Even when the choice is one that she does not want them to make, that takes them away from her? The tension in the story is between that resolution and her desire as a mother to do all that she could possibly can for the children. The story ends when she finalizes this resolution, when the children develop their own choices, when the story moves on from her story to the untold story of these children and how they live the rest of their lives.

The point of the ending is that the viewer occupies the same mental space as Hana. Adulthood comes all too suddenly and against your will. An emotional catharsis is denied. There is no one big realization, only the culmination of small choices that take place without you knowing it. You become only a small part of someone else's story, a story that is denied to you. This is an incredibly brave and personal choice on Hosoda's part, and one big reason I find the film really special. I can understand it not working for everyone though.

(As an aside: Yuki revealing her identity is about the changing of a secret. Her wolf side was previously a secret shared by the three members of the family. Now it's a secret shared with one she loves. Thus, the secret of her wolf side is recontextualised, it's not something that holds her back any more from the human interactions she desires, and so something she resents and fears. But instead it's a moment shared, that binds her *to* those she loves.)
>> ARTICLE
Also something interesting to note is that Hosoda has been clear in interviews that the film is a tribute to his own mother. Yuki and Ame represents himself - the path he felt his mother wanted him to take, and the path that he did take.

I thought the Gintama manga was fairly amusing, but I'm surprised that it rates so high on so many of these lists.
>> ARTICLE
While you don't hear masses of people talking about all the time it's a constant undercurrent. I can't speak about the other sites but on MAL, along with other long shows, it also benefits from the requirement that you need to have seen a fifth of a completed title for your rating to be valid, which means a lot of the people who try and drop it don't register.

I suppose I shall have to try it myself one day.

Ok, lets do this... Clannad explain it to me. White album 2 is one of my favorite shows, the relationships portrayed in that show feel very genuine and the struggles the characters have make for a incredible show. I know almost nothing about Clannad other than the character designs put me (way) off and from the few screen grabs I have seen it looks like the literal poster child for generic moe blob harem show.

Are the characters well written? Is the setting actually interesting? Is it more than just a love dodecahedron? I think I just need a push to get over my gripes with how the characters look, but as a outsider it seriously just looks like the most generic 90's Harem anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Its not for everyone, but there is a reason why it is considered a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is rather generic yeah, but its still pretty well writen and the chars are likeable.

Now thw senbd season, Clannad:Afterstory(the one that appears on the tops), it's a whole different beast, while the first 8 ep are rather crappy, when the afterstory kicks in, it just leaves anyone speechless.

It's a family tale, a tale of reconciliation, and the feel trip is otherwordly.

PS: sorry for typos
>> ARTICLE
I literally stopped like 7 or 8 episodes in and haven't touched it yet. It just bored me to death, so I moved on to something else. Maybe I'll give it another try.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't give it another try, I watched the entire two series because people kept saying it got better. 

*It gets better after the Fuko Arc*

*It gets better at AS*

*It gets better in the second half of AS*

*The last few episodes make the series*

Complete waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
I came into afterstory expecting too much (reading all the hype for it) after watching clannad. I was always waiting for that special moment to happen and i was waiting to be impressed for the entire series yet nothing spectacular or minblowing ever happened. Sure there were sad moments but didn't make up for the boring first 15 episodes. So clannad and AS as a whole was a huge disappointment for me.

Do you think it is worth a rewatch in some time to maybe get a different opinion of it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i have to agree with you, and i didnt even get that much hype, only from my one friend(who got me into seasonal anime) and he loves literally everything japanese. He would basically be a weaboo, except he actually has japanese blood. So obviously i didnt buy into that hype and my reaction was nowhere near as positive as his. I really dont feel like the good emotional shit of the last 2/3rds of AS can justify watching through the mediocrity(imo) of most of the first season and the first 8 episodes of the second. Im only like halfway done making my MAL, and i really have no idea how the fuck im going to score the series.
>> ARTICLE
well overhype can ruin a lot of stuff, so is normal.
It really depends, for me i know it's worth a rewatch since i liked AS a lot, but you need to be conected to the characters, or the feels wont hit home run xD.

I would recommend you to start a rewatch, and if you see yourself in some of the characters, continue watching, if you don't feel any special interaction, it's probably better to just jump to another anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you know little about Clannad, by all means go in and watch it. Hype can a real destroyer for some people, and I'm grateful I watched both seasons of Clannad with an open mind. The character designs did throw me off a bit, but it only took minutes to get over it. I'm by no means well-versed when it comes to these types of shows, but it really packed an emotional wallop with an intelligent story supported by a super strong cast of characters. Honestly, I can only think of a handful of shows that measure up in quality with Clannad. 

Speaking of White Album 2, I'm planning on watching that after I finish K-on! It's been hyped so much to me, but hopefully I can approach it without any major expectations. 
>> ARTICLE
The second half of the second season made people cry so the entire show is amazing, that's what Clannad is.
>> ARTICLE
Did someone say [90's Harlem animation?](http://reenied.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Super-Globetrotters.jpg)

I'm guessing you meant Harem? Clannad is a slice of life comedy, the MC's ok, the girls are ok. The *feels* are forever. It is no where near WA2 in character depth or scope, but if you liked any KyoAni's stuff (K-On, Air, Canaan, Haruhi) then it falls in a similar category.
>> ARTICLE
> Did someone say 90's Harlem animation?

Lol fixed
> The feels are forever

This is the part I have heard about, and the reason I want to watch the show, but can you really feel a emotional kick when all the characters are just "ok." Oh and if the characters in Clannad have half the amount of awesome interactions Kyon and haruhi do then I think Ill enjoy the show quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Kyon x Haruhi is much better imo. But you get a solid first season of interaction followed by a story going legit sad. It puts more effort than most shows. If you've seen AnoHana or Steins;Gate then you'll understand what I mean. 

KyoAni series: Haruhi > Hyouka > Clannad > K-On > the rest. To give you a rough idea of expectations.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is indeed kind of harem-y, with one male raking in chicks by helping them with their problems. It's enjoyable, pretty moe, and gives you intermediate feels. 

However, the second season is much more mature, and deals with the life of the male protagonist beyond high school, and focuses on his relationship with one girl for the most part. The second half of After Story is known as monstrous rollercoaster of emotions, and the feels level is through the roof, which is why it is considered so highly . I without a doubt recommend that you watch the series if you can put aside the art style and generic plot at first. 
>> ARTICLE
Wolf Children and Spirit Away? I feel like anime movies should be in it's own list like most lists when they say the best shows and best movies.

You can think Parasyte is a good anime and still undeserving of Top 25 status.
>> ARTICLE
True enough. Judging by the tone of his message, though, he's obviously not a fan.
>> ARTICLE
The ratings of anime that are still airing are infamously inaccurate. Raters haven't seen the whole show especially the ending (which invariably changes opinions), those people who don't rate shows they haven't completed haven't contributed their opinions and often the sites use different algorithms for determining average ratings while the show is still airing (in particular MAL only counts your rating if you have seen one fifth of the episodes that have been released). Even after long after an anime has finished airing their scores tend to gradually change over time for innumerable reasons.

I would offer the hypothesis that AnimePlanet's Crunchyroll integration is partially to blame for whey the score of Parasyte in particular is so inflated compared to other sites.

Of course that's not to say I think that it should be in a top 25 anime list (at least not so far). But what are you expecting an anime community not to have shit taste?

Depends on how you define Anime.

Anime is animation made in Japan

That's the definition- even this subreddit agrees on that as it's right in the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_everything_posted_here_must_be_anime_related)
>> ARTICLE
I think it is up to someone's interpretation. But to call one side wrong is well, wrong.
>> ARTICLE
That is *a* definition. Not *the* definition. It may be this sub's chosen definition, but it is not the only (nor widely - meaning outside the anime community) accepted one.

Merriam-Webster (somewhat of an authority on language, at least English) states this as it's definition: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime). You will notice that the emphasis is on style - one that originated in Japan - but makes no statement that it cannot be produced outside Japan.

Again, regardless of either of our opinions on the definition of anime, it's silly to say that that is the only definition.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hear any of that, but even if they did at this point, I wouldn't mind it too much. I don't see that as an anime either, but I judge the website for it's overlays, accessibility, ease of access, w/e.

That's an arbitrary reason for losing respect. It's not anime but it's close enough, who cares?

If I had never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime I would not believe that for a second

They are pretty far from being anime, mind I still like some of those cartoons very much on their own merits.

And there are many other reasons I dislike Hummingbird, the fact that they include non-anime is just one of them.
>> ARTICLE
Ah the old anime argument again. I take it you are in the camp that says anime = cartoons from Japan? If so, I present yet again: Le Maison Petit Cubes... (aka Tsumiki no Ie, aka Pieces of Love) an anime which you would probably say was not anime had you "never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime"...

This whole argument is ridiculous tbh, but please do go on and tell me why you think Avatar is not anime while Tsukimi no Ie is.

Top 100
>> ARTICLE
So a lot of people are just talking about how they're behind or whatever.

As someone who as finished the series multiple times, and is keeping up with the manga, I always sort of expected this. Even when I first watched their last episode, a small part of me though, "Oh, is it ending again? I wonder how long it'll last this time." I always hoped it would come back. I wanted to say I always knew, but I doubted. I didn't fully believe. But I hoped. I wished and I dreamed and I pleaded with whatever power I thought could do it for the return of Gintama.

And it's happening. That gorgeous animation. That wonderful OST. Those beautiful OPs and EDs. That flawless voice casting. Those perfectly delivered tsukkomis. Those unparalleled 4th wall obliterations. Everything is coming back.

It is possible that I have never been happier. This is my favorite anime of all time. It has done everything right. And now it gets to continue to do so.

Thank you, TV Tokyo. Thank you, Sorachi Hideaki. Thank you, Gintama. Thank you, /r/anime. I'm just. So. Happy.

I agree with this sentiment. It was canceled because it didn't have enough source material to finish a season. I knew, as long as it was logistically possible (they got all of the voice actors back on) they would bring it back after some more manga built up. The length of the wait got me worried.

I'm hoping that all the material up until now gets adapted, because apparently the most recent arc in the manga is far and away the most important (and best) arc the series has seen thusfar. It would make sense to end the season off on that arc. This would also bring in probably 70-75 episodes worth of material, depending on the pacing. 
>> ARTICLE
The Love Potion arc was relatively recent, so I don't know about that... Give me a second, let me check some stuff.

Okay, let's see here... They left off a little after the Oboro/Sadasada arc, and that was around chapter 400 or so. The Love Potion arc started on chapter 492. So, I doubt we'd see that in one 12- or even 24-episode season, but not to worry, there's still plenty to look forward to!

Honestly, all I need to see is the [Super-fun spoiler](/s "gender-swap arc. I hope they just, like, swap the voice actors they already have around a bit, and then make fun of their staff for being lazy.")

Thanks for the update! Good to know that there is quite a bit of material to work with for the upcoming season.
>> ARTICLE
My pleasure!

And for reference, chapter 523 just came out today, and it was either the last or second-to-last chapter of a VERY big arc, so the anime staff shouldn't be wanting for material to adapt.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go re-read every unadapted chapter to as preparation. At least once more.

Yo a new season as in 20+ episode not ova only? FUCKKK YEAAAAAAAAAAAA

Yup! To be honest, I can see this one getting up to 75 episodes (maybe 100 if they take a small break in-between or add some filler episodes)
>> ARTICLE
You take that back! Gintama has no fillers it's just a roller coaster of awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I'm happy with as many fillers as they can give us, because in Gintama there are no fillers. I'm willing to sit and watch the single background while they all argue about something, and I will be happy.

Filler up with mayo is my saying.

As if I wasn't *already* behind on the entirety of Gintama! :P
>> ARTICLE
This depends on your viewing habits, but I'd say don't pressure yourself to catch up quickly if you feel inclined to. I get the most enjoyment from the show on an episode-a-day basis, usually after work or class to unwind and/or kick off the evening.

That being said, apparently it's not uncommon for people to binge it which sounds crazy to me.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Gintama during summer vacation over the course of 2 weeks and a fuckload of weed
>> ARTICLE
I wish I could've limited myself to one ep a day. I started watching it a few weeks before my final high school exams. I didn't get much studying done.
>> ARTICLE
Yea that's pretty much what I've been doing, I watch a couple episodes before going to sleep as something less serious than some of the stuff I've been watching.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. I might be unfairly constraining my recommendation there as far as time of day goes.  
>> ARTICLE
I had to binge through it because it was just too enjoyable. I couldn't get myself to take breaks. It's truly the greatest anime in existence to me, and I am beyond excited that it's getting a new season. Like literally, I'm shivering. 
>> ARTICLE
Well with that in mind, surely this calls for a [celebration](http://i.imgur.com/ATW0qCX.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
I end up watching it whenever I have an excuse to sit still for 20+ minutes. After work? Gintama. No work? Smoke and Gintama. At a friends house? Sm4sh and Gintama. Going to bed? Let's go sweet dream otherside.
>> ARTICLE
Tommy heavenly6 <3 that was such a charming song and OP.

Be sure to recruit your friends with Gintama as well!

Gintama has really great OPs and EDs

Hey man, sometimes I just need to laugh until I can't breathe.

Can't really argue there.

Idea: Gintama + alcohol. I feel like the absurdity and drunkenness would work pretty well together.

I need to try that. I like the way you think.

But be careful not to blackout or you may have to marry 5+ people separately.

Checking this subreddit one more time before going to bed just made me really happy.

**AWW YEA NIGGA! FUCK YES!! THIS IS THE BEST PRESENT EVER!!!!MY BODY IS READY!**
>> ARTICLE
Its about time for me to get into Gintama. Action comedies have been my favorite (and Gintama seems to be at the top of the genre) but that 200 plus episodes is a big commitment for a binge watcher like myself to tackle.
>> ARTICLE
Yes yes yes. After Gintama I was absolutely hard-pressed to find something else to fill my action comedy void.
>> ARTICLE
Remember however that Gintama is comedy first. There's like one big action arc every 40 or so episodes, and these usually last about 6-8 episodes max. They are awesome, no doubt, but they're not what the show's about. There was a guy on /r/anime a while ago who wrote that he skipped all the comedy episodes and only watched the action arcs which is just incredibly stupid! It's like skipping the dialogs in -Monogatari, skipping the fights in Attack on Titan, or skipping the lesbians in Sakura Trick.
>> ARTICLE
>Skipping the lesbians in Sakura Trick.

I think that's less like skipping the comedy in Gintama and more like skipping ninjas in Naruto.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, then it's like skipping the lesbian kissing.
>> ARTICLE
>Its about time for me to get into Gintama

This is always correct

Also, if you enjoy action comedies, I would not be surprised if Gintama will be your favorite series ever, by a significant margin. 
>> ARTICLE
Just curious, but is there enough source material?
>> ARTICLE
YESSSSSSS

right. Time to catch up
>> ARTICLE
GET HYPED
>> ARTICLE
Yes only about 90 episodes in so I have some catching up to do now, I'm excited
>> ARTICLE
Awww yeah, I started watching Gintama about month ago and now I'm at episode 119 and I'm loving it! Good to know that fun isn't ending anytime soon, although I have planned to start reading manga also.
>> ARTICLE
About damn time, based cyborg-Sorachi.

YES YES I have been holding off on the manga.  I hope it's a long season.  I marathoned it all over last summer.

Thats a great news indeed, but I would like them to finish Sket dance too :(

A fucking dream come true. Ive been having dreams about shogun the last week ffs.

So we don't need a t-t-t-time machine after all. 
>> ARTICLE
I just started this series a couple days ago because of all the praise it gets on this sub, and I am in love with it now, All ive got to do now is watch 200 something episodes before springtime. RIP second semester grades.
>> ARTICLE
OMG I just watched the episode (#153) late last night where Kagura couldn't sleep and they ran that "sad story" segment.

Fucking LOL

I had to pause to finish laughing. So glad to see this back on. 
>> ARTICLE
I should start the anime. I read the first 20-30 chapters, it was alright. But i heard anime is better.
>> ARTICLE
The first dozen chapters of manga AND episodes of anime are very introductory. For the most part, they all introduce anywhere from recurring-to-obscure characters that'll pop back in and out with their own associating gags/running jokes/etc.

I agree that the comedic timing, facilitated with the addition of animation and sound adds to the experience though.
>> ARTICLE
It's one of those series where the anime truly outshines the manga. However, either way, it is generally agreed upon that the beginning of the series is not as enjoyable as the rest. You need to get through the first ~25 episodes to truly appreciate the characters, and once you do so, it kicks into high gear and just gets better, and better, and better...
>> ARTICLE
The anime is waaaaaay better. Some of the best voice acting period, great soundtrack and the animation fits the show incredibly well. The first ~20 episodes are great, but the next 200 are awesome!
>> ARTICLE
What about the last 45? :p
>> ARTICLE
Question is there any place which lists the things Gintama references by episode ? 
>> ARTICLE
Yessssss woop woopppp
>> ARTICLE
YES! i wonder how many episodes.

Manga readers, how many serious arcs are there after the previous season?
>> ARTICLE
About 2-3 serious arcs if I remember correctly, one of them being a major arc about Gintoki's past. 
>> ARTICLE
There are 13 bigger or smaller arcs not yet animated
>> ARTICLE
If you have time to think of a beautiful end, live beautifully right until that end.

welp, I have 265? episodes to catch up on...

Plus the OVAs and the second movie.

The upcoming OVA is the REAL cancelled lost eighth episode from Gintama 2011.

And the manga:

* topless Catherine in first Shogun arc
* Tendoshu in Sadaharu vs Mass Media arc
* cut scenes from ep 239 about how Gintama is as fast as a ninja, as well as jabs towards real-life laws
* and even more...

And the audio CDs and games are original content and hilarious too.

Lucky guy, you have an amazing 265 eps of first-time Gintama experience ahead of you. If possible I would erased my memory and watched it again

Time for another Gintama show to take over the top list on MAL. Rather than shows that actually deserve it.
>> ARTICLE
[Uh no.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/650/535/cdb.gif)
>> ARTICLE
And what's yours shitposter?
>> ARTICLE
Gintama rightly deserves to be in everyone's top 10 lists. How many other animes out there manage to perfectly blend great comedy with superb action?

Sure, it takes awhile to get into the series (you'll have to trudge through the first 12-15 episodes which serve to introduce the characters), but once you're in, it instantly becomes addicting. 
>> ARTICLE
Literally there are 4 Gintama shows in the top 10, and it takes over spots that can be filled by Gurren Lagann, Code Geass, Mushishi, Fate/Zero, etc. It's a comedy show with little to no plot. People can like it but it should never be a top show. I hate it so much.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Nah when Gintama is a top 10 show you know anime is dying.
>> ARTICLE
You've just exposed yourself as someone who hasn't actually watched or read the series. It's more than just a 'comedy show'. There IS an interesting plot, and the main characters' have backgrounds/pasts that are slowly being revealed as the series goes on. (Gintoki and the Amanto war, the Kihetai, etc). 

There's a reason most people have it in their top 10 lists, and the show's 'comedy' isn't the only thing keeping the series in there. As aforementioned, the show manages to successfully blend drama, action with comedy. How many other animes do that?


>> ARTICLE
Oh I've watched enough to know that it's generic and like every other parody, "action", comedy out there. Background stories and pasts are in every good anime, there is nothing special about it. I would be okay with the show if it didn't leech so many of the top 10 spaces on MAL. It's so mindlessly easy to make a show like that and people love it, it's ridiculous. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not an anime popularity contest. It's fine not to like it, but hating it because other people like it is just stupid.

It's a long anime with a lot of really unique arcs. Whether you got to that or not is not my concern. You're welcome to dislike it. But stop trying to make others feel bad for liking it.
>> ARTICLE
It's one of the best animes out there, that's why it's where it is, because it belongs on top of Code Geass and the others.
>> ARTICLE
Its a comedy show with little to no plot and nothing else that special, now why is it one of the best?
>> ARTICLE
Because it has a special type of life that other animes can't replicate. That's why it's loved as much as it is. If it was easy to describe, everyone would be doing it, but it's not.. Not many animes out there could keep you watching a still picture for 15 minutes while the characters repeat lines from a prior episode.
>> ARTICLE
Katsura literally toppled the Bakufu.

Stupid dumb Katsura, I love you.

On a side note, I think every single character in Gintama has the perfect voice actor!
>> ARTICLE
After so many episodes it gets really hard to imagine any other voices for people, especially Gintoki. There's a reason that Sunrise pays the big bucks for A-list voice actors, though.
>> ARTICLE
The only problem is when you hear them in other shows and you can't unhear Gin or Shinpachi...
>> ARTICLE
Wait, is that a bad thing?
>> ARTICLE
Haha no, just a little distracting sometimes.  For example, when I started watching Hyouka, the second Fukube opened his mouth I knew it was Shinpachi's VA. 
>> ARTICLE
For me, it's really weird hearing all the secondary characters' voices since Sunrise hires really fucking big names for them. Like Otose, her husband, Matsudaira, Kameyama (the turtle assassin), Daigoro, or Abuto. 

Specifically Abuto, as watching episode 142 and hearing Tora from *Toradora* and Jiraiya from *Naruto* beat the shit out of each other is bizarre.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Eva for the first time last week and I could not take Gendo seriously because Hasegawa. 
>> ARTICLE
Ya know, it's pretty jarring when you go from the long awaited meeting between insane-san and batshit crazy-kun to people talking about tissue box and toilet paper mutations.

*I still don't know what a fucking patriot is.*
>> ARTICLE
I love the style of the Kyubei picture in the fanart corner. Plus Kamui & Kagura as kids is just adorable.

**Episode 215**  Nice (or maybe not) to see what happened to Princess Kada after the Four Devas arc. I like the game console analogy used by Kamui and Abuto. Was I the only one paying more attention to the cowman behind Admiral Aho everytime the camera went to the Admiral? Kamui vs Takasugi? [Thats quite the mouthful.](http://i.imgur.com/ZxwZ7ig.png) [ITS A TRAP!](http://i.imgur.com/3LZIv1P.png) Was I the only one who thought of [Cowboy Bebop here?](http://i.imgur.com/N2WdHKK.png) Breakout! Kamui with that fly kick against the admirals shuttle. So now we have the two main antagonists working together. Thisll heat things up the next time they return. The new ED is quite interesting, Id need to listen to it a few more times before I decide whether I really like it or not.
*****
**Episode 216**  A tour of the Odd Jobs in action? I wonder if that would really be a good idea for kids. Hey, its Daigorou! Strategist/Supreme Commander of Eastern Operations Strategos . Im putting that down on my resume. That indentation is otherwise known as the [Philtrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philtrum). Daigorou becoming hard-boiled. Feel [the](http://i.imgur.com/gIa72Un.png) [burn!](http://i.imgur.com/2DAMwSL.png). Hijikata endorsing the Patriot now. Tsukuyo no! Hasegawa taking the Patriot to the next level. At [this point](http://i.imgur.com/f2RuYU6.png) I lost it. They are really keeping this Patriot joke going huh? [Yeah, thats what Gintama does best kid](http://i.imgur.com/onHsfrl.png) Everyones getting shot this episode! From fried chicken to tissue boxes and toilet paper on a stick. Going through life on a conveyor belt. That final kick was how I expected it to end, not that its a bad thing since it was still great.
*****
**Episode 217**  Did Shinpachi eat the experimental chewing gum like Violet did from Willy Wonkas chocolate factory? Way to scare everyone off Gin! Hasegawa, you shouldve learned from past experience never to ask the Yorozuya to help out with jobs. Tsukuyo rocking that bikini. [Stupid sexy Katsura.](http://i.imgur.com/W80hmuU.png) Embarrassed Kyubei is cute. [More sexy Katsura!](http://i.imgur.com/Rxiq08a.png) Now it can only get funnier. I like how [derpy Gins face is here.](http://i.imgur.com/SYwa05C.png) Now the Shogun arrives!? This can only get better. The tip jokes are out in force today. Im surprised the Shogun didnt faint from the blood loss. Those are some strong briefs. That was crazy. Then of course Katsura jumps in with an ironic line to end it all.
*****
**Episode 218**  This episodes running gag, crabs! [Nice call back to episode 25.](http://i.imgur.com/O5zhvAT.png) Damn you Sorachi and your one shots! Step it up Shinpachi! [Face of a mastermind.](http://i.imgur.com/WcgX7XR.png) This is just like episode 25 all over again. Fighting to see who will become the Crabqueror. These are some pretty [funny looking castles.](http://i.imgur.com/po7EbRb.png) Kagura bringing the power of eggs to the table! Balse appetite? First time Ive heard of that. Of course it tasted horrible, what did you expect?
*****
**Episode 219**  That scammer got smashed by Kagura and now Kaguras helping him out. Of course Gins the first person she thinks of. (These cold fish](http://i.imgur.com/j80XAxF.png) [eyes](http://i.imgur.com/H3v9fF8.png) remind me of Oregairus main character. NO! NOT THE NES CARTRIDGE! Katsura as per usual coming up with excellent plans. Takeshi really gets around apparently. [ANPAN!](http://i.imgur.com/fMfYgx0.png) [Easy now with the pervert face](http://i.imgur.com/BkIw77Z.png) I just noticed that [Sadaharu was on the NES cartridge](http://i.imgur.com/vxqqCFO.png) Kagura, dont complain about the price. [This would get some funny looks out of context.](http://i.imgur.com/oTt6bRg.png) Hedoros back and he brought the family!  
*****
**Episode 220**  A tap in a spa? Is that even a thing? I like how they can talk and understand each other underwater. Well there goes Kondo. The slime, it burns! Now going with the renowned Face meets Wall technique. Using the family members as weapons now. Seems Kondo is getting a lot of things [injected into his ass](http://i.imgur.com/T5R7Zwb.png) this episode. [Just when I thought Id recovered from laughing.](http://i.imgur.com/FuR9tTn.png) I wonder what the women have been doing this entire time. Sougo you almost made it! I like how [they use the ED like this.](http://i.imgur.com/TRI6viu.png) 
*****
**Episode 221**  Training a monkey to become a warrior and a celebrity. The second part would be easier I imagine. Gin rubbing his poo-covered head on Kaguras sleeve was cute. So now we have to call the monkey. We need to shorten the name. Theres no way I am typing out that full name which is a paragraph long everytime I want to refer to the monkey. I have to wonder how many attempts it took everyone to nail get that name in a single breath. The subtitle font keeps changing a lot and it bugs me since its a little smaller.

[The song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te7LKD5eSu0) that was playing during the montage of Kyubei taking care of the monkey was really nice, I hope we get to hear it again. Since when are monkey asses cute looking in anime? I can probably guess how this story will continue, but well see how Gintama twists it. I really like that they keep [doing this with the ED.](http://i.imgur.com/nNOj7MK.png) 
*****
**Episode 222**  Keep using that song please! Kagura with her [amazing drawing never fails to impress.](http://i.imgur.com/Xoip2Yn.png) I love how their magic chant was song lyrics. That is one damn smart monkey. You shouldve shortened that name. Everytime I see [this word](http://i.imgur.com/qocdrRT.png) I read it in [this guys voice.](http://i.imgur.com/5W9He9Z.gifv) Wait, Balmung and Isaac are real? Even Hasegawa is getting in on the shit throwing, must be revenge for all the times he was screwed over. This ended how I expected it to but Gintama being Gintama there was a number of silly things thrown in to mix it up a bit. Ginpachi-sensei! There really are a lot of technicalities with kanji, huh?

The last time I had laughed that hard was when the shinsengumi was trying to negotiate with the alien at the airport and when katsura? ripped that alien's ear when he was undercover.  
  
After the move when the group watch end - there should definitely be a poll for best arc serious and non-serious etc

**Ep. 215** - Oh, Kada ended up in a very bad place. She's either been tortured into insanity or cracked for some other reason. Kamui and Abuto, back with the Harusame?Time for a villain episode!

Turns out it wasn't a trap for Takasugi, but rather Kamui? Can't say I'm surprised, he was a bigger threat to the admiral rather than the Kiheitai ever were. Besides, Takasugi's already been promised as the end villain for Gintoki,remember episode 150? Can't have him knocked offjust yet.

Dangerous to let them talk to each other, they might get the bright idea to team up. [You're gonna carry that weight.](http://i.imgur.com/Svq9ysk.png) Yep, villain team up to take over the Harusame. I like those. Does this mean Kamui's in charge of the entire fleet now? That can't be good for Odd Jobs. Mmm, villain episode.

**Ep. 216** - Why does Kagura even know these kids? She's older than all of them. Nice job playing along, Shinpachi. I always like seeing Gin in a beard, but what the hell is he working on? A Patriot, okay, good improvising but you really should have thought further ahead about what its purpose is.Daigoro calls them on their bullshit, which I approve of. The kid likes bourbon, really? Oh right, Hasegawa must have gotten to him.

Man, these kids are rough. [Dammit, Sacchan.](http://i.imgur.com/UzQyiQ7.png) Why are the rest of the adults using Patriots too? Nice job with the chocolate factory rip-off, and again a kid calls them on it (not Daigoro for once). That's a... dramatic way to get the kids in the building. I like Gin's change to just a mustache too, it goes better with the cap.

I'll admit, the whole conveyor belt history almost got to me. However, [I'm with the kids.](http://i.imgur.com/2QXvzXq.png)

**Ep. 217 (flashback)** - Oooh, I forgot this episode was this week. This is a Very Special Episode of Gintama for me, as it's the first one Ieverwatched. A few months before this discussion group started (i.e. back in February/March last year) people were talking about the show in a chat and suggested this episode specifically, so I gave it a try. An approximation of my thoughts from the first time:

I don't know any of the characters.It makes no sense, I have no idea why there is a giant bird... thing at the pool, I don't know why the silver-haired guy is constantly being assaulted or why people are shouting so much. There are not one but three stalkers (the one with lavender hair and glasses is kinda cute though), and apparently the shogun(?!) is here only to have his dignity and underwear stretched to unbelievable ends. The humor's lewd and crude and not at all mystyle. It may be popular but it's not for me.

After my initial impression from this episode,I only begrudgingly started watching when the discussion group began. That said...

---
**Ep. 217(now)** - A pool episode, time for swimsuits! Coincidentally I watched the swimsuit episode of Sakura Trick earlier in the day, now I wish it was summer.

Saw Daigoro at the beginning there. Gin's on lifeguard duty? This isn't going to end well... why is Shinpachi purple? Well, it scared off the kids at least. Wait, *Hasegawa* got the job? Why on Earth did he recruit Odd Jobs to help him out? Heh, Shinpachi has an Otsu-brand beach ball, nice touch. Hasegawa has a good point, Shinpachi's normally the straight man here.

Hnnngh, best girl in a swimsuit. Always has a kunai on hand too. Good to see Seita having fun, though this is definitely not like Yoshiwara. ...I'm not sure I want to know why the stool is censored. Nice landing too.

Katsura, just as crazy as ever. The watermelon can't get *that* cold in the pool. Uh oh, Kyubei and Otae. I thought Otae had a larger chest than that? Certainly larger than Kyubei at least. Aww, poor Kyubei. She's certainly enjoying burying herself in Otae's chest there and I don't blame her.

Wait, here come the stalkersand of course they have underwatercameras. Kondofirst, Tojowas unexpected for me but makes sense, and then of course Sacchan. ...Katsura, how are you spearfishing in a public pool?

Gin has a good point, now that all the kids are gone they don't have to do anything since all that's left are regulars that can take care of themselves. No Gintama, you aren't allowed to take a week off. Why, Gin, why are you pouring strawberry milk into the pool? You can't drink it that way.

Matsudaira is having none of their shit, but fortunately the shogun is fairly lenient. I like the rising sun background. Sho-chan, eh? That's... casual. Nice brief grid of all the abuse he's been subjected to before, time to add to the list.

"10th and 14th shouldn't be so stingy!" I don't get it, and no translator notes to help out. [Love the shot of the five ladies in the pool.](http://i.imgur.com/9xEIeGf.png) Sho-chan, please stop leaking. Sacchan, you don't have to worry about getting pregnant with anyone's baby, much less Gin's.

Gin still wants to see some boobs (ostensibly for the shogun's sake), so time for some fun.Is that Taka-tin with Elizabeth's raft? AlsoHedoro with Sadaharu, nice job pulling in random characters forthis shot. Kagura has a good point, all of the ladies are stronger than the guys here aside from Gin himself.

"You'll never see a more noble wedgie in your lifetime." Wise words, Gin. Love Seita planting a flag in the shogun's ass (also a sentence Inever thought I'd type). [Kyubei's blushing reaction](http://i.imgur.com/5ITbkd6.png) is very cute and tempting me away from Tsukuyo with her twin-tails.

Then it just gets weird (well, not that weird by Gintama's standards) with the four guys fighting over the shogun's underwear. He is not a man to be messed with, however.

---
**Ep. 218** - Crab! Coincidentally I watched the first two episodes of Bakemonogatari earlier. [Crab God](http://i.imgur.com/6oHvfD3.png) scuttling back and forth is hilarious.

A blackout? Gin is quick to call the animators lazy as I was expecting but it's apparently the manga author's fault. Uh oh, a crab leg went missing but it looks like Gin's the obvious culprit. Another blackout, another missing leg and this time it's Kagura.

[I like the candle lighting.](http://i.imgur.com/LYSu9Mu.png) Wow, they're brazen about it this time. Poor Shinpachi. This is reminding me of the sukiyaki battle way back in episode 25 and I'm loving it, though this time it's expressed as an assault on a castle and I'm fine with that.

Good for Shinpachi to turn the tables on Gin, and Kagura goes all Laputa on us (I still haven't seen Castle in the Sky), but Shinpachi still got screwed overall.

>  You're gonna carry that weight.

Guess I wasn't the only one who thought of Bebop huh.

> Ep. 217 (flashback)

The first thing I ever saw for Gintama was a GIF of the Four Devas arc when Gin goes beserk against Jirouchou in the cemetary and when I started watching it I thought to myself "So...this isn't a serious show? Was that a parody or something?"

> "10th and 14th shouldn't be so stingy!" 

Isn't that a reference to the Popularity Poll?

>  Love Seita planting a flag in the shogun's ass

Only in Gintama would you ever see a line like this and it not be a metaphor for anything.

**Ep. 219** - Dude earns money as a punching bag? He picked the wrong neighborhood to visit. Time for the parade of crazies from Kabukicho! While Kagura would be a funny end ("finally, after all these ridiculous people, a little girl that can't hurt--nope") she's also a good lead to set expectations.

She basically gives him a tour of the town and shows off the ridiculous main cast, as expected. Poor Takeshi never gets anything back, including a resurrection scroll? I'm a little annoyed by Yamazaki becoming Flanderized with his obsession over anpan.

[This would make me want to run away too.](http://i.imgur.com/I5Yb1IQ.png)

**Ep. 220** -Betweenthis and the pool episode there's a lot of shirtless people this week. Good to see Hedoro again, and he brought his family along this time! I have no idea why the humans are playing along here, they should just politely excuse themselves *and leave*. Granted, if I was in their situation I'd be too terrified to do that too.

Kondo somehow got himself wrapped around dad's dick. Why am I not surprised? The rest of the episode is utterly ridiculous but not really my kind of humor, so I don't have a lot to say about it. I do likeHijikata and Sougo [fighting with two of thebrothers](http://i.imgur.com/3cF0OiI.png) though.

Of course dad hated the experience, but at least Hedoro made some friends! [And they can't show enough of Kondo, can they?](http://i.imgur.com/NBvQmcA.png) I noticed the fade in to the credits so I actually paid attention this time and saw [Kondo with dad](http://i.imgur.com/bMYqKMx.png) toward the end! Did they do this with the earlier episodes and I just missed it?

---
**Ep. 221** - A Kyubei episode, yessss. She has to train a monkey? This should be fun and involve a lot of shit slinging, and we get started on the latter early with Gin being a high priority target.

Jugem, eh? Not a bad name. Everyone else is quick to come up with more ridiculous suggestions, but I hope the first one sticks (no pun intended). I do like Kagura's Balmung Fezalion, though, along with his backstory (and attack combos). If only his father wasn't named Runny Diarrhea.

I'm more amused that Otae runs with the theme and comes up with Issac Schneider, but that name sounds more appropriate for a movie star than a pet. Granted, the monkey's going to be a celebrity so maybe that's fitting. I want to play a fighting-card game, does anything like that exist? And that's how B'z was started.

So Kyubei came up with his full name: [Jugem Jugem Shit-Tossing the](http://i.imgur.com/bCS50p7.png) [Life of Shin-chan's Two-Day-Old Underwear](http://i.imgur.com/cUTfGil.png) [Balmung Fezalion Issac Schneider](http://i.imgur.com/G5tCYSs.png) [1/3 True Love 2/3 Hangnail Anxiety](http://i.imgur.com/PE1XkFb.png) [Betrayal Knows My Name Or Does It Really](http://i.imgur.com/QFk4u7Z.png) [Ignore Calls Squid Dogfish Halibut Trout Cod Dogfish](http://i.imgur.com/XrCtPPh.png) [This Is a Different Dogfish, I'm Talking About The Dogfish Shark](http://i.imgur.com/0Zwc2sJ.png) [Kaluga Angler Ray](http://i.imgur.com/ouQoGEs.png) [Yuuteimiyaoukimukou Pepepepepepepepepepepepe](http://i.imgur.com/iDMs1lO.png) [Runny Diarrhea.](http://i.imgur.com/RfMj1vV.png) ^(RIP RES users.)

And for some stupid reason it just gets funnier to me every time someone says his full name after that. I love [Shinpachi's reactions](http://i.imgur.com/TqRx3Y5.png) for one of those times. [Nice](http://i.imgur.com/uBWCgSq.png) [eyecatches](http://i.imgur.com/PB2M7Lu.png)to start, and then I absolutely love the music playing during the training montage.

Tojo's unhappy with the situation, but [I'm a fan.](http://i.imgur.com/wbnVMso.png) Alas, all good things must come to an end and so Jugem Jugem must go to the noble's kid. But first, [hnnngh](http://i.imgur.com/UGrxVGW.png) [Kyubei's so cute.](http://i.imgur.com/7XCUUp3.png)

And [they're continuing with the credits thing!](http://i.imgur.com/NEudUuE.png) I'm guessing I just missed it when the new ED started.

---
**Ep. 222** - It's weird that when I saw the kid in the bath with all of his toys, my only thought was [why does he have a super soaker? They haven't been invented yet.](http://i.imgur.com/ee0mZTJ.png) Apparently my suspension of disbelief in the show's anachronistic tendencies fails entirely for certain objects.

Of course the monkey is not happy with the kid and escapes, so time to comb the city in search of him! As soon as I saw Kyubei leave home I *knew* that would be the first place Jugem Jugem would visit, because that's how these tropes work.

[Kagura hasn't given up on Balmung Fezalion](http://i.imgur.com/5doI0xb.png) and I'm with her on that. Didn't expect her story to go on quite that long but I like it. Gin's good bait for this, hope he gets paid well. Tojo actually has money too.Whoops, *all* of the monkeys are out. Gin should be getting paid extra for all the shit that's getting flung his way.

I like the couple of DBZ references they toss inwith the noble kid naming the monkey Goku and Tojo asking if Gin is [related to Frieza.](http://i.imgur.com/H40ieie.png) Don't get the crab thing though, is that a mythology reference?

Somehow Katsura findsBalmung. With a bell on his neck. Hasegawa brings Issac. [And then they all throw shit at Gin.](http://i.imgur.com/shteBZo.png) At least that gets all of the monkeys there and they find the right one. Fortunately the kid's smart enough to realize the monkey belongs with Kyubei, who makes a slight addition to his name.

And so ends the tale ofJugem Jugem Shit-Tossing the Life of Shin-chan's Two-Day-Old Underwear Balmung Fezalion Issac Schneider 1/3 True Love 2/3 Hangnail Anxiety Betrayal Knows My Name Or Does It Really Ignore Calls Squid Dogfish Halibut Trout Cod Dogfish This Is a Different Dogfish, I'm Talking About The Dogfish Shark Kaluga Angler Ray Yuuteimiyaoukimukou Pepepepepepepepepepepepe [All's Well That Ends Well Runny Diarrhea.](http://i.imgur.com/fizSsEn.png)

Oh, and [more shit-tossing in the ending.](http://i.imgur.com/vo46oxa.png) I enjoyed the couple of Ginpachi-sensei remarks about guest VAs getting certain words wrong, fun to get behind the scenes bits like that.

---
So a few weak (in my opinion) standalone episodes this week, but it opened and closed on high notes. While Tsukuyo tookthebest girl ranking with the Red Spider arc, I've always said Kyubei needed more time and this is proof of it. Between her being very cute at the pool and the Jugem arc, it's now a tossup between the two of them for which one's my favorite. Sacchan's still a close third after her glasses story last week and just generally getting more screen time recently.

The song that plays during Jugem's episodes were actually just his name sung out nicely XD. You can hear the first two "Jugem"s and the "Pepepep..." towards the end.

> You're complaining about that when there's TV's, mobile phones and computers?

Never said it made any sense.

For everybody who didn't get the references:

* The ridiculous long name and the Jugem is a reference to an old Japanese folktale called [Jugemu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugemu), with the main character's name being "Jugemu Jugemu Gok-no surikire Kaijarisuigyo-no Suigymatsu Unraimatsu Fraimatsu Kuunerutokoro-ni Sumutokoro Yaburakji-no burakji Paipopaipo Paipo-no-shringan Shringan-no Grindai Grindai-no Ponpokop-no Ponpokon-no Chkymei-no Chsuke". There are many references to that name in anime, my favorite being the [ED of the anime Joshiraku](http://vimeo.com/45536419) (an anime that very heavily references Japanese culture and therefore unfortunately doesn't really work for us uncultured gaijins).

* "Ignore Calls Squid Dogfish Halibut Trout Cod Dogfish", or in Japanese "Rusu Surume Medaka Kazuno Kokoedame Medaka" is a game of [Shiritori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiritori). Since you aren't allowed to use the same word twice, the next part is an explanation that whoever came up with it didn't mean the actual "Medaka", but instead [Ikeno Medaka](http://asianwiki.com/Medaka_Ikeno), an actor.

* "Yuuteimiyaoukimukou Pepepepepepepepepepepepe", as Shinpachi said, is a reference to the "Spell of Resurrection", the saving system in the early Dragon Quest games. Since they didn't have a battery to save your progress, the player was given a long string of letters that contained the player's progression (similar to how in some video games with character creators these days (Mass Effect 2 for example) you can turn your character into a code that, when entered into the creator again, creates the character you created before).

**Ep. 215**  Weve lost space pirate peacock princess, guys. Squad 7 and the Kiheitai in the same place. Can you feel the hype? Does the heart good to see Kamui overeat like other Yato. I know Im too easy to please when Admiral Asshole gets a laugh out of me.
	
> Are we moving forward right now?

  I swear Takasugi speaks in metaphors and profundities. What in the actual hell are you rambling about Oishi? I am so ready for villain-on-villain battle. Wait, so the Amanto preemptively quashed an uprising against Asshole? Yeah, Kamui is a bit scary. Ooh, they have a common desire of constant evolution to obtain greater and greater power. And theres the recruitment tied back into the moving forward speech from earlier. Squad 7s mutiny made quite the mess of Kamuis execution. *Naniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii*?!? Dang, they baited a future fight between the two final bosses. I sense a disturbance in the next popularity poll.

*****

**Ep. 216**  Gura needs the spotlight every now and then. Sup Daigoro? B-line to the roleplay. Im barely following whats being said, but thank you Daigoro for curtailing it. Youre so hardu-boiledo. Aw, dont be dejected, Gin. 

Round 2: Hijikata  philosophical questions are not his strong suit. Sulk over the Patriot.

Round 3: Tsukky! Sacchan, get away from Best Girl. Tsukkys idea of intimacy shouldnt be express-able with a Patriot. 

Round 4: Poor kids. They shouldnt have to seewhatever that was.

Regrouping: Why is everyone so invested in impressing the kids?

Uh: NASA, the FBI, and the NBA. I cant. I barely even know what Im watching.

> He was born broken

Things you shouldnt say to children, though Kagura is enough of a child to get away with it. The theatrics undergone just to get a little respect out of random kids. Heh, they added Patriot angel Hasegawa in the ED.
	
*****

**Ep. 217**  Pool episode! Need I say more? Hogging the pool to yourselves AND roleplaying to accomplish it. Two birds. Did Tsukky manage to curve her kunai or something?

> Sit down on this stool and spread your legs

Getting straight to the point today. Katsura was born for that hair flip. When one stalker appears at least one more will follow. How does that swimsuit yank even happen? Look at the lengths Katsura is going for attention. Drat, I was excited for paradise. Shoguns here, let the suffering commence. Sacchan is *still* salty over the popularity poll. I swear the next few minutes are constant, desperate attempts at raciness. Gin should know by now that the fanservice scale is heavily tipped against his favor in his show.

~~Gin x Otae~~. Kagura knows whats up. Obligatory naked Shogun. Katsura unintentionally toppling the Bafuku, what an oblivious champ.

**Ep. 218**  Things to avoid: expecting Odd Jobs to be civil when a delicacy is involved. Gins screwball ramblings only get weirder. 

*Blackout #1* - I mean, it definitely *looked* like a lot of resources were pooled into the Four Devas Arc. I hope Gins throat didnt get pierced in his desperate act.

*Blackout #2* - Geeze Kagura, how clumsy are you? When cornered, go for the tenderest areas. Oh boy, plotting and mind games incoming. 

*Blackout #3* - Dont fall for it, Shinpachi! Sigh, how did he not see that misdirection? You deserve the loss. Get shamed! 

*Sukiyaki Showdown: Crab Edition* - Confession: I ate somewhat kosher growing up so all of the crab talk is foreign to me. Princess Crab-Paste? Im not sorry for not eating crab. Lesson learned: take out China Girl before anyone else. BRB doing research on the Sengoku period because TL Notes is kill. Yup, there goes Kagura swooping in to take advantage of the in-fighting. Ill take the shows advice and go for imitation if Im feeling adventurous.

*****

**Ep. 219.0**  The service everyone needs. And theres Kagura on cue. Give her food. Unlock her helpful side.

*Weak & Irritated*

> Most of them come here to bitch about their lives

Kaguras views of the adult world amuse me to no end. Gin should know better when hanging out with Hasegawa. *Crush crush crush*. You cant re-gift a gift in front of the gift-er!

*Friendly & Energetic* - Better plan: remove the toilet paper. See episode 79. I love how the entire faction acknowledges Kagura as their leader. No hesitation with the slapping. A major sacrifice on ~~Takeshis~~ Katsuras part. Takeshi gets around. 

 I feel bad for the guy. He must be terrified of the Shinsengumi. RPs well with Okita though. Nice to know that Takeshi is diversifying his services. Sticking with the anpan gag, Yamazaki?

**Ep. 220**  Emergency iceberg. Its a great day for reaction faces. Amazing underwater talking skills. Was going to make a remark about Gin knowing Kondos size but at least 15% of Kondos screen time lacks pants. Oh god why isnt his scrotum censored?!? [Biagra Spring]( https://i.imgur.com/yFyarIf.gif ). All hope is lost again. Run. Just run. The situation is not salvageable. [Deserved punishment](http://i.imgur.com/PJQA5Jt.gif). What bathhouses *do* you frequent, Gin? Probably the same ones Tsukky alludes to. Hijikata gets stuck with being the *tsukkomi* in the worst situations. So much horn and ass play. Might be difficult to retain friendship when they forget about Hederos gentle nature after encountering him. Lost it when Okita slipped into the pyramid of buckets.

Wow that was a 20-minute George Costanza moment I had to watch through the gaps of my fingers.

**Ep. 221**  Shoguns have traditionally asked favors of the Yagyu clan regarding monkeys. [Was wondering why Koshinori reminded me of Russian sushi](http://myanimelist.net/character/27889/Brezhnev_Semyon). A booger is one thing. Wiping shit on Kagura cant be attributed to the father-daughter dynamic, Gin. Seriously, is Jugem reaching into some pocket of space filled to the brim with feces? There has to be a name for the effect of purposefully mismatching a song against the mood. The scrolling red Kanji, I cant. These voice actors are troopers. [Humanity Has Declined Ep 2](/s "For some reason the monkey montage reminded me of Ave Maria playing over the suicidal chickens. Probably that same pattern of humor in song selection.") Hopeless Tojo should give up. Get a new gag. Look at Yamazaki! Anpan is working wonders for him. I blinked and the story ended. Lol this arc getting two parts.

*****

**Ep. 222**  Lol this arc getting recap. Realized the song is just vocalizing Jegums name. How did Kyuubeis VA not murder Sorachi? Can we derail into Fezalion & Schneider territory? I dont even need Jugem. *Hey hey give me your body!* Gin protesting the role of the shit receptacle while pushing Tojos face into one. Get it over with. Cant escape it now. Barraged! Lost it during the phone calls fumbling over Jegums name. Everyone gained access to Jecums pocket dimension. Look at Kagura fangirl over Fezalion & Schneider! I blinked again and the story ended. 

Ginpachi-sensei! Heh, Okita-kun love pudding. Daw, the show should depict the VAs in a more complimenting light since they owned Jegums name like champs.

Alas. Not like that was going to happen anyway, it's not that kind of show.

Yeah, I just kinda glossed over the historical bits of that one. I have to say if I ever actually learn about Japanese history my mental images of the figures are going to be hilarious.

> Takasugi had maybe a couple of appearances (including the Benizakura arc) and the dude was still number 4.

Well he has an eyepatch so that adds a sense of mystery (Although by this point we kinda know what happened) and he speaks in metaphors all the time, so he comes off as intelligent and everyone loves mysterious intelligent villains.
>> ARTICLE
It has to be because he is Final Boss. What I want to figure out is how Sakamoto has such high favor.
>> ARTICLE
> What I want to figure out is how Sakamoto has such high favor.

Yeah, that really made no sense to me. We've barely saw him throughout the entire show yet he still gets a decent rating.
>> ARTICLE
Sakamoto has high favor for a few reasons:

First, he's one of the characters that's based on a real person ("I was in the Taiga drama over the summer! AHAHAHAHA!"); it has the appeal of seeing someone significant you'd know from your high school history class being paraded around like an idiot. 

Second, the whole Anti-Foreigner War thing. 

Third, his VA is one of the three most prolific seiyuu in anime. 

Fourth, more specifically he's pretty well known for his BL roles which brings in the absolutely massive Gintama-fujoshi vote.

To be honest, all four of these points apply (to varying degrees) to pretty much all the male cast members. The most significant being Sougo, Hijikata, Takasugi, Katsura and of course Sakamoto.

Summed up: Never underestimate the power of the fujoshi imagination and will.

That crab episode was glorious, reminded me of the Death Note parody we had really early on in the rewatch threads. I want more episodes like this.

Holy fuck that cliff hanger

Overall the first episode for this arc was amazing. It had the perfect balance of humour and seriousness. Gintama is so close to perfection. 
>> ARTICLE
Well Gintama IS perfection
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit

Didn't expect Nobunobu to be taken out immediately

Didn't expect Shogun to be assassinated in the first episode

Sacchan looks pretty in the pink yukata. Glad to have her be heavily involved in her first serious arc after seeing Otae for Benizakura and Tsukki for Courtesan of a Nation, Yoshiwara in Flames and Red Spider

Fuck, I want more

of all the long shot anime Gintama is the only one being posted at the /r/anime right? i think that only proves how good this show is haha 

currently at episode 111 and will do an intense marathon to catch up to you guys.

episode 110 katsura revolutionizing the prisoners was so heart touching then the last part gazeception wahahahahah 
>> ARTICLE
Read the manga too! There are some hilarious arcs which havent been animated, so dont miss out!
>> ARTICLE
been reading the manga until chapter 150+ then switch to anime :D
>> ARTICLE
When HxH was running the episode discussions were even more popular than these one IIRC.
>> ARTICLE
That's because most other long running shows have big subreddits and people discuss them there. 

Gintama also has a subreddit, but it's pretty small in comparison. 
>> ARTICLE
well that seems to be right so that means we should welcome gintama here at /r/anime haha

>> ARTICLE
still, if you made a one piece or naruto discussion it wouldn't be so big since the animes have kinda deteriorated and everyone reads the manga instead 
>> ARTICLE
Sooooo, I think this is off to a great start. It's as if Christmas is here 23 days in advance

Edit: Also, that OP addition is fantastic. Watched it like 3x
>> ARTICLE
The OP change made me like the song slightly more. I didn't really like it at all, but with the visual change it was a bit cooler aka I got slight chills because of it.
>> ARTICLE
They adapted the parts pretty faithfully but I felt the pacing felt a bit off?

 Sacchan's conversation with zenzou also felt weird - like she's breathing heavily. It's probably just me though lmao

Can't wait for the ninja village next episode!
>> ARTICLE
They adapted exactly 2 chapters, but yeah it felt a bit rushed.
>> ARTICLE
How many chapters has this arc been going on for?
>> ARTICLE
The shogun assassination arc itself starts at chapter 502 and ends at 524 but it transitions right into another related arc, technically you could say it's still going on till the current chapter, 566
>> ARTICLE
Well, it felt rushed, because it was also rushed in the manga, IMO. :P
I'm not reading manga, but I feel that manga readers find it rushed because of the 1 week break before these two chapters when SA Arc was first released. Also I think that for those who don't read manga (and who weren't spoiled like me >.<) it is an amazing clifchanger. Just imagine: You are watching it without knowing what will happen. Your first thought would be probably that arc will be about defending Shogun for the whole arc. Then: BOOM, he dies in first episode of the arc. Quite surprise, isn't it? :P 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it felt quite rushed so I thought they skipped some parts. Then I went to check the manga and it turns out they adapted everything which was a surprise.

 I think the lack of smooth transitions is what's making this ep feel rushed 
>> ARTICLE
Same sentiments here! I think they adapted the manga too faithfully lol, instead of slowing down the pacing and developing proper transitions. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think that's what's bothering me!
They simply went from one chapter/setting to another which felt really sudden in the anime
>> ARTICLE
But it was still good right?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they adapted the chapters faithfully which is great. Just that the transitions may be a bit jarring 
>> ARTICLE
I woke up at 6:30 in the morning, 2 hours earlier than usual, just to watch this. HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE!!!

That OP addition was amazing!!

[And there's the famous scene that defines this arc](http://i.imgur.com/UEoI4FP.png), [this is the one from the manga](http://i.imgur.com/NJpv9VU.png). This episode is the laughs before the storm, everybody.
>> ARTICLE
As for me, it's 2:21am right now. So hyped,
>> ARTICLE
Too bad the song itself is so inappropriate, they should have changed it.
>> ARTICLE
I think they kept it on purpose to show the contrast. The opening is upbeat and lively and had lively background cards during the chorus. Now it's just death and blood while the chorus talks about beautiful days. It personally gave me chills.

I think it's worth keeping in mind that the last 10 or so episodes of Gintama' took around six months to produce in comparison to the relatively quick turn-around of the current production.
>> ARTICLE
They were probably just focusing all their budget on the shogun assassination arc and not on the op


>> ARTICLE
I'm willing to bet they'll change it soon enough, this season has an OP change every 12 or 13 episodes I think so it should be coming soon.
>> ARTICLE
It should change next month if they keep changing every anime season. Looking forward to it.

Imagine a song like opening 5 or 8. Those are type of openings that fit.

It will change when the new cour arrives.

As an anime only, I wasn't expecting to be laughing hysterically throughout before the ending. The part where the shogun doubles are out spurting everywhere, WTF? :D

Gintama is the only anime I know that can pull off two very different moods simultaneously, comedy and serious action moments.

>> ARTICLE
Watch the last episode of Osomatsu-san (episode 9), then. Of course, it's also made by the director of Gintama.

The second part of the episode gets pretty serious, but heartwarming, like Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
I completely thought it was a joke, so I was waiting for him to say where the real shogun was, but then it ended. I was shocked.

Hey, havent watched it yet, but what did manga readers think of it? (im also one, so im very curious)

Edit: Just watched it and oh my god it was adapted perfectly. Not a single thing was left out, which was fantastic. It's weird for me seeing this though because i've never read a manga arc before the anime until Gintama. 

Some highlights:

-Kamui's punch was great, really felt the impact as it send Nobunobu flying

-Funniest moment for me was Gintoki's rock paper scissors. It shows how much Hattori and Gintoki must fight for Jump, because he instinctively went to that option.

-Also time for Hattori and Sarutobi to shine. The beheading scene was executed perfectly, offering a slightly different angle than the manga.

-Kamui vs Okita fight will be so hype!!! Probably my third favorite fight in the arc, but that's saying something considering how good the fights are.
>> ARTICLE
it was exactly like the manga
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was perfect. Some people complain about the pacing, but I had no problems with it. 
>> ARTICLE
Pacing was a bit fast but it was a faithful adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
Pacing was a little fast, it seems they're adapting really faithfully, but otherwise everything seems good.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, i'll be watching in a sec now so i'll give my impressions soon
>> ARTICLE
SHOOOOGUN KAYOOOO ;_;
>> ARTICLE
I'm speechless.           
If anyones reading this and still deciding whether to watch Gintama, dont wait any longer. You owe it to yourself. 
>> ARTICLE
Would I have to go back all the way to Episode 1? Not gonna commit to 300 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Someone did a fantastic write up on the show to help people catch up to where we are, im sure you could watch just the serious arcs and character introduction arcs and you would be ready for these episodes (though you would miss a lot of funny episodes). If you bare with me for a few mins ill go find you the article and the list the episodes you should watch to be able to watch this arc :) 
>> ARTICLE
Hey there, so as a follow up to what i said before, if you read [this article](http://www.animenewsnetwork.co.uk/feature/2015-11-25/a-quick-easy-guide-to-the-gintama-drama/.95789) you will be ready for the new arc.        
        
As for episodes, watch episodes 1 - 5 (introduction episodes of characters), episode 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17!, 22! Episodes 27 and 28,  episode 36! (If you have time watch this arc 40 - 42), 58 - 61 is the first really serious arc, so u need to watch this. Episode 69, id recommend watching 76 -  81, its another character introduction arc (if you have time). Episode 83. Episodes 101 ~ 105 another great arc but not necessary. Episodes 139 - 146 is must watch.  210 ~ 214 if you have time, another great arc. 257 ~ 261 IS CRUCIAL. 279 ~ 281, 290 ~ 291 (if you have time) then finally episode 300. Id also recommend you watch the yoruzuya forever movie after episode 261.          
       
Someone else may come along and say more episodes are needed and i hope they do incase i missed something when writing this reductive list up. But these are just episodes ive written down off the top of my head and after looking through episodes. Its worth mentioning that some episodes (not listed here) often have little serious moments but nothing you will need for this new arc. So yeah, watch those episodes, read that article and you will be ready. I do hope you go back at some point to watch everything else because honestly the shows so good. Anyway enjoy. 
>> ARTICLE
51-51  and 244-247 are also pretty important and 178-181 are fucking awesome (and develop Gintoki and Tsukoyo a bit) and all the shogun episodes also make this arc a lot better (like 151-152). Also skip episodes 1 and 2 they are fillers and considered the worst part of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the additional info! Im probably the only one who enjoyed those fillers by the seems of it lol 
>> ARTICLE
If you REALLY want to watch the new episodes ASAP for some reason, you can listen to kumail786 (though I'd leave out episodes 1 and 2, those aren't actually the first episodes..they're weird and episode 3 is the true beginning).

But honestly, the reason why this arc will be so good is because we have had so many episodes to learn about these characters and grow to love them, it just won't have the same impact otherwise. In both serious and funny/stupid episodes there are small things you can see about how each character interacts with each other. Also, you'd just be missing out on all of the hilarious moments if you speed through it. I really urge you to watch it all!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks dude
>> ARTICLE
You should watch ep 3-300 without skipping imo.
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree here, but it seems he hasnt got time to invest in that many so hopefully its a case of him enjoying the show so much that he does want to go back. 
>> ARTICLE
The beginning of the end.

It was a typical Gintama episode until the end.  

Man, this arc will be something else.  


Also, manga readers, we have to avoid spoiling things for anime only watchers if we see a spoiler we have to report it.
>> ARTICLE
Zenzo kinda lost his head at the end of the episode. I hope he knows where he's heading.

It seems they are in their way to Kyo, though it seems the Shogun is no longer to beheaded there.

To all anime only viewers. Let me welcome you to what may be the best arc of any anime ever. 

You know how a shonen will start with a bit of comedy and introduction for like 10-15 episodes before the real plot happens? Well this is the turning point of Gintama

I had a dream last night that I woke up and there was a two-hour movie version of the entire arc waiting for us this morning, so I'm mildly disappointed in my dream self now.

[Eeee young Sachan.](http://i.imgur.com/IQh0jhs.png) I'm liking her in a serious role for once. It's... kind of hard to take [this](http://i.imgur.com/8G9GFkF.png) seriously though.

New bumper music, I like it.

Takasugi and Kamui using the Hitotsubashi as a pawn, naturally... I wonder where the Mimawarigumi fall in this, since they were allies with Nobunobu too.

Uh.. did Zenzo just kill Shigeshige? [Speculation](/s "I hope that was just another double and Matsudaira was faking everyone out when he was announcing the plan.")

That OP change was absolutely incredible, I was worried the OP wasn't going to fit the arc but I guess that's not an issue.

I really wasn't expecting that. I hope that he isn't actually dead, but that scene was pretty convincing. These next few weeks are going to be really long...

and thus, we begin our descent into the dark abyss.

>> ARTICLE
20 minutes is too short...
>> ARTICLE
My mouth was just hanging after that ending. Just what the fuck happened?! OP addition were great, but the OP theme felt off for me.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, this is it. The point of no return for those who watch the show exclusively for the comedy. If that's you then you'd best stop here. From what I hear, s**t gets real from here on in.

So those new scenes in the OP are a'ight ^^^^BASED ^^^^SUNRISE ^^^^^DELIVERS

The song I feel is still rather off. But I suspect it'll be changed in due time.

Only now does Zenzou show up... he can sound quite villainous when he wants to.

[This show has a weird knack for mixing silly stuff into the serious scenes.](http://i.imgur.com/Ek4w7wK.png)

[Nobunobu](http://i.imgur.com/NdX9Hi3.png), [Kamui](http://i.imgur.com/Lvhe6x1.png) *and* [Takasugi](http://i.imgur.com/RafCwMK.png). A true recipe for disaster. 

Correct me if I'm wrong but is this the first time that the eyecatch/title call during the middle has changed?

[This is exactly how I feel with all this tension.](http://i.imgur.com/i8AwnRS.png)

And [that](http://i.imgur.com/KauhqgL.png) [is](http://i.imgur.com/d54lU9y.png) [it!](http://i.imgur.com/xZnLOk6.png)

This is it... there's no going back now. I mean how could they after this? The ED's had a few new additions. That Kamui and Okita fight looks like hype!

Thinking about it either Sorachi showed his hand early (with "you know whose" death") or this ride is just starting. 
>> ARTICLE
yes, i think its the first time they changed the title thing, hell they changing everything
>> ARTICLE
ah yes, the no fun allowed arcs start

wow that ending did not see that coming. zenzo...

What. i'm fully expecting zenzou will die in this arc. but not the shogun at all. plus, not by zenzou himself.. wtf..

Eh. It came across to me as a [Harry Potter spoilers](/s "Snape-Dumbledore situation. Sho-chan would definitely order Zenzou to kill him if he thought it would be better for the country. That's why he's the best leader.")

That's how I saw it too, despite having the same speculation.

Holy fucking shit. That's something I wasn't expecting on the very first episode of the arc.

This episode. Hot diggity damn.

To the manga readers, should I just wait until this arc is fully animated before watching? Maybe finally start the manga? All this hype is bad for my heart

Watch the anime if you can handle waiting every week for an episode. It's much better with the voice acting and stuff.
>> ARTICLE
just wait for the episode though i know that's hard to do!
>> ARTICLE
> should I just wait until this arc is fully animated before watching?

Considering this arc is more of a big finale arc that's still ongoing in the manga, you might as well start watching it now
>> ARTICLE
Yeah,if you would like to get hype with the rest of the redditor and have every week,enjoy the hype of the next episode but of course,it depends on yourself.

It's up to you, binge-watching it would be really epic though.

Perfect in every way. Saying anything beyond that will just be spoilers.

I was kinda discouraged at first because I thought that the changed scenes in the OP were a bit awkwardly timed, even though they're good action sequences.

But I was so wrong. It's perfect!! I can't wait for the next ep! (Though I hope they take their time. No rush)

At first the episode's animation felt a bit strange (characters eyes, and some round stuff) but the overall quality is so good that I'm not complaining. I'm looking forward to Sougo's fight next week :D
>> ARTICLE
i'm so fucking hyped
>> ARTICLE
HYPED AF IT'S FINALLY HERE.

edit: the pacing went much faster than expected o.o
>> ARTICLE
I was really expecting a new OP all together. I personally don't think the OP fits, even with the new scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit, I love how the first thing Kamui did was to punch Nobunobu lmao and Takasugi's voice is heaven. ~~I really love them even though they are somewhat enemy in Gintama, but you'll know later on... on whats behind it!~~ I also can't wait for Okita and Kamui ~~my babies~~ to fight. ~~TOO MUCH HYPE!!!~~ I also love how they make it serious and sometimes funny.. ~~they can handle that kind of stuff in one arc~~ This feels rushed to be honest, but I'm also one of those Gintama fans who want Shogun Assassination Arc to get animated. They follow the manga well and I love it. I hope they'll also change the opening ~~ASAP~~ because it doesn't really suit on the arc, well I love the ED though. ~~Get ready for some feels sooner or later~~
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't wait, so I caught up with the manga. It's so good.

The anime is doing a great job adapting it.
>> ARTICLE
I got the zenzo thing spoiled for me like 3 months ago by someone not tagging a spoiler correctly. Glad to see I can watch the rest without seeing it coming. 
>> ARTICLE
well i got spoiled another part, so i know what is coming :(
>> ARTICLE
I'm so thankful that the two things I was spoiled (the page of Zenzo lopping his head off & Sougo vs. Kamui) were shown in this episode.

>> ARTICLE
Just a yes or no will suffice, does Kondo get a serious fight in this arc?
>> ARTICLE
Contrary to other responses, YES HE TECHNICALLY DOES, though it's not a 1 vs 1 fight, he has some epic moments
>> ARTICLE
no
>> ARTICLE
Made me chuckle since his name can be read as 'this time'.
>> ARTICLE
He'll get it, just not in this arc.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit what?? That escalated really quickly. I've heard things for this arc but I didn't expect that at all. Is the shogun really dead? If so, this might be the first time a regular character dies in Gintama. Which explains why so many people said this is the point of no return. That fuckin music when he's taken out... chills everywhere.

Also didn't expect Nobunobu to get rekt immediately as well. I was under impression he will somehow have a bigger role as one of the villain boss lol.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was supposed to leave everyone with a "what the fuck just happened" expression
>> ARTICLE
So I guess I'm the only one that thinks Pride Kakumei was the best OP. Sakura Mitsusuki a close second.

>> ARTICLE
I really don't recommend anime-only watchers to watch the ending.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't agree more. One part of the ED is the biggest spoiler of Gintama that i could think of and it doesn't even happen in this arc.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, for me personally, I'm happy they did it because it [confused me ](/s "I suddenly read how Shouyou died and then the reaction for the Jump Festa ED made me think otherwise. So in my delusion, those two spoilers canceled each other out") lol
>> ARTICLE
I think you're confusing this ED with the ED they used for the Jump Festa. Either way I think it's fine...I remember manga readers saying the same thing when we first saw Kamui in the ED before/during the Yoshiwara arc. If the viewers are smart enough they'll piece things together regardless.
>> ARTICLE
> I think you're confusing this ED with the ED they used for the Jump Festa.

They're the same, aside from a post-credit scene in the Jump Festa one. It's really not recommended to watch this ending (or even what little the manga volume cover artwork show, for that matter).
>> ARTICLE
I wish the Love Potion arc was airing instead...
>> ARTICLE
anyone know how many episodes the Shogun Assassination Arc will be adapted into?
>> ARTICLE
At the current rate, probably 10 or 11 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Is this any good? I keep hearing about it.. Sorry I don't watch much anime 
>> ARTICLE
'good' is not the right word to describe Gintama. Just watch it and enjoy the roller coaster.. :)
>> ARTICLE
It's so depressing seeing a comment like this... Sir you must understand. Without Gintama. There is no life.
>> ARTICLE
O: 
>> ARTICLE
It's worth a go. Just start on episode 3 since 1-2 are a special that acts like you know who all the characters are already and is confusing.

Holy shit it's like the ending of Code Geass but actually good *all in one episode*!

Manga reader here. I never thought this day would've come. It was more glorious than I could've ever dreamt, and I'm so happy for the anime-only viewers who got to experience this plot point through the show.  Everything, *everything* was done justice and *then some*. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore; I can go die happy now.

P.S. Takasugi's voice actor stole the goddamn show.

OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

I started reading from this  arc and I have no regrets.  This is anazing.

Edit: All they going to change op everytime until next arc? That might be really cool. Also, does anyone have clip of just op? I want to save it on my phone.

No, you can't die because you can't throw away what your sensei gave you
>> ARTICLE
Fuck that line. I ought to gild you.
>> ARTICLE
God, the episode just worked so well, dedicating it to Gintoki's and Takasugi's past, not even a single other character in the present until the end :( And this arc still has 1-2 episodes left :(


>> ARTICLE
1-2?Are you sure about that?It seems like there's a whole lot of stuff still to come unless the next part isn't named the SAA.

Edit:I remembered the name of the arc I'm thinking about.People are in for a good surprise by the end of it.
>> ARTICLE
Well, if you haven't read the manga, [Very minor safe spoilers](/s "The Shogun X arc leads into another serious arc right off the bat, and we'll probably get 1-2 episodes of remaining fights and a wrapup.")

I've read the manga pretty late.Someone just reminded me of the name of the next arc that I'm thinking about.Also,you gave a dead link.I hope it's gonna air this season too instead of waiting for years again.
>> ARTICLE
Why the hell does the funniest anime have to be this goddamn tragic.

[](#holdme)

edit: this episode was just perfect, now all that's left for me is to sob silently, oh and on a slightly positive note, this episode solidified Takasugi as one of my all time favorite anime characters and probably my favorite anime antagonist.
>> ARTICLE
To be great is to embrace both sides.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck you Oboro, give Gintoki a break already. 

>> ARTICLE
nah but oboro will *break* heh 
>> ARTICLE
i was not expetcing oboro to show up and also have such a big siginficance to their past, always tought that he was just a random battle from gintoki's past
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure the movie hyped him up really hard too, omfg the movie just makes this even more sad now that I remember who gintoki was fighting in the movie QQ
>> ARTICLE
In case people haven't realized, Sorachi is at god-level when it comes to foreshadowing. Anyone interested in what I mean should go back and watch the last episode (episodes?) of the Benizakura arc and listen to what Katsura says to Takasugi. 
>> ARTICLE
what did he say?
>> ARTICLE
yep i rewatched all the arcs just for this episode right here
>> ARTICLE
Are you talking about how [spoilers](/s "Katsura says that Gintoki is bearing more than anyone, how can he live in this world when he should despite it, ect?")
>> ARTICLE
And the Sadaharu arc...the one where he turns into a monster...Seriously guys, you should.
>> ARTICLE
But this is more relevant for the arc after the current one I believe

>> ARTICLE
really that one?
>> ARTICLE
Yep. 
>> ARTICLE
ok thx, will watch it again
>> ARTICLE
There's a really really important scene missing from the anime adaptation. You should read the manga instead for that arc, trust me.
>> ARTICLE
what ch?
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 72, p6, Tendoshu commenting on the Inugami and Dragon Holes.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's page 7 and 8.

>> ARTICLE
Chapters 71-73.
>> ARTICLE
is important for which arc?

the next after this one that its airing?
>> ARTICLE
Yep
>> ARTICLE
Yup, that one has some (easily-missed, in fact it's often poorly translated) 550-chapter foreshadowing. 
>> ARTICLE
I think we can all agree that this was the best episode of Gintama ever.
>> ARTICLE
As good as the recent episodes and those before it were,I agree.I can't stand flashbacks in the middle of fights since I wanna just see the entire thing in one go,but this episode had them well timed and not all at once.
>> ARTICLE
so basically better than last weeks?
>> ARTICLE
Better out of all the episodes of all the anime I have seen.
>> ARTICLE
That Takasugi punching spree....... I almost felt that from the other side of my screen. Brutal as hell. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah, while that scene was happening it kinda felt like, the last scene in the winter section from the last of us, if anyone has ever played that you will know what i mean
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, don't remind of me of that :(
>> ARTICLE
:)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that scene was incredibly well done. The mix of flashbacks setting it up, the minimal music, and the sheer emotion in the voice actors' shouts really sent those punches home more than any other scene I can think of from anime. Each hit just felt savage and like Takasugi was beyond furious and releasing all of his pent up aggression towards Gintoki. 

Amazing episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Right? Like borderline *Last of Us* Ellie and David brutal.
>> ARTICLE
Yea that was sooo freaking powerfull, anyone that had problems with the director up till the last episode, welll I hope they are convinced now =P

Sorry, I need to pick up my jaw from the floor.

Well, I can help you out, if you're willing to help me piece together my heart.

The most important episode of the entire Gintama series.

10/10 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone who's skipped episodes for whatever reason really has to at least watch the thorny arc 244-246, and the courtesan of a nation arc 257-261 for the next episode and arc

I really liked the visuals this week in the opening, good reminder of things. Also this episode was brilliant, BNP/Sunrise still hasn't disappointed when it comes to adapting the story arcs throughout the series with great animation and directing
>> ARTICLE
I don't think anyone who watched Gintama up to that point would've been foolish enough to skip any episodes or rather even a minute/second.

10/10 anime
>> ARTICLE
Damn, directing and voice acting were on point. As a manga reader, I was not disappointed. 
>> ARTICLE
The music was really good too. I'm...just emotional right now. When Takasugi kept remembering the times he spent with Ginotoki and Zura, I became sad.
>> ARTICLE
Do you remember which chapters this episode covered? I want to compare it to the anime.
>> ARTICLE
It covered chapters 518 to 520, plus the first 3 pages of 521. :)

The anime has done a marvelous job at adapting this arc. It's been very faithful to the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Chapters 518, 519 and 520.
>> ARTICLE
518-520
>> ARTICLE
very true, the voice actors, holy shit they were good this episode
>> ARTICLE
When Takasugi was screaming while viciously punching Gintoki, i was extremely impressed.

And Gintoki's speech to Takasugi at the end was delivered perfectly. I would literally change nothing. 

Edit: oh! I almost forgot. Takasugi's speech about what his left eye saw was beautiful. When he remembered the 'hatred' with Gintoki standing infront of Shouyou's decapitated head, the way his voice actor delivered the line, had me shivering.
>> ARTICLE
yep
>> ARTICLE
Fuck. I did not see that coming

For Gintoki to carry the burden of killing his own sensei up til now must be really wearing him out

I always thought Takasugi's left eye was blinded by an Amanto when he was fighting just like in that Shiroyasha OVA only to know that Oboro was the one who did

The contrast on how Gintoki and Takasugi reacted to Shouyo-sensei's death was amazingly told. Both of them were overcome by grief but Gintoki understood Shouyo's mindset while Takasugi vowed for revenge

This is amazing. Of all the arcs I've watched, the pinnacle of this one got me reeled in and emotionally delivered

Also just noticed Mitsuba in the ED ;~;
>> ARTICLE
Well, the whole Shiroyasha OVA was just trollin
>> ARTICLE
>I always thought Takasugi's left eye was blinded by an Amanto when he was fighting just like in that Shiroyasha OVA 

Sunrise trolling xD I like how BNP put that scene in the OP
>> ARTICLE
Not really trolling. No one knew at the time how Takasugi lost that eye, so they just made it up. In fact, considering what little *was* known at the time, they did a pretty good job with that trailer.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the material they needed (Joui war) was a bit limited so they had to work with what they had

In the Shiroyasha OVA it was implied that Shouyo was killed either by the enemy or in a fire put up by the enemy. Well that wasn't the case after seeing this episode
>> ARTICLE
First time joining a Gintama discussion, and anime watcher only. I just caught up today and holy shit man. What a time to be alive. I know Takasugi has his reasons but I didn't expect it to be like this. I'm crying ;_; This whole episode is a freaking roller coaster and I don't have any intention of getting off.

Edit: I just remembered what Katsura said to Takasugi in Benizakura Arc: *"That man has always endured it. He who has the most reason to hate this world has always endured it."*

It all makes sense now.
>> ARTICLE
I'm *sooo* envious that you got to learn about everything through the anime! The manga left me scarred-- I can't even imagine being an anime-only fan right now. (Also, glad you caught the Benizakura arc reference! Sorachi planted flags long, long ago.)
>> ARTICLE
I'm really holding myself back in reading the manga. I've heard so much about the Love Potion Arc, is there any chance of it in getting animated?^^iwannaseemoreTsukkixGin

> Sorachi planted flags long, long ago.

Since I've been binge watching this show for the past few months, and since Benizakura's one of my favorite arcs, that moment really did became unforgettable. I even thought about what Zura meant by that a lot, that maybe the reason why he said that was because Gintoki's the one closest to Sensei. Oh boy.. i was partially wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Love Potion is getting [animated,](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3xfltr/gintama_love_potion_arc_to_be_animated_as_two/) not sure when we'll get it though.
>> ARTICLE
you just made my day, thanks! this means I don't have to read the manga. can't freaking wait
>> ARTICLE
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3xfltr/gintama_love_potion_arc_to_be_animated_as_two/) a thread and an article about the Love Potion arc. :)

Even up until now, the Benizakura arc is one of the best things in Gintama. When I realized Zura had said that in the arc too, I just about died  and then immediately binged the movie. Also, with that watch through, I saw Zura and Takasugi as two sides of one coin even more than Gintoki and Takasugi (especially with Zura's chopped hair). Zura and Takasugi knew each other first, and both of them are jouishishi leaders. The only difference is that one chose to resent Gintoki and the other decided to look up to him.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! :)

The movie version is incredible. The last scene is incredible. I don't know how many times I've rewatched it, srsly. One of the reasons why it's one of my favorite arcs is because I really love the scene where Gin and Zura fought together. 

> The only difference is that one chose to resent Gintoki and the other decided to look up to him.

I've never looked at it that way, wow thanks for pointing that out!
>> ARTICLE
Gin also says something to the effect of "*Don't make me a loser again*" while pleading with Seita to escape during his beating at the hands of Hosen. I believe this is also a reference to Gin not being able to protect/save Shoyo and his friends. Sorachi had big plans for Gin's backstory from the start.
>> ARTICLE
Oh right. *That one.* Damn Sorachi-sensei, you genius ~~gorilla~~ bastard.
>> ARTICLE
the foreshadowing its incredible, hell even now this arc makes the courtesan of a nation arc better, based sorachi-sensei

Edit: also benizakura and red spider
>> ARTICLE
The Shinigami Arc too, Asaemon did the same thing as Gintoki.
>> ARTICLE
There's an even greater foreshadowing with Sadaharu and Miko sisters arc, Dragon Veins. I think Sorachi have the whole story in mind from the beginning
>> ARTICLE
Can you explain please? 
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "During that time when the Miko sisters we're trying to save Sadaharu a term Dragon Vein was mentioned, it is also during this time that Utsuro(consider him a big boss), Dragon Vein is some sort of Energy well found in all planets. Sadaharu has the ability to tap into that power so is this Utsuro guy. Also i think this is the energy used for interstellar travel. Gintama is more on the gag during those days so  i guess those term are often disregarded")
>> ARTICLE
> the foreshadowing its incredible

I know right ;_; i was like, wow i didn't see that coming
>> ARTICLE
There's at least two or three more things (huge plot points) foreshadowed from even before the Benizakura arc, revealed in the upcoming arcs.
>> ARTICLE
There's something foreshadowed heavily in this episode and episode 180 as well. I'm sure manga readers can guess what that is.
>> ARTICLE
Seems like the gorilla did find after all the ultimate tactic to make people buy old DVD/tankobons.
>> ARTICLE
Courtesan of a Nation is currently IMO the best arc of Gintama (Although after this arc ends, I'm sure it'll overtake it). The next episode looks to be very intense with a lot of involvement from Oboro. Likewise, if you rewatch Courtesan of a Nation, it'll also probably feel a lot more intense too

This connection between the arcs is not only excellent storyline-wise but it also improves the arcs emotionally and adds more atmosphere
>> ARTICLE
well, right after i saw Oboro in this episode, i queued the Courtesan of Nation arc. i honestly thought Oboro was dead in that arc. lol its been years since last time watching that.
>> ARTICLE
I actually just rewatched Courtesan Of A Nation arc, and directly afterwards is the School of Beam Saber arc, where Gintoki takes the first step to take out Obi One.. true he had evil intentions BUT his speech made me think more about what made him say it. 

" *Sorry, but I'm not interested in sitting around with a bunch of emotional saps, waiting for my death. If you can't handle the job, I'll do it. It's that simple.* " 

EDIT: But after it(trying to kill Obi One)...he still had hope. Which makes me very hopeful for upcoming "twists". 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, fuck... As if that arc didn't hit me hard enough. Gintoki is used to being the "bad" guy for the sake of his friends ;_;

>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna come out and say what i'm thinking straight away. This was not only my favorite episode of Gintama, but also my favorite episode of any anime, ever. I can't believe how emotional i was and still am after witnessing this masterpiece. 

As a manga reader, this is 'the' episode we were all waiting for (and another one in the next arc). Seeing the relationship Gintoki and Takasugi once had, fall to pieces as a result of Gintoki's weak actions (i'll discuss this in the next arc) was heart breaking all over again.

Now one thing i'd like to talk about is Takasugi. I think the reason why he is my favorite antagonist of all time, is simply explained in this episode. Takasugi is justified in hating Gintoki (or at least partially justified). That's not something you can usually say about an antagonist and protagonist relationship. Gintoki not only decapitating Shouyou, but also crying for the loss permanently scarred Takasugi. Much like Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop, Takasugi sees the past in one eye while perceiving the present in the other. If he had seen an Amanto or Tendoshuu figure cut down Shouyou, he may have stayed sane. It was seeing Gintoki, his best friend, break their promise and slice the head off his sensei that made him despise the world so much. It's poetic, sad and why i love Takasugi so much.  
Edit: Look at r/takeatripp's comment. It explains everything in much more detail than i have.

Also just a little thought i had. The Gintama fandom should nickname Oboro the 'cockroach' because that bastard always comes back at the most inappropriate times aha

Just a phenomenal episode and the next episode will be incredible as well, so look forward to it anime only's :)
>> ARTICLE
Can you name the director?
>> ARTICLE
The person who worked on todays episode was not the 180 director, though he IS working on NEXT WEEK. 

http://i.imgur.com/zK92wkf.png Listed for next week's episode as director or Enshutsu 

and in 180 if you want to see, he's listed as director and storyboard http://i.imgur.com/CSxDi4P.png
>> ARTICLE
Oh really? That's strange, i was told by someone i know that it was episode 180's director. Maybe he got it mixed up.

Well crap, now i'll correct my mistake. Thanks
>> ARTICLE
Actually the director of this episode is a new one who who's only worked on the 2015 series, he did the kondo flashback episode and the one in that festival with Otae(I think it was 283). The director for 180 is actually working on next week's episode
>> ARTICLE
For Takasugi and Gintoki, it's just a tad bit more complicated than that.

Gin's under the impression that the only thing that keeps Takasugi going is his hatred for Gin. Gin himself was only choosing one promise over the other in a situation where he couldn't possibly keep both. Gin's compromise is one that shows how loyal he is to his own master that he would keep that promise before anything else. But even then, he understood that it was more important for Takasugi to hate him and continue fighting because he knew that, placed in the same situation, Takasugi would have done the same and Takasugi himself can't come to terms with that. Hence cutting at Gin because he can't cut himself down. For Gin, the idea is if anyone else would have killed Shoyo, Takasugi may have lost even the will to live.

Takasugi thinks his insanity is based purely off that moment. A broken promise, the death of his sensei, Gin's crying face. In that moment, he witnessed the pinnacle of grief before losing his eye. So, it's easy to blame Gin for the downfall, thinking it would have been better if he died and Shoyo lived. The eye he lost is much like his sanity. It still reminds him of every single moment he felt, the joys and pains of the past.

Basically, Gin's decision was neither right nor wrong, it was the only choice that could keep either of them from breaking.
>> ARTICLE
Yep it is more complicated and you said it better than i did. He tries to cut down his 'alter ego' because he needs to take revenge on himself. He knows, as you said, that under the same circumstances he would have decapitated Shouyou as well and he curses his left eye that constantly reminds him of this.

I will add something. I feel like Takasugi's words about their bushido's being not that fragile were incredibly relevant to the current situation. He's essentially broken that bushido and lived an un-samurai like life, while Gintoki has always maintained his creed. I think part of Takasugi hates Gintoki or his 'alter ego' for that too, because it symbolizes the person he once was.
>> ARTICLE
>Choosing one promise over the other in a situation where he couldn't possibly keep both.

Holy shit Jirocho. I loved the Four Devas arc, but I didn't put together how much Jirocho mirrored Gintoki in that regard. I guess the end of that arc really showed how much Gintoki's grown.
>> ARTICLE
Even though I knew what was gonna happen, damn that was emotional. That was such a great episode. Wow. And if you guys were wondering, here's a bunch of [foreshadowing](http://hajime-nii.tumblr.com/post/103069641395/this-is-a-quick-recollection-of-all-the) from several arcs :')...
>> ARTICLE
Having read through the manga just weeks before this, all of this section is still pretty fresh in my mind, and I think the anime did a phenomenal job of adapting this entire part of the arc.  
  
Takasugi really took a turn down Tragedy Character Lane with this bit of the backstory and really cleared up his animosity towards Gintoki  

Also, [that glare](http://i.imgur.com/mIjupZ9.png)

>> ARTICLE
Ohh god yea, i can't wait till they get that arc into anime form aswell!!!! :D
>> ARTICLE
The OP's visuals have changed to be more Takasugi/Gintoki focused. I wonder if they'll keep changing the visuals every episode/few episodes.

Takasugi is reminding me of Spike from Cowboy Bebop with how they both see the past with 1 eye and the present with the other.

Saying that Takasugi has a rough backstory doesn't even do it justice. Its rather impressive what Sorachi managed to do in what I assume was a couple of chapters in the manga.

Fucking Oboro! I remember thinking that he'd make a return after Courtesan of a Nation but not like this! Now we need to wait until next week!

Now that its over I can say that the voice acting was on point, particularly for Takasugi. His VA really shined in this episode. Not to say that Sugita didn't deliver a great performance too but Takasugi's surprised me more.

EDIT: [This was just a sad moment to watch.](https://d.maxfile.ro/fhgmmzxlxz.webm)
>> ARTICLE
And so it all comes out this episode. Nothing is really left unanswered about Takasugi's and Gin's past; revealing tragedy, grief, despair, as well as hope for the future. Don't worry, though. Things don't slow down next arc, not by a long shot. The revelations and changes will continue, to which I say...

All aboard the Silver Train! Your conductors will be Sorachi and BNP, sit tight and prepare for a bumpy ride.
>> ARTICLE
A few points for this episode (Fifteenth Week) (It's been a while)

1. How many bones were broken and how many ligaments were torn in that fight? Seriously, I want to know.

2. Seeing the sacrifice Gintoki made to keep Takasugi going and honoring his promise to Shoyo solidified him as the greatest Protagonist I've ever seen in anime.

3. Takasugi ascended into becoming one of the best antagonist I've seen in quite some time (He's a top three JUMP villain in my mind)

4. Really digging the opening song by DOES. They started working with Gintama in the Benizakura arc, they're still with them now.

5. Can't wait to see what will happen after this arc (Go directly to the next big arc or come up with a way o do funny bits in between)
>> ARTICLE
honestly I still think nothing can top Donten from them from I think the 3rd or 5th? Opening  but really gintama has no bad music
>> ARTICLE
It's nearly impossible to top Donten or Bakuchi Dancer. They're just so good.
>> ARTICLE
Being an anime watcher only, I always thought it was weird that Takasugi was rated 4th in the Popularity Poll arc despite that we barely knew anything about him. This arc... he deserves to be 2nd place. I love this anime.
>> ARTICLE
The Popularity Polls came long before this arc was in the manga (it was only finished at the end of 2014 and started in the July of that year), so most of his popularity came from his character design and his voice actor.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so shocked. It was so heavy. So heavy. 
My heart..wasn't ready for any of this. Gintoki's face.. Takasugi.. the feelings.

Somehow I am reminded of Gintoki in the first episodes(or was it the first openings), where he would have nightmares about the ghost of the past... Man. Gintoki's face after it happened, I can understand why Takasugi didnt want that face etched in his mind, it made me so, so, unbelievable sad but also so unbelievable grateful to the person that Gintoki is.

The more precious the burden, the heavier and more difficult it is to shoulder it.

Does anyone know what the name of the song that starts playing around 18:20? Its always played during somber or melancholy moments in Gintama, but I can never seem to find it.

Yes, this what I was looking for! Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
TOO FUCKING GOOOD
>> ARTICLE
Best episode of the entire series for me! That fist fight was so intense!
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn, did that ever deliver!

After all these years of me wondering what the deal was with that mysterious and rarely-seen "Takasugi", as well as his, Katsura and Gintoki's teacher we barely ever saw, I finally know who they are. And Gintoki, Katsura, Takasugi and Shoyo's story is an incredible one.

This arc is unbelievable.
>> ARTICLE
Just amazing episode everything worked so well. And Oboro comes to haunt Gintoki again so good.

Edit: [God damn this scene is beautiful] (http://i.imgur.com/3WaQNx4.png)
>> ARTICLE
This episode was so deep for so many reasons. In addition to what everyone else has already been discussing about the impossible nature of Gintoki's decision (either choosing to save his teacher's life or his friends, and ultimately choosing to adhere to what his teacher would have wanted, which is saving his students by killing him) and Takasugi's reaction to it, the thing that struck me most was Takasugi's comment about how he was mad at Gintoki for not giving him closure by taking his own life. If Gintoki had committed seppuku for the shame of killing his own teacher, as is custom in Japanese samurai culture, Takasugi would at least have felt some sense of closure. However, Shoyo's principles seem to directly contradict traditional Japanese samurai culture, and I'm pretty sure if Gintoki committed seppuku, he would have been directly contradicting Shoyo's teachings, yet this is what Takasugi wanted Gintoki to do. I'm sure Gintoki himself has probably contemplated seppuku as well, but refuses to do so out of respect for Shoyo's teachings. Not sure if I'm reading too much into it or if Sorachi even meant anything by it, but for me, this was the most profound part of the episode: the dichotomy between Shoyo's teachings and samurai culture that exists inside Takasugi's mentality. This was honestly my favorite episode of any anime ever that I can recall, and it really says something that a series like Gintama can pull off something like this and have the best humor of almost any show I've watched. Greatest anime ever honestly.
>> ARTICLE
It's times like this where Gintama's soundtrack starts to shine.
>> ARTICLE
jesus fucking christ this was perfect  
the voice acting was god-level too, holy shit
>> ARTICLE
I'm speechless...especially after reading that everything was foreshadowed...wow...Masterpiece..
>> ARTICLE
Which one of you left this bowl of onions here? The heart is hurting right now and the tears are flowing. The one thing that meant the world to them, was the one they chose to sacrifice in order to survive. I get the feeling that if Gintoki chose differently, Takasugi probably would've ended up killing himself.

And of all the times to show up, Oboro chooses now. God I loved this episode. The voice acting was great and the action was intense. Gin vs Takasugi is officially in my top 5 favorite battles period.
>> ARTICLE
this just gets better and better. so satisfying!
>> ARTICLE
This episode gave me chills.  


It really was something else.    

Man, I love Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
I was not ready for this....

Best Episode of this season.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is another one of those super long running shows i wish i would of got into early. The only long running show i actually liked and kept up with was dragon ball/dbz i got in on bleach and naruto early but dropped them fairly fast.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man this episode was *everything*. I know I'm biased because I love Gintama but this might just be the best anime episode ever Sorachi is a genius for foreshadowing everything so perfectly + the animation was unreal when Takasugi was punching Gintoki I literally covered my face. And the VA's did such a good job I'm in awe rn
>> ARTICLE
I finally caught up and my heart is immediately torn to shreds. Takasugi has reached my top villain spot. Next week might be a big one though. I have no idea what's coming, but I'm (not) ready.
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader, this episode was truly everything and more. Reading the reactions of anime-only watchers in this thread only proves that further! Koyasu Takehito and Tomokazu Sugita were always perfect for their characters from the start, but after 300+ episodes, this is the one that proves that fact the most.

Also, the ED song/visuals are even more painful this time! :'(
>> ARTICLE
Takehito Koyasu has always been a great voice actor. He always brings out the best in every role that he performs.
>> ARTICLE
Any chance that we'll get see Katsura in this arc?
>> ARTICLE
don't worry you see him enough in next big arc.
>> ARTICLE
And the one after that where he gets is super badass moment :D
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "nope")

He's on stand-by.

Hey guys, im interested in gintama but i hear it doesnt have a story, should i just not watch this, cause i know i dont like episodic anime...


JK, gintama is fucking awesome, you fuckin plebs xD
>> ARTICLE
Nobody even noticed that he is being sarcastic ...
>> ARTICLE
its fine
>> ARTICLE
WHERE THE FUCK IS KATSURA? 

Sure, Gintoki and Takasugi really needed this moment alone, but am I the only one wondering what the living FUCK Katsura is doing at this moment?! 
>> ARTICLE
Soon my friend, soon...
>> ARTICLE
Probably something secretly badass.
>> ARTICLE
Uno with Elizabeth. 
>> ARTICLE
He's on standby
>> ARTICLE
If you listen closely enough, you can hear someone's heart breaking from watching this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching Gintama for the past 2 months and just yesterday I cought up to the last episode so I'm really glad I got to watch today's episode and cry with the rest of you. 
>> ARTICLE
Gintama just keeps outdoing itself, and when I think it can't get any better, it fucking keeps going. That's insane. One of the best episodes of any anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Takasugi's cries of rage when he was repeatedly punching Gintoki really... chill your bones.
>> ARTICLE
This is it boys, this is the reveal manga readers were all hyped about. This is the background Gintoki, Katsura and Takasugi acted upon throughout the whole series.

It adds so much depth to almost every serious arc and makes us appreciate the carefree funny episodes even more.
 
>> ARTICLE
wait. he isnt dead is he? pls tell me he isnt :(
>> ARTICLE
HOLYSHEIT!! Takasugi.. no!! Gintoki.. why??
>> ARTICLE
This episode executed almost everything perfectly.

I pictured the scene with Gintoki crying to be somewhat different in my head. I feel like the manga did that particular scene better imo, but otherwise this episode far outshines the manga chapter. It was so well done, so emotional, and so epic. 

 Gintoki and Takasugi's voice actors did a phenomenal job this episode. The part when Takasugi begged Gintoki not to kill Shoyo and said "Please!" was heart wrenching.

I'm so excited for the rest of this arc!!!
>> ARTICLE
Yep i felt the same. It needed to show his crying face for a longer period of time. Though technically if Takasugi was running, then this is more realistic quick look at Gintoki....but still.


Yeh i agree. The anime did it better for pretty much everything.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus christ. Backed into a corner with no choice left but to kill your own master... and seriously what the fuck? In the exact moment when I went from disliking to loving a character ("I haven't been expelled yet, have I?") HE FUCKING DIES. Fuck this shit, i'll be back next week.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone give me a quick recap on Oboro? I'm afraid of googling since i'll most likely come across spoilers

edit: i asked so i don't have to go rewatch an arc since my time is limited, but thanks anyways
>> ARTICLE
Watch the courtesaen of the nation arc if you haven't watched it yet for some unexplicable reason.
>> ARTICLE
You may want to watch the Thorny arc and the arc with Sadasada and the old courtesan. Oboro is related to Nobume (sadist blue-haired police chick) and has a triforce logo.
>> ARTICLE
Gintoki thought he killed him in Courtesan.
>> ARTICLE
I thought he died there where he fell on gintoki's sword :/ 
>> ARTICLE
He was shown alive in the final episode of that arc talking with the Tendoshou and Nobume about Gintoki and Takasugi..... 
>> ARTICLE
Nah, it was shown afterwards he appeared in some hardcore Tendosho meeting telling his bosses that the real threat are the disciples of Shoyo. Then we saw him talking to Nobume.
>> ARTICLE
He is the leader of Naraku the army of assasins and works under the Tendoshou as it was shown on this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Near perfect episode of Gintama! The only thing I didn't like was the flashy lights that appeared every time Gintoki and Takasugi had a sword clash. I would've preferred a more simplistic animation style (e.g. Kagura vs Abuto). It would've have made it look more realistic.

Best flashback I've ever seen! The voice acting was superb!

Still a 9.5/10 for me.


>> ARTICLE
Gintama is just way too good for this world.
>> ARTICLE
The one character who I didn't expect to die, Takasugi, is killed?

Damn, I was just starting to like him.

Anyways, why don't Katsura hate Gintoki too?

>> ARTICLE
You should revisit the end of the Benizakura arc/movie. Zura tells Takasugi himself on that ship. He used to want to burn the country down for taking Shouyou, but seeing how Gintoki of all people just bears his cross, Zura feels like he doesn't have the right to be that spiteful.
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader, I'll say this: This arc is not yet done, so hold on to your seat.
>> ARTICLE
This is the one thing I dislike about what anime has done to me- Even if someone has a sword thrown through their stomach, I refuse to believe that they are dead before the scene where their eyes close and they are engulfed by a blinding white light.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you're not wrong.

If anyone remember Oboro from the Courtesan arc, he was impaled too in a gruesome fashion and yet here he is. Gintoki too has a blade sticking out in this episode. As such, the logical assumption here could be only that Takasugi is just merely incapacitated / grievly injuried here, not really killed (yet?).

In Gintama, apparently even people having their bodies slashed in half isn't enough to kill them. Maybe when they're beheaded. Maybe.
>> ARTICLE
Because Katsura probably understands the impossible choice Gintoki had to make and that his actions were also Shoyo's will. 
>> ARTICLE
absolutely nuts, entire episode was stunning, literally
>> ARTICLE
I wish I wouldn't have to wait another week for the next episode
>> ARTICLE
And I just realised that the Takasugi vs Gintoki fight has now set the bar for the final Naruto vs Sasuke fight. The entire success of Naruto Shippuden's ending depends upon whether they can top this or not. 
>> ARTICLE
Trust me....you ain't seen nothing yet. Naruto ain't got shit on what's coming. :(
>> ARTICLE
Considering canon returns this year. 
>> ARTICLE
Is Gintoki the best character ever?
>> ARTICLE
He is at least best shonen protagonist. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode was sad as fuck, I teared up and seeing both Gintoki and Takasugi's rage was brutal. I think I need to clear my head after seeing that. Even as a manga reader I wasn't prepared for this.
>> ARTICLE
These last two episodes have been amazing.
>> ARTICLE
the fucking goosebumps wont stop...
>> ARTICLE
The next thing I checked back after watching this episode is the SHINIGAMI ARC. When I first watch this arc, it doesn't appeal me so much like previous arc since the whole plot and backstory is just like a short story inserted along the past, without significant connection from the Joui wars, except the NEXT SCENE might be the cementery where Otose found Gin. Basically, Gin just saved Asaemon before with sort of promises blablabla.

And then....... insert the beheading of his sensei. I understand now the emotional scene before throwing the skull at the end. And certain lines during the battle with Yaemon. Imagine the half of the arc how Gin is traumatized and devoured of Asaemon beheading his sensei.

This made me appreciate this Arc more.

Also, I read somewhere that during the flashback, Gin is already using a wooden sword when he saved Asaemon. This is the closest timeframe after the end of war (beaheading of sensei). 

Do you think that aside from the sword ban, the reason why he is using a wooden sword came from the grudge and trauma from his killing of his sensei? (Katura and Takatsugi are still using real sword btw . Nevermind, they are terrorists XD)


>> ARTICLE
And I thought only HxH was the only shounen that could rip my heart out like this.

I need... a moment
>> ARTICLE
Well, I guess not being caught up is biting me back. But first is there any arc I NEED to watch for next episode? I'm still gonna watch it all, but I want to prioritize by importance then go back later.
>> ARTICLE
So... why exactly are Oboro and the Tendoshu here now? Is it because Takasugi killed Sadasada? 
>> ARTICLE
Super giant spoiler about the end of this and the next arc if I told you, sorry you just gonna have to wait one week :)
>> ARTICLE
Remember when Oboro said the disciples of Shoyo are their only threats? I guess they;re acting on that.
>> ARTICLE
That question will be answered next Wednesday when Gintama episode 306 airs. 
>> ARTICLE
THAT QUESTION WILL BE ANSWERED NEXT WEDNESDAY MORNING, WHEN GINTOKI TAKES ON TAKASUGI IN THE WWE SUUUUUUPERSLAAAAAAM.
>> ARTICLE
WOW AWESOME EPISODE AND OBORO IS BACK(it's been a while)!!!!!!!!!! and still looks goddamn the same vs. the past, is he an ALIEN?????????
>> ARTICLE
Okay so I havent watched ANY of gintama since they started airing again. Anyone know what arcs past w/e episode it started that i should watch? including this one possibly?

>> ARTICLE
watch episode 279 till 281 then you can watch this and maybe also watch 271, 272 and 290,291 but maybe that is optional, i think these last episodes i listed arent important for this arc but maybe for the next arcs that are coming
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, when will episode 306 came out??
>> ARTICLE
So, who do you guys think is more fucked up, Killua or Gintoki?
>> ARTICLE
I think the fact the Gintoki was able to move on from what happened and still live his life normally shows how not fucked up he actually is
>> ARTICLE
This is so true. Gintoki is probably the least fucked up person out of everyone. Anyone would be fucked up with his past, but this guy is just chilling like nothing happened, and deep down he still thinks about his past. 
>> ARTICLE
That's what all the sweet strawberry milk is for, it helps keep him calm. 
>> ARTICLE
He's the least fucked up... until of course you start messing with his friends and loved ones. Remember that first fight he had with Jirocho? He was in wild animal mode. It was scary.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck. You know, I was actually starting to get a bit bored of Gintama. Before I opened up this episode, I wasn't really feeling it. I didn't feel the hype. It was a good arc so far and all, but I thought maybe I was just growing out of it.

But you know what? This episode has completely restored my faith. That was hard hitting. It was the kind of emotional intensity I felt from when I first watched the series, years ago. The backstory that was teased for the entire goddamn series has finally been delivered to us, and it was truly beautiful. Thank you, Gintama.

sooo is this new guy gintokis dad? because he could totally be gintokis dad.

A Matsui Bou (Matsui Stick) is a type of homemade cleaning device created a Japanese actress named Kazuyo Matsui. Known to to be an extreme cleaning enthusiast, she's blogged and written books in how to make cleaning easier as well as more convenient. A Matsui Bou can be easily made with chopsticks wrapped in gauze and held together by a rubber band. Because the stick is such a thin device, it can reach crevices that regular dusters cannot.

I knew this episode was going to be good when the Shinsengumi showed up, everything after that was just gravy.


Seeing Elizabeth with the hole punched through her almost killed me.  I've missed this show in a big way and I'm so glad there are new episodes.

Pretty sure elizabeth is a guy. If anything it was confirmed in the Renho arc.

To be fair, that was Monday-Elizabeth.

You're forgetting that the entirety of the Renho Arc only applies to Monday-Elizabeth.

But yeah, probably a dude.

Crap completely forgot about that.

I was 120% sure that after all the attempts trying to open Hijikata's hand, there wouldn't have been a battery but something entirely different.

The red Mayonnaise cap. He probably took the cap off to squeeze every last drop possible. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought that Arc was going to go on for a long time, but nope two episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Curious why you thought that?  It's pretty well established at this point that most comedy arcs are only usually ever like, 2-3 episodes long.  Even the really serious, dramatic, and fight-filled arcs only ever go like, 5 episodes tops.  This isn't Naruto or Bleach or any other typical shounen show/comic where story arcs get drawn out because the writers are hacks with no imagination.  Gori-sensei is a CHAMP.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama Endless Eight?  That could actually be amazing.

Don't give the Gorilla ideas....he might actually troll us hard.

How did the battery go from Hijikata's popped arm to the Matsui stick that evolved? 
>> ARTICLE
Why didn't they just go back in time to before Hijikata picked up the battery? Hell, to before the shinsengumi even set up a crime scene.

This arc didn't make a lot of sense. Just laugh.
>> ARTICLE
It was stated in the first episode they could only go back in time to the exact moment the clock broke (or when the battery died). 
>> ARTICLE
At which point, the battery would be sitting in the crashed UFO, right?
>> ARTICLE
From my understanding (if I'm wrong I apologize) after realizing the clock ran on a battery they reset everything as far as they could in order to go look for the battery. If they didn't hasegawa and the old man would have still been killed by Piccolo when they set the time to move forward as the moment they were currently in the beam had already passed through both of them.
>> ARTICLE
I read that as - they tried putting the Matsui stick on at a time before he could pick it up.  That way, when he goes to pick up the battery, he can't, because all he has is a Matsui stick.  But little do they know...
>> ARTICLE
*who knows*

Couldn't stop laughing in this episode. 

Only Gintama would have a sound effect saving the world XD

Wish CrunchyRoll would do 'translator notes' explaining Gintama's many references. I'm sure there were some references in today's episode that I missed.

RumbelSubs were my favourite for Gintama. 
>> ARTICLE
Its not really necessary IMO.  A joke explained is a joke ruined.  And even if Gintoki & Co reference some bit of pop culture that we don't understand, usually the reference isn't the joke, it's the absurdity of the scenario itself that is.  Even if you didn't know Gin was parodying a specific politician in the opening moments of the first episode, that doesn't make the joke of Gin-san being ridiculous any less funny.
>> ARTICLE
IMO, it still adds to the flavor. 

Or, you can read reddit comments and someone will be there to explain the relevant reference anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
> Wish CrunchyRoll would do 'translator notes'.

I'm not sure what happened to those, they had them right at the start then they went away for a bit just to return and then vanished again permanently.
>> ARTICLE
Are you talking about this episode? Crunchy roll's never done translator notes (none that I can remember). They'll directly translate any text that's on the screen, but in terms of the the translator explaining the reference for some of Gintama's gags for the viewers to understand? Nope.
>> ARTICLE
> Are you talking about this episode?

Sorry I was referring to episode 1. Like the *really* early stuff has TL Notes sometimes thrown in explaining the references.
>> ARTICLE
Those were most likely fansubs and as the name implies done by fansub groups in a time when official crunchy-roll subs didn't exist.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that would make sense given how the subs were a different colour (yellow compared to CR's typical white) among other things.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, almost everything was fansubbed back then and waiting for the release of them could be quite painful lol.
>> ARTICLE
I'll bet it was. I would've hated having to wait like that, especially in the serious arcs.
>> ARTICLE
I recently watched all of Gintama on CR and they did sometimes have a lot of translator notes, explaining what anime they were parodying and explaining references to actors and real life events and stuff. There were long periods of time when they had translator notes for pretty much everything, then they wouldn't, then they would again. But towards the end of the last seasons they hadn't had any. It seems they went through several different translator groups, as you can also sometimes tell with how they at one point translated Madao as DORK (dumb old retarded kook) then later on translating it as how Madao actually was.

Hey guys, do I need to watch the first seasons of Gintama or can I start from here....jk. 

Yes, it's Wednesday morning with a new Gintama episode!! I can't stop rejoicing!
>> ARTICLE
but can you actually tho? [serious] ive watched a hundred or so episodes i think
>> ARTICLE
Can you? Sure you can. I wouldn't though. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, after a hundred episodes most (if not all) characters from these 2 episodes are introduced iirc so you can watch them if you feel like it.
>> ARTICLE
But many important story arcs (like Courtesan of the Nation) are not in those 100 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, while these 2 episodes are "safe" I wouldn't recommend watching farther because I don't know what's coming up.
>> ARTICLE
still lots of save episodes in front of us before shits going down.
>> ARTICLE
Depends, how much are they going to skip?

For the last time they actually skipped quite a bit, and even this time they skipped like 40 or so comedy chapters, (I really hope they atleast do the gender bender still :( ), so probably yea, but you can never be entirely sure!


>> ARTICLE
I think they are going to catch up with the comedy chapters now with this season. Next episode is gonna be the Tama and Yamazaki episode, which was skipped before.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, figured as much.
>> ARTICLE
Not recommended, you should at least catch up when we get to the shogun arc, which still leaves you lots of time.

I see not problem with watching the comedy episodes with us though.
>> ARTICLE
ye can anybody tell me too? I'm clueless where to start.... jk.
Yay Gintama :O
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, I just noticed the notice stickied to the top of /r/anime. I can't believe people have actually asked if they can skip 265 episodes of a show and start with new episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Go look at the first discussion thread, it was asked so many fucking times
>> ARTICLE
You know, you probably could skip everything and start here... the show is very episodic, with very little in the way of continuity.  It's perfect for syndication because it doesn't really matter the order in which you watch most of the episodes.

The real question is, *why would you want to skip it?*  This is one of the few shows that's just so amazing, that you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice by writing any of it off.  Because if you do get into the show, there will, some day, come a time when you'll run out of new episodes and that is guaranteed going to be a top-3 saddest day of your life.

> You know, you probably could skip everything and start here... the show is very episodic, with very little in the way of continuity. It's perfect for syndication because it doesn't really matter the order in which you watch most of the episodes.

I can't agree with you here. You might be fine for a little while, but then you'll be super confused and not get any of the reoccurring references. Next episode will draw on the Yamazaki/Anpan episode... new viewers would have NO IDEA what that is supposed to be about.

And that's not even considering the Shogun Arc, which you'd be entirely out of the loop for.

> You might be fine for a little while, but then you'll be super confused and not get any of the reoccurring references.

I mean, most viewers aren't going to get a lot of the show's Japanese pop culture references anyways, no matter how much Gintama they've watched.  What's a fistful of extra jokes they won't get on top of that?  Like obviously, to get the most out of Gintama, you should watch everything.  All I'm saying though, is that you could probably get by w/o it just fine.

This isn't Game of Thrones or anything where there's this huge complicated web of intrigue and character histories/interactions that are quintessential for understanding anything.  Yamazaki is a plain guy who likes Anpan and Badminton - like that's really it.  You don't need to have seen 250+ episodes to know that (hell, they straight up tell you all this in the episode preview).  Tama is a robot who works as a barmaid for Otose.  You don't need to see her origin story or Tama Quest to understand the gist of her character.

Jumping in here isn't ideal, but it's fine.  Telling someone they have to catch up to 250+ episodes just to watch this just to join the conversation is going to be such a daunting task, no matter how good those 250+ are going to be, that a lot of people just won't bother.  If you want to get into say, Superman comic books, you don't tell somebody "Start with Action Comics #1 and work your way to the present" - that's just ludicrous.  You let them jump on whenever, and once they're hooked, then they go back to explore the stuff they skipped.

FTFY

Common sense isn't that common really

>> ARTICLE
then again fate/stay is comprehendable.  
Normally i would watch series in order of release.  fate/stay had the sequel released first and at that time i just saw that there was a prequel so i watched that first and was kinda disappointed at how much worse production quality was.  nowadays it's even more complicated with there being 2 seasons of fate/stay night.  

on the other hand google is your friend.

[Poor Elizabeth.](http://i.imgur.com/lEtpwy8.png) Perfect timing on hitting Otae in the head though, and I didn't even notice the visible sound effect at first. I love the medium-aware jokes like manipulating text.

Aaaaaaand they're out of juice. Ham-san saves the universe after all.

Love the post-ED ending, though I still disagree with them calling it the third season considering that was back in the 100-150 range and they even called it such back then.

The next episode sounds fun. [Preview](/s "Yamazaki/Tama? That's not a ship I've ever considered before and I'm guessing that's the point.")

I'm also a bit confused on that end. Does anyone have any insight on why that change was made?
>> ARTICLE
> though I still disagree with them calling it the third season 

I believe the reason was to do with the time between the episodes airing. Normally at the most there was only a 2 week gap between an episode airing and a one off case where it was a 7 month gap between episode 252 and 253. Other than that each season represents a much larger gap in the airing schedule.

The gap between what CR consider season 1 and 2 was around a year. The final episode from season 1 ended on March 25 2010 and season 2 started on April 4, 2011. 

The final episode of season 2 ended on March 26, 2012 and last week was the start of season 3 so it was an even longer gap. 

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gintama_episodes#Gintama) has dates of each episode air date, but its Wikipedia. However it does make a bit of sense when looking at it.
>> ARTICLE
The joke in the title  or "gintama" written with a small "" over the , or "ta", is that, in Japanese, the small circle symbol is used to change an "h" sound into a "p" sound (like "ha"/ into "pa"/). The fact that it is written above a "t" sound (), however, makes no sense.

The joke is that Gin writes the title down so that the reporters can read it, but what he writes down makes no sense. Hence Shinpachi shouting "ginpama!" and Gin making fun of him.

[Here's](http://imgur.com/ayIkKVi) the phonetic script if you're interested.

Edit: Clarity

I almost forgot about Gintama today. Thanks GTA V... on the plus side the show airs as 11am for me so at least I won't lose sleep unlike people across the pond.

**Episode 267**

For once the recaps are useful since I no longer watched the previous episode 25 minutes ago.  

Stop teasing us with this Gintama platformer! I will admit its a rather nice way to explain what I believe is the Butterfly effect.

Everything runs on AA batteries, even mystical clocks that control time. The inventor must be chuffed.

Ham-san, the hero that the show needs but doesn't deserve.

Sounds like a communication issue going on here if your production committee can't understand the show's brand.

that ending bit was fantastic (now i need a webm of that) 
>> ARTICLE
The "Wham" to "Ham" translation. Was that correctly translated? Did it get translated this way in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
I dunno about the manga, but Gin turned  (gossu) into  (gosu). Gossu is just sort of a sound effect like pow or wham, so crunchy translated gosu (which also means nothing) into ham, since it's like wham with a bit knocked off.
>> ARTICLE
It's the same exact gag from the manga.  The word doesn't literally mean ham.  They're just doing a wordplay where if you subtracted a letter/character from the onomatopoeia, the resulting SFX sound verbalized doesn't sound as threatening.  So Gossu becomes Gosu, Wham becomes Ham.

The manga version of this chapter actually has a whole bunch of other gags in it that the anime left out dealing with the character's word bubbles being physical things stuck in time.  Gintoki would cross things out and write over it (so he had Ketsuno Ana literally saying 'this is today's husband instead of the TV next to her).  And in the beginning when Otose is demanding rent and she gets knocked over, her word bubble breaks and Gintoki take the part that says 'rent' and throws it away as if that could get him to avoid having to pay rent.

Honestly, so many Gintama puns translate so well into English, I can't even tell if the translators are making them up to fit the scene or if the Japanese writer actually made the puns in English. Can someone explain how the process for translating Gintama Japanese puns into English works? For example, the Wham to Ham in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Usually it's the job of the translator to either try and translate the pun or just create a new one, like the wham/ham pun. The writers (for Gintama especially) usually don't have an English-speaking audience in mind. Subtitles do not always have to match up with the dialogue, especially things that don't translate easily.

About the wham/ham pun.  (gossu) is just a sound effect.  (gosu) in this instance has no real meaning (apart from it sounding softer). Due to its nonsensicalness in English, here it was just easier for the translator to create a new pun (wham/ham)

**Ep. 257**  Welp, I have a new favorite opening. The quality of the lighting work and level of detail wasnt even fair to the other OPs. And thats not even getting into the awesomeness of the track. 

Looks like well be revisiting the same motifs from the other two Yoshiwara-centric arcs. Insert Parasyte joke for the hair pact. Gin, theyre setting you up with a legendary courtesan and youre dishing out insults. Oh. Oh

[Dick Entry  5:35  Gintoki  Suzuran](http://i.imgur.com/YpNdrlS.png)

A promise to escape the city is pretty damn romantic. Hinowas musing over the impermanence of a Yoshiwara night is pretty damn poetic. This is going to be a good arc. Tsukky and Gin bickering. Contender for best arc. Oh boy, were getting the Shogun mixed up in everything. I expect at least one The Shoguns have traditionally joke, show. She seemed familiar but I had to [look it up]( http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Tokugawa_Soyo ). Thats a 243 episode absence. Isaburos back already? Ah, Takasugis affiliation with him makes a lot more sense given how close Isaburo is to the highest of powers. Geeze, cell phones to Isaburo are like signs to Elizabeth. The more I hear of Nobume, the more she strikes me as the female equivalent of Okita. [Abort. Abort! Run! All is lost! Get out of there!](http://i.imgur.com/0ibat0E.gif).

*****

**Ep. 258**  Gin finally took my advice and Tsukky stopped him. And into my hands my face goes. The show is trying to kill me by way of second-hand embarrassment. Isaburo plays too rough. Oh, I think I see where were going with Grampy.

[Dick Entry  7:06  Shogun  Shogun](http://i.imgur.com/u5vHHdq.png)
	
Objective achieved much faster than I would have imagined. Oh hey I know I unloaded multiple magazines worth of bullets at you a minute ago but please be my email buddy. This is why running away was a smart decision. Isaburonooo^I ^guess . At this point the Shinsengumi enforcing anything involving the Odd Jobs should be treated as a conflict of interest. Liked the storybook look of Soyos bedtime tale. Damn Sadasada can hold a grudge. New objective: seize the country and reunite Suzuran and Grampy. I love the sideways look Okita gives Nobume as she calls the Shinsengumi out and walks off. Too bad Katsura is on standby. Things you dont do: expect your daughter figure to NOT repeat your dirty jokes.

*****

**Ep. 259**  I love how thuggish, gloating Kagura always makes an appearance when she has the upper-hand. Soyo, you fail to grasp the severity of things. I stand corrected, shes got a handle on the weight of it. Not so much on being conscious though.  

> This nation has no respect for women

Tsukky may have accidental groping scenes. Kyuubei may comically overreact to being romantically flustered. Otae may get called a washboard and have an uninteresting cameltoe. Sacchan may be a walking S&M joke. But Ill still contend that Gintama has a slew of kickass female characters and a sense of respect for their worth. Nation be damned.

The Bakufu have nothing on Odd Jobs with that weak turret bullshit.

> You must silently accept that fate

Uh, have you seen this show, Baskethead? Grampy no! Holy shit thats a brutal metaphor.

Your successor and his slurred-speech police buddy are here for your head.

> Is it too late to fulfill your promise?

You underestimate the emphasis were putting on promises here, Shogun. In a way, I can sympathize with Sadasada in that he had to deal with an issue more complicated than I hope Ill ever have to be held responsible for. Still, being a dick to your subordinates and acting in your own self-interest might have brought this whole rebellion thing about. Fairly high body count this week. Dont think youre going to get through to Gins stubbornness, Oboro. Sadasada no-Oh wait. Sorachi sure does like taking fights to the rooftop. Holy shit Shoyo looks like the love-child of Katsura and Okita. [Literally falling on his sword](http://31.media.tumblr.com/a9e7815e4e0acd546ad228fdb31d2319/tumblr_n8v7s6AqOx1sycuvlo2_250.gif). I see what you did there, show.

*****

**Ep. 261**  Winner of the most out-of-place ED. From the Shogun himself: convictions > laws. Only takes a resignation note to get pulled down from the Heavens. "Fairies". Oh boy. Time to take notes on the politics arising from taking Sadasada down. Oboro proving that you arent dead until the body is shown.

Thanks for the background check on Nobume, Oboro. Takasugi has the most indirect ways of communicating with Gin. Final moon. [HNNNG]( http://i.imgur.com/QgfihxGl.jpg ). I take it Nobume snuck everyone into the palace? I demand Shinsengumi schoolyard shenanigans. Not exactly a cherry blossom tree, but itll do. Oh my god.

That's one thing I love about this show, so many strong female characters. And equal amounts of disrespect between genders.

Why does it have to end!

That 1st piece of fanart would make a great framed picture. Weve only got 4 episodes left and the 2 movies but on the plus side its not long until the new season starts! I almost never managed to watch all the episodes this week due to College deadlines but I managed none the less. Anyway you didnt come here to read about my personal life, onto Gintama.

**Episode 257 ** This OP looks really pretty with the cherry blossoms which Im expecting to show up at some point during this arc. This might actually be one of my top 5 OPs. Making a promise to see each other when the moon rises again, does this not seem like a scam to get more money? This legendary courtesan was older than expected but its Gintama, Ive learned to never expect anything normal. Theres that promise under the moon again. [Guess I wasnt the only one who saw that scam.](http://i.imgur.com/2Iwovnf.png) [Havent seen you in a while.](http://i.imgur.com/fbAV9zd.png) Gin x Tsukuyo is as strong as ever. Former Shogun!? Prepare for more Shogun antics! [I vaguely remember this friendship.](http://i.imgur.com/Yj8Pnpl.png) Sasaki is back with [his clinginess.](http://i.imgur.com/bRT4l1o.png) [Gramps Confirmed masochist.](http://i.imgur.com/gxzh91F.png) The female equal of Sougo joins in the fun! You know things are not going well when Gin is the voice of reason. [Thats our Shogun!](http://i.imgur.com/bj4wTOj.png) The start of this ED sounds like something for a kids show, I like the art style though. Teasing the movie for a summer release?
*****
**Episode 258 ** [Begin the wincing.](http://i.imgur.com/ETR07ZW.png) [Tsukkys face here is great.](http://i.imgur.com/LHtdtzl.png) Butterfly away! Well there goes the Shoguns identity. That went serious fast. [Never change Sougo.](http://i.imgur.com/7FF02jP.png) Soyo sleeping outside the cell is one of those Only in Gintama moments. So Maizou was the one who made the promise. The Shinsengumi are such bros. [Hes probably on standby.](http://i.imgur.com/HFACdJS.png) The pressure is mounting and Im getting giddy thinking about what is going to happen next. Again with the movie teasing.
*****
**Episode 259 ** I wonder where the current Shoguns been all this time. [The face of my nightmares](http://i.imgur.com/nSrftyX.png) The Three Sadisteers has a nice ring to it. [And who said female characters cant be strong.](http://i.imgur.com/udnZVkg.png) The Old Shoguns still got some cards up his sleeve, the Oniwabanshu being one of them [I cant take this guy seriously when he wears a basket on his head.](http://i.imgur.com/i7ymqBm.png) [I love this shot.](http://i.imgur.com/CL53Rhe.png) This fight while good doesnt feel as previous fights for me, Im sure this will change later though [Now its personal!](http://i.imgur.com/LXkGQJs.png) Another small snippet of backstory for Gin is revealed. Only the current Shogun could unite the police forces like this. The show is relentless with this movie teasing.
*****
**Episode 260 ** Now things really kick off with both the Shinsengumi and MImawarigumi teaming up. I was starting to wonder why Sasaki used a revolver for Gin but that question answered itself shortly after. Matsudaira! I missed your sexy voice. For the first time the Shogun is actually acting like a Shogun. Going back to the point of origin huh. Shame our heroes stopped it from happening. Now the real fight begins. [Another promise that wont be forgotten.]http://i.imgur.com/NcIjb2V.png) Is it just me or did this episode have a lot of explosions. Stop teasing us damn it!

*****
**Episode 261 ** Preparing for the inevitable AMV at the end one would assume. Increment the lecture counter for the Shogun. Shigeshiges resignation is bound to have some aftereffects. [These are some nice looking fairies.](http://i.imgur.com/dlkogQK.png) [Hes too important to die.](http://i.imgur.com/X5Ju0zR.png) Once again Takasugi got bored of being a mere observer. [Nobume has a background with the Naraku too?](http://i.imgur.com/bLzAKyc.png) This is the first arc that made the idea of Gin & Takasugi working together not be a pipe dream due to their equal amount of hatred for Sada Sada. No doubt well be getting another arc on this shadow war between the two factions at some point. Its funny to think about how this all started from a promise. I dont remember when I was cutting these onions. [You can always rely on Gintama to end an arc in style.](http://i.imgur.com/svZOXbz.png) Im not sure where I would rate this arc to be honest. I felt it had a slow start but really kicked into gear in the latter half.

Thankfully even if Weekly Gintama ends we will still have the Gintama threads every week.  
(Btw it airs every Wednesday starting 8th April 11:00 JST on TV Tokyo, Crunchyroll simulcast unknown)  

I was planning to ask /u/Shadoxfix if his bot can capture Gintama and post the threads automatically or do we have to request it or something?  

Ooops, I accidently asked him already.  
There shouldn't be any dangerous spoilers around so come at ease.  

edit: I forgot he has 1000 threads so he probably disabled all kinds of notifications already. I'll message him.

**Ep. 257** - Ooh, cherry blossom opening. Pretty. [Nobume's back already?](http://i.imgur.com/ztgiZ02.png) Also [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/BDEcr3B.png) looks like trouble.

Back to Yoshiwarafor this other lady, Suzuran. Of course she wants to meet the savior, who wouldn't? [Gin, stop being bashful,](http://i.imgur.com/9MFwlDk.png) it's weird. She's... older than I expectedandI'm guessing Gin's in the same situation.

A decades-old promise, eh? Time to investigate! [D'aww, tsun-Tsu-ki.](http://i.imgur.com/wbrevyd.png) [Great](http://i.imgur.com/aPaKvNz.png) [expressions](http://i.imgur.com/Y96bq1d.png) [for](http://i.imgur.com/lQOhPaG.png) [her.](http://i.imgur.com/HJAys7x.png)

The guy they're after is apparently the former shogun; I guess they need to keep increasing the stakes for major story arcs. ^(Though I'm not sure anything can top threatening to replace the entire anime with a different series.)Sadasada? Who names these shoguns and why do they like repetition?

[More than 240 episodes later...](http://i.imgur.com/2GQb6It.png) I wonder if they were just waiting for an excuse touse Kagura's connection with the princess established back in *episode 14*. I love [Gin's confused face.](http://i.imgur.com/Jpt6Vf0.png) And of course another glasses joke, Shinpachi can't get away from those.

Saskai's here! I guess that explains Nobume in the OP. Makes sense that they'd be guarding the shogun and family. [Kinky old geezer I guess.](http://i.imgur.com/2Lsa5W5.png) I think this episode sets a new record for shortest time between introducing the shogun and humiliating him. [Nice job, Gin.](http://i.imgur.com/02HCFZ7.png)

Huh, different art style for the ED with the outlines. I kinda like it. The song, not so much.

---
**Ep. 258** - No, Nobume, you don't get to slice up the shogun.[Nice job](http://i.imgur.com/3ERYu4Y.png) with the "Weekend at Shigeshige's" improvising.The old man's name is Rotten? That's terrible, no wonder he's fine with everyone calling him Grampy.

The Mimawarigumi are plotting with the Hitotsubashi family to put their own shogun in power? Forget that for now, Sadasada was just using Suzuran to assassinate other officials? That must have been awful for her. I guess he's the villain for the arc.

Time for some action, but [Sasaki is awfully nonchalant about being stabbed.](http://i.imgur.com/iq2ACiP.png) Ooh, Sadasada's going to pass any blame on to the intruders. Shrewd. Shinsengumi time!

Sougo, you do *not* wave a donut at Nobume [if you want to keep your limbs intact.](http://i.imgur.com/Gytl33C.png) Interesting discussion between Kondo and Hijikata there; for all his weird stalker tendencies Kondo can still somehow take the moral high ground.

Soyo's story time, and of course it's going to be relevant to the arc. Would be kinda funny if it was Katsura-level rambling though. It was Grampy all along, eh? Not particularly surprisedbut good to know.

Oooh, [Shinsengumi on their side.](http://i.imgur.com/dPLkWi7.png) Or at least turning a blind eye to them. Are they really about to [start a coup?](http://i.imgur.com/CqmxXX5.png) [Again, Futurama.](http://i.imgur.com/2lZ57cE.png) Please don't make a promise you can't keep, folks.

**Ep. 259** - [KAGURAAAAAAA](http://i.imgur.com/0BcpASQ.png)-[CHAN](http://i.imgur.com/LHe3gh2.png) and [straight man Shinpachi.](http://i.imgur.com/InCK1vK.png)

Weird time to bring up sexism but [let's run with it.](http://i.imgur.com/Ph9wbSV.png) [You](http://i.imgur.com/ZnhjreO.png) [go](http://i.imgur.com/yUa4rIY.png) [ladies!](http://i.imgur.com/JvOfRcW.png)

Zazami Original? I don't get it. Anyway, fun to see the crew in action. Wall running! [Kagura hits one out of the park!](http://i.imgur.com/sq89mCY.png) And she throws Shinpachi into one of the cannons, heh.That was a fantastic action sequence, possibly my favorite in the series (maybe after Gin's fight with Jiraia).

[Tsukuyo's having none of Sadasada's shit](http://i.imgur.com/ugSnJzK.png) but he has another army at hand. Tensoin Naraku? Eh, I've heard better. Quick, someone give Grampy a hand. ^(Or two.)

Dual meaning about the moon never falling, bringing back a bit of Tsukuyo's imagery as the moon of Yoshiwara.

Oboro... Gin fought him before. Oooh, backstory for Gin. They're the ones that captured and killed Gin's teacher?Now it's personal. Wonder if Katsura will get involved now, considering he was in the OP (granted, so was Kyubei but I doubt she'll show up for this one). Sakamoto and Takasugi would also made for interesting options.

Mimawarigumi and Shinsengumi here! I'm guessing they're on the same side for once.

---
**Ep. 260** - Nice logic to protect them, Kondo. I'm a fan. Love Kagura and Sougo bickering there.Meanwhile Sasaki shoots Gin with... not his normal gun by the looks of it. Yep, antidote!

So... yeah, full rebellion against Sadasada. I hope Shigeshige stays though, I like him. Woo, Matsudaira's here too, can't leave him out of the fun. SHO-CHAN! Yes, I'm going to call him Sho-chan. Even he's going against his uncle now.

ApparentlySadasada doesn't know when the tide's turned against him. Hm.. the Tendoshu are behind his power? More to that than I'm really aware of right now. I was so hoping that it would be Katsura and Sakamoto on board the ship, but I'll take Nobume and Tsukuyo instead.

Sadasada killed by his own bodyguard, eh? And a nice aerial battle to finish off Oboro. Well, that one felt a lot shorter than 22 minutes.

---
**Ep. 261** - Starting with the ED, you know what that means! Aww, Sadasada's still alive. At least the shogun's not letting the Tendoshu escape with him.Awesome moment for Shigeshige there, too bad it's damaged his reputation enough for him to step down to protect everyone.

Seriously,random Hitotsubashi supporter, [you should know better.](http://i.imgur.com/rzuMNc2.png) Aww, Oboro survived too? Wants to draw outShoyo's students with Sadasada as the bait, I see. And what good bait he is, even drawing [Takasugi](http://i.imgur.com/KoBefOU.png)out of hiding!

Ooooh, Nobume was in the Naraku before joining Sasaki? I wonder why she's so loyal to him now (aside from the donuts). Shigeshige remains the shogun, yay! And [another fantastic face from Tsukuyo.](http://i.imgur.com/pdApYdT.png) Fun to see everyone banding together to get Maizo out to see Suzuran [one final time.](http://i.imgur.com/44KTFQX.png)

---
A very strong arc but I can't say it's my favorite. No particular reason, just nothing standing out that makes me love it as much as I did the Four Devas or Red Spider arcs.All of the short clips at the end of the episodes about the movie were kinda amusing but felt a little out of place in the middle of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
>Sadasada killed by his own bodyguard, eh?

Pretty sure that was Takasugi, source being that I can recognize that sultry-but-psycho voice anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
Right, that was just when I thought Sadasada died in the smoke on the ship. Turns out he survived that and then Takasugi found him.
>> ARTICLE
>  Great expressions for her.

This arc had plenty of Tsukky, something which I will not complain about.

I was surprised that I remember her character at all considering how long its been.

That is the face of my nightmares.

[HA!](http://i.imgur.com/nxZxY9n.jpg)

> Fun to see everyone banding together to get Maizo out to see Suzuran one final time.

Even though most of the arc didn't sink in since I watched most of it while I was sleepy the ending was really well done.

To me that was the ED. It was just *too* light-hearted for my taste.

Part of me wants to believe that Sorachi has a master diagram or resource sheet for those details. Part of me wants to believe that he doesn't and that he gets his assistants to manage and query that data.

I object to this numbering for the OPs.  If only because it glosses over the difference between Gintama and Gintama' and Gintama' Enchousen.  When you go to add Gintama to your MAL, do you add just Gintama?  Or do you have to add a bunch of other things?  (   )

It also ignores the existence of Yorinuki Gintama-san, which had four stellar OPs as well:

The Elite are honestly the worst.  Almost as bad as Hard Boiled Detective.  I just really hate them, they're so boring! (Which is ironic, becuase the current arc in the Gintama manga stars both, and is actually really good.)

Hey OP, I just noticed that you marked the Beam Saber arc wrong in the Google Spreadsheet. It's only 262-264, episode 265 is a stand-alone episode.

fixed now
>> ARTICLE
I should probably watch this show.

Meanwhile I'm just reaffirming my belief that people who have voted this crack to the top of MAL are insane and this is one of the stupidest looking pieces of crap ever made. >_>
>> ARTICLE
I'd definitely watch it (it seems very funny) if it didn't already have so many episodes...
>> ARTICLE
It's very arc based and has many standalone episodes. There is little continuity so no real rush to complete it. 
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. It's just overwhelming to think about starting such a long-running show when I have enough to watch as it is :P
>> ARTICLE
I wish it had more episodes. (Sunrise please)
>> ARTICLE
That's the best part.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty new to anime and I'm avoiding everything with a large amount of episodes just because I could watch so many more low-episode anime in the same amount of time.

I'll eventually hit a point where I think I'm ready, but I still have so many "classics" to watch.

Which sucks, because there are a few high-episode anime I want to watch (Gintama is at the top) but I don't have enough time...
>> ARTICLE
It's a bit overwhelming for someone who has enough other stuff to watch as it is.

It's mostly episodic, not something you should really marathon anyways.

Just finished episode 17 and I never want it to end.

Damn, if your enjoying it that early then you really are gonna love it.
Doesn't even get started until like episode 20+ IMO.

Shit gets real at episode 58. After that you really can't drop it. Have fun !
>> ARTICLE
I finished everything but the Be Forever Yorozuya movie. I'm saving that so I can still savour this series.
>> ARTICLE
Damn if you are loving it that much this early on then once you get deeper into the series it will probably just be your favorite anime ever. Even though the start is great content it just gets so much better later on, especially once you have strong attachments to the characters. 

Like my 3 favorite characters in all anime are from Gintama. 
>> ARTICLE
I cant even start this anime, everytime the dog bites main character i get disgusted, i dunno why it just makes me want to puke and i watched whole elfen lied. o.o
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly what happened to me. I don't really understand why people said things like, *"there's a 15-20 episode hurdle you have to get through, but then after that it gets better."* For me, and I guess it might have to do with the fact that I'm a pretty easily entertained person, I just kinda fell in love with Gintama right off the bat.

Now I can't stop watching Gintama clips off youtube, I just can't stop thinking about Gintama, It's like *"How come I only just seen this anime now, and not when it was airing"*. To be honest, I think if I actually was watching it when it aired I would have died waiting for a new episode EVERY week.

I even felt extremely conflicted with where I should rank Gintama on my personal list. So, I felt like cheating and just saying, *"screw it."* I'll put Gintama above ALL else in its own category where there is no *"First, second, third"* because its the best and there's no competition for it.

Yea, long story short, Gintama was probably the most influential, motivating, heart-warming, soul-crushing, sake-draining, hilarious, *"Literally dying choking on my food because I can't stop laughing"* anime I've seen in...probably ~~the last 5 years or so.~~ Ever.
>> ARTICLE
I, uh...

Well...

So you're saying I should watch it?
>> ARTICLE
You say Gintama so many times it stops sounding like a word.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Gintama stands on its own pedestal. It's like, whenever I rank anime, I almost don't even consider Gintama because it will always be rank #1, and its basically in a league of its own. It transcends the enjoyment I receive from other anime. I can guarantee that there will never be a series that dethrones Gintama's #1 spot for me.
>> ARTICLE
is it just comedy or does it get serious?
>> ARTICLE
You'll just tons of super comedy filled episodes and then out of nowhere you'll get a super serious arc that will have you questioning what anime your watching. It's good though.

its about 85-90% comedy, 10-15% serious.

Depends on what you normally enjoy. Gintama is unique in that it encompasses every anime genre and cliche there is at one point or another. If you like action then the Benizakura arc (which was made into a standalone movie) is great, as well as the second movie. Also, in that same vein, the Four Devas arc is pretty intense. Since you've been bored with the  first episodes, I'm going to assume you don't like the comedy based anime, but yeah, again, just depends on what you like and whether or not you mind skipping episodes you don't like and missing some of the story or character development.

Only the first movie is dubbed, dick jokes aren't the reason though. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. There's a lot of anime that I'd like to watch but since I have to multitask, subbed stuff has to stay off my list. Sad.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that sucks. I hope you get some free time in the future to watch this, or any other sub.

That Kamui Goku reference was awesome!

Okita went toe to toe with one of the strongest members of the Yato clan? 
>> ARTICLE
It was like they are dealing the same damage to each other but one has like 100 times HP compared to the other.
>> ARTICLE
100 seems like an exaggeration. Okita is the strongest in the Shinsengumi after all, and Gintoki has already demonstrated that humans can hold a distant hope against powerful Yato members.
>> ARTICLE
Gintoki + Tsukki + like 50 of the Hyakka can take a single powerful Yato (assuming there's sunlight around to throw him into).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but that's approximately 1.06 Gintokis.

0.059 being Tsukiko.

Banana for comparison?

I'd wanna see that scene.

[Fight between Okita and Kamui.](https://my.mixtape.moe/rdsnpc.webm)

So fucking epic! Never thought that we would see these 2 fighting against each other.

This episode had also probably the most serious Sh-Shogun Kayoooo! scene ever.

Fantastic episode.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched this fight about 20 times already. [So damn good!](http://i.imgur.com/kiEvJIf.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I was like 'oh shit Okita's gonna die! I don't want him to die!' and then I was like 'but if Okita wins that's wrong.. i mean, that's fucking Kamui!!!'
>> ARTICLE
that's exactly what i feel the first time i read that chapter, i was so afraid to turn to the next page.. But after fight with and survive, i'm sure now Okita could handle many villains.. :D
>> ARTICLE
Okita wouldn't die. He's been #1 in popularity as far back as I can remember.

Edit: #2, I mean. Hard to count Gintoki because it's essentially guaranteed.
>> ARTICLE
Okita is the strongest member of the Shinsengumi, by far and he has been shown to even be able to go kinda head to head with Gintoki (All out Gintoki still probably stronger but its quite a feat from Okita), soooooo yea he won't die THAT quickly don't worry :)
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it's Jirocho > Okita > Gin ~= Zura ~= Kondo > Toshi if we're only counting samurai.
>> ARTICLE
More like Jirocho ~= Gin ~= Okita > Zura = Toshi > Kondo . . . with Okita maybe barely behind Gin and Gin barely behind Jirocho, but it depends on the circumstances. Okita's performance against Kamui, a guy who is stronger than the King of the Night, puts him in the top echelons. It's hard to say whether Gin got his ass handed to him by Jirocho the first time because Jirocho was stronger or because Gin was off his rocker (and not using a real sword). 
>> ARTICLE
You are underestimating Zura, not to spoil anything but he becomes pretty nuts in the manga...

And I'd say that Gin is slighty above Okita based on experience, and he has shown that he can push himself to unimaginable levels!
>> ARTICLE
Looking forward to some epic Zura, I'm just basing that on the fact that so far he's pretty much only been seen slaughtering hordes of weaklings, and because him and Toshi are perennial rivals. It's not like Toshi is weak, though, he's just not on the same level as Okita and Gin.
>> ARTICLE
Zura janai Katsura da!
>> ARTICLE
what are you talking about? okita is not the strongest by far :). they were mentioned in the question corner. sorachi already answered. wait i will copy it here:

<Question from Mom, Sunny-Side Up is Good with Soy Sauce>

Whos the strongest: Kondo, Hijikata or Okita?  Hijikata has defeated Okita, and Kondo has beaten Tojo, right?  So who is it?

Strength is a tricky thing.  Between two more or less equally matched opponents, mental conditioning is more important.  I suppose a really strong person can use his or her power effectively regardless of mood or attitude, but at the elite level, subtle differences often determine the outcome of a fight.  So I cant say whos number one with certainty, but when it comes to swordplay, Okita is the best.

Gintama Vol. 16

he just said, that in terms of swordplay he is the best. but that doesn't mean he would win against hijikata or kondo.
>> ARTICLE
But in the Okita-Sister arc it was mentioned that Okita almost never looses when fighting against Hijikata, sure you can't say who will win 100% of the time but out of them all in a Swordfight Okita is the one that is most likely to win.

It has been said again and again, same with the Sword in Ass arc 
>> ARTICLE
in the okita arc kondo just said: " its unusual that you lose". i dont think he meant fighting perse. more like all the shit he is pulling with hijikata. i think it is  like sorachi said. they are more or less equally matched. okita may have an advantage because of his better swordskills, but saying he is the strongest by far is not right.
it also was mentioned that hijikata has the best intuition in fighting.
now it is arguable what is more usefull in a fight.
>> ARTICLE
[Favorite screencap of that fight.](http://i.imgur.com/9Z1eWXg.jpg) It happened so fast, I almost didn't notice Okita attacking with the kunai still impaled in his hand. That's pretty badass.
>> ARTICLE
I wish they spent a bit more time on that scene in slow motion or something, you can't even see what's happening in the anime but it's very clear in the manga. Sougo trying to stab him with a kunai that's stabbed in his hand is so bad-ass 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's just one of the tradeoffs between manga and anime formats. In manga, readers can enjoy all the details of each panel at their own pace. In anime, the director/animators control the pace. I love how frantic and fluid the anime version feels though + the OST.

Who knows? They might polish that scene up for the blu-rays and/or theatrical release if they ever make one (like they did for the Benizakura arc).
>> ARTICLE
Woohoo! I finally caught up to Gintama last week but this is my first discussion thread. And hot damn did I pick a doozy of an episode. The shogun's dead! Zenzo's a traitor! Nope, jk he's a double agent! Okita vs. Kamui! Ninja village! But wait...***SHOOOOGUN KAYOOOOOO***
>> ARTICLE
I had already accepted that we'd never see another episode full of puns at the expenses of the shogun, but that ending brought tears of joy to my eyes.
>> ARTICLE
welcome to the club :D
>> ARTICLE
Now I can finally understand what the manga readers meant by that on the other gintama episode discussions
>> ARTICLE
fuck me i really thought sougo was about to die... i fucking love this
>> ARTICLE
Tricky bastard, throwin' hands around... Playin' with our hearts like shiiitttt
>> ARTICLE
that death flag omg
>> ARTICLE
There weren't any death flags.
>> ARTICLE
there is, that line he said when we were against Kamui and everyone after the explosion. normally the last line been said before getting rekted and died in honour.

edit: added 'after the explosion' to make it clearer
>> ARTICLE
The only deathflags in Gintama are those when the enemy end up changing sides and regretting their actions.Standard anime deathflags (for main characters) don't apply in Gintama,only those for antagonists do.

Everything is happening very quickly

now that im seeing the past of zenzo, sarutobi and the shogun im actually quite interested in it, figured i only wanted to know gin's past but guess not
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader, all I will say is that Gintoki's past will be extended in this arc, and it will connect back to some of the implications in the Shinigami arc. 
>> ARTICLE
can't believe we have to wait another week, this is painful

[MFW Okita vs Kamui](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view5/2616332/spongebob-eating-hands-o.gif)

Takasugi entering the fray slaying chumps while his theme was playing was fucking badass

Dat piano key roll when the white dressed ninjas coming to fight

Man, this arc has been full of teases of betrayal and full betrayal itself so far. Very Game of Thrones-esque and leaves you wanting for more

Second episode of the arc and the hype is still on full blast
>> ARTICLE
I was just about to accept the loss of the shogun as this episode was ending, very glad I didnt have to. 

I also saw Abuto with both his arms in the preview, whats up with that??


>> ARTICLE
iirc he got a prosthetic just like Umibozu
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of, i'm kinda hoping he shows up and kicks some ass
>> ARTICLE
The dream: Umibozu going head to head with Abuto and Kamui at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
Nup the dream is Umibozu vs someone who will not named due to huge spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD, i'm like 13 minutes into the episode, but i just needed to express my feelings.

Edit: So first i'd like to say that this episode blew my expectations out of the water. Honestly Bandai Namco Pictures did pretty much every single amazing scene in the manga justice and actually made the fights even better....animation was freaking beautiful.

My highlights:

-I found the way the Shoguns corpse was twitching as it lay on the ground, really really creepy.

-Hattori's eyes are perfection, so i was happy to see they did the scene on the airship perfectly, giving him this demonic vibe

-God, i was laughing hard when Hattori and Sacchan's teacher started pelting kunai through the wall to Hattori's surprise

-Gintoki, Kagura and Shinpachi.....please never become political figures of any kind xD

-Sacchan had too many great moments, from her detecting the betrayal to her show of intelligence, at working out who was behind everything

-Probably one of the only scenes that could have been slightly better was takasugi's scene, where he rips into the ninja. It had more impact in the manga.

-DAMN YOU Horrible Subs!!! You changed Kamui's best line "i'm one hell of a villain" to a "heinous criminal"....like come on...

-Hijikata and Kondo fighting was badass

-Now for the main event....KAMUI VS OKITA...like holy shit. This fight, while short, still puts most shonen anime to shame. The animation was godly and the way the camera moved fluidly throughout the fight, was something Bandai Namco Pictures did that enhanced it soooo much.

-The preview for the next episode is looking really good....especially Hattori's eyes...they are very important to us manga readers, trust me.
>> ARTICLE
yap that shogun corpse twitching is very creepy! 
>> ARTICLE
Does Kamui actually say "one hell of a villain" though? I did a rewatch of the scene and he says something like "ore wa (something beginning with what sounds like tobiku but I can't make it out) da yo". "One hell of a villain" would seem to be a reference to Sebastian's catchphrase in Kuroshitsuji: "I'm simply one hell of a butler". This is a pun in Japanese that actually means "I am a demon and a butler", and goes "aku made shitsuji desu" (which the Gintama wikia tries to make a connection to in the Lesson 505 trivia). But that doesn't sound at all like what Kamui says (different pronoun usage, da yo vs desu etc.), so I don't think it's a reference, and I think Crunchyroll's "heinous villain" *may* be more accurate in that regard.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong though! I don't speak Japanese, so I can't vouch for whether his wording would translate better as 'criminal' or 'villain', though the police officer vs criminal dynamic would fit more in my view.
>> ARTICLE
Oh...well i like the other translation better anyways.
>> ARTICLE
I'm completely clueless with Japanese, but what I really liked about Kamui's 'one hell of a villain' translation is that it kind of plays on what Kagura said about Okita back in the Okita Death Flag arc (according to the CR subs there, she says 'you're one hell of a killer'). When I read the manga I kind of thought of that and the parallel with what Kamui is saying now was pretty cool. I'm not sure if what she says reflects with Kamui's line here, though.
>> ARTICLE
Ah I completely forgot that line! That does work well. I do think I prefer the police-criminal thing they have going on with Crunchy's translation, since it seemed to be a running theme throughout the fight (and the antithesis of a villain would more be a "hero", which Okita arguably isn't since Kamui is saying he's a killer etc.), but the other does relate back well. Ideally I'd love a literal word for word breakdown of what he said (like a gloss in linguistics)  to see which words he's actually using, but that's just me haha.

I haven't read that far in the manga yet- I'm reading through the Viz physical volumes until they run out (around 20-something I think) first- so I have no idea what the quality of the fan translation is like overall and how many liberties they take etc. 
>> ARTICLE
Jup has more impact!

http://imgur.com/lZI2vpL

And yes I have every single chapter saved on my computer :0

EDIT: Ohh and btw, its still the same team working on everything, they just switched studios right?

Does anyone know the reason they did that?
>> ARTICLE
Well technically it's still Sunrise. Bandai Namco Pictures are just a smaller studio created by Sunrise to produce "series made for children"......cue hysterical laughter. 
>> ARTICLE
Series made for children as a headless corpse's hands twitch in death throes.
>> ARTICLE
They changed Takasugi's tofu line to butter too. I really liked him saying tofu. X'DDD
>> ARTICLE
That fight was intense! Sort of wished it was a little longer tho. Really praying for those two to have a rematch in the future.
>> ARTICLE
I think they'll finally end Kamui by having him fight Sogo and Kagura at the same time, but cause of new events happening in the manga, shit's getting complicated
>> ARTICLE
*Sh-shogun Kayooooo!!!*

Classic Gintama with an entirely different atmosphere. That being said- episode was fucking intense. Plot twistS, fight sceneS, flashback and of course small bits of humour. My cheeks are actually flushed as I'm typing this that's how worked up I am lol.
>> ARTICLE
This is first time in quite a while that I've _really_ been looking forward to Gintama episodes. 

I hope you all have a [beautiful day.](http://webm.host/e0237/vid.webm)

[Young Saachan's quite cute.](http://i.imgur.com/HBQVdiI.png)

I'm always impressed at how Sorachi finds a way to throw in something funny even with all the serious stuff that happens.

Its nice to see Zenzou getting the spotlight. I figured that he would just be a recurring gag character even knowing his backstory.

[Takasugi, looking suave as always.](http://i.imgur.com/0SekcF2.png)

Okita's entrance was quite something, god damn!

Then there's the main event between [Okita](http://i.imgur.com/wJvfDLk.png) and [Kamui](http://i.imgur.com/xBdMyOw.png)... such a good fight and we're only in the 2nd episode?! If this is what we have so early then I'm looking forward to what's coming in the future.

[Kondo's getting his cool moment too.](http://i.imgur.com/irlMMkI.png)

SHOGUN KA YO!?!? Great way to end things, on a huge cliffhanger/twist. 

Damn it Zenzou, stop making it hard to figure out your motivations!

From the looks of things we're only just getting started. This is going to be quite the story arc when its all over.
>> ARTICLE
Aaaaaah more young Sacchan! And I don't know who the other woman talking to her is but I want to know more about her too.

Well damn, I never thought I'd see Sougo vs. Kamui and that's one epic battle... that's not over yet.

Seems like Shigeshige had *everyone* fooled ^(called it) but I have to wonder what part Zenzo's playing then.
>> ARTICLE
I think that woman is the one from one of the early episode when they went to rescue Elizabeth as ninjas.
>> ARTICLE
She also attended Zenzou's dad's funeral. She went to ninja school with Zenzou and Sacchan.
>> ARTICLE
SHOGUN KAYOOOO?!
>> ARTICLE
The animation for this episode is so good! Really great to see the fighting scenes animated so nicely. The stillness before Okita and Kamui started fighting really ramped up the tension A LOT.

I like how they added little touches (twitching hands of the dead fake!shogun etc.), brings something more to the anime than what is exactly in the manga.

Today's transitions are also smoother than the previous one. The little funny bits (kagura's TOSHII) also didn't feel out of place
>> ARTICLE
Sogo fighting the OTP's bro Kamui was hype as fuck

Things will sure be awkward if they ever become in-laws


>> ARTICLE
As someone whose up to date with the manga, seeing everything get animated is so amazingly beautiful. I think they captured the reveal at the end really well. I do have to admit that I think the manga captured the tension and deviousness of the Okita vs Kamui fight a bit better, but watching it was still glorious.

For those interested, [here's the manga version of the Okita vs Kamui fight with the Four Devas theme music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAay3_pyHcw). Don't let your eyes wander to the related videos though, as there may be a few spoilers for upcoming episodes.

EDIT: Rewatching the fight a couple of times, I take back what I said about my preference - I think they did the manga total justice.
>> ARTICLE
Could please tell me at what volume shogun assination arc starts?
>> ARTICLE
The wiki says volume 56 and it starts on chapter 502.

Okita's deviousness was the best part of the fight. Really like how each character's fighting style fits their personality.

Yet the shogun is not dead apparently. Though I can imagine him still dying at some point into this arc.

believe me, we're still at the tip of the said darkness

But I hope they have a paus between this arc and the next to just adapt the 30+ chapters they haven't adapted yet.

i sure do hope so. or else they'll stuck taking another hiatus/doing reruns right after the next arc; the current running arc in the manga is pretty long

I knew the shogun couldn't have died so quickly, and that probably means an awesome plan by Zenzo to fake the death(hopefully). Kamui vs Sougo,so amazing,I wish it was longer. The scene at the end, just makes me want the next ep so badly.

one of my favorite fights in the series. any other anime would have dragged it out and had pauses between each of their exchanges, so it was awesome to just see a balls to wall full throttle 60 seconds of bloody action. annoyed me that the CR subs had Kamui saying "im one heineous villain" instead of "im one hell of a villain," but it was still amazing.

I've never rewind anything as many times as I did with this episode, holy fucking christ! I really really love this serious, bloody, well animated and choreographed fights.

 I really love the OP and how it, well, absurdly meshes with the arc.

Now, let me qualify that statement. I've seen lots of comments and even a few posts that find the OP jarring and in some ways distasteful with the arc that is ongoing. I, however, cannot get enough of it.

With the comedy chapters that were covered with this going on, it felt fitting and worked. I love it even more now that it has been adjusted for this arc, and it has this odd vibe about it that gets me cheery for something titled "Shogun Assassination Arc".

The section of the song that leads in with the "Jump Jump Jump!" and goes to the end, I think, encapsulates what I really enjoy about Gintama the most. The way the song enters this ecstatic, rose-tinted world that just clashes with the visuals going on says to me, "Remember how two weeks ago we were making fun of Dragon Quest? Or what about that time four guys had a war of mind games on the toilet? Oh oh, remember that time they tried to show the Shogun a good time at a cabaret club? Or the pool? Haha, yeah, well here's this now." It works because Gintama is, as always mentioned, this comedy-action-thriller-tragedy-sliceoflife-chanbara-slapstick-scifi series, and that part of the OP serves to remind of that.

Plus! It acts as a sort of rise, or lead in for what's to come. As much as I love it,  DOES is doing the next OP and that's just perfect. Maybe this OP is speaking to us directly. Born too late to explore the world, born too early to explore space, but born just in time to see Shogun Assassination Arc animated and airing. Hell, we're all living in these Beautiful Days.

Although I mentioned the criticism I've seen over this OP, this isn't meant to argue against those opinions or disagree, because they're just as right as mine. I just really love how this OP has turned out. 
>> ARTICLE
The previous scenes in the OP made it obnoxious,but as soon as they changed it I started to like it myself especially since the scenes actually have more of a connection to the current arc.
>> ARTICLE
>Hell, we're all living in these Beautiful Days.

>Hell, we're all living in these Glorious Days.  

I got you.

That was an INTENSE fight ! I still have goosebumps.

>the Gorilla is the Leader

You just noticed..
>> ARTICLE
I will probably get shit for this. But I have wanted to get into the show for a while. Does it get serious or is it a comedy throughout. Like other shows with the humor and what not but can have serious story too.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, it's all comedy. If you're not into the comedy genre, you most likely won't enjoy Gintama. The current arc that's airing 'the Shogun Assassination' arc has some of the funniest comedy out there.
>> ARTICLE
The majority (~60%? more so in earlier seasons) are one or two episode long short stories/gags with a recurring cast. There are elements of comedy throughout, but it is not always the primary focus, especially during some serious arcs.

The main selling points in my opinion is the likeable cast and character interactions. Because of this, I would also advise skipping episodes as it lessens the impact of some of the more serious arcs, such as the current one.

The only real problem with picking up Gintama is that you probably need to invest at least 30 or so episodes before making any decisions on it, general consensus is that it gets better as you watch it and a small sample of episodes is not enough to see whether or not it is worth the time invested.
>> ARTICLE
It's comedy throughout the entire thing with serious arcs mixed in throughout it, though currently the manga which the anime is adapted from has been serious for like a year. I absolutely love the serious arcs and all the backstory for the characters but first and foremost Gintama is comedy.
>> ARTICLE
There are quite a bunch of serious arcs which are mostly REALLY good and are normally around 2-8 episodes long, part of what makes Gintama so good is just how well it can transition from dick jokes to being serious without it feeling jarring.
>> ARTICLE
It's a show which is primarily episodic comedy, with 'serious' arcs occurring every so often, then first one beginning at episode 58. There's also a slowly progressing overarching plot, which you could say is climaxing in the currently airing and subsequent arcs. 

Don't watch it solely for the action, because comedy is a major part of it, but give it at try and see what you think, because both the action and comedy are some of the best you'll find in any show. It takes a while to get going, but nearly anyone who's watched it will tell you that it's worth it. 
>> ARTICLE
just to add:

a good number of those comedic, episodic episodes/arcs will still catch your feels off-guard. it's a real roller-coaster, which is why most people who enjoyed it, loved it.

if i have to put it simply, the comedic arcs mostly deals with human interactions/bonds and satirical stuffs while the serious arcs focuses on the real underlying plot and fleshing out the main and plot-related characters.

Does anybody have the clip where Okita kicked all those samurai's ass? That was pretty awesome. Also can't wait for next episode so hyped!!!!!!!

That episode was truly the best, loved every second of it!

THIS FUCKING EPISODE

THIS FUCKING ARC

THERE IS NO BRAKE
>> ARTICLE
You mean - THE PENILE BRAKE. :v
>> ARTICLE
I loved this episode but I really feel they should slow down a bit. The shock factor of dead shogun was over in 1 episode which reduced the impact of his "death".
>> ARTICLE
yup, like xero said, the arc's barely started. there's bound to be something even far more interesting than zenzou's cover-up assassination
>> ARTICLE
Gintama isn't a story-heavy anime.Why would they drag it on for so long?Besides,the manga chapters come out once a week aka at the same rate as the anime episodes so what just got shown in one week originally took 3 weeks.Besides,it was clear that this would be a serious and lengthy arc just by looking at previews and the arc's name,he wouldn't die the first episode into it.
>> ARTICLE
That fight between Okita and Kamui gave me shivers. 

By the way people who have read the manga, how long do you expect this arc to go on for.
>> ARTICLE
[As of right now if they continue the 2 chapters per episode](/s ", at least 30+ episodes. Technically this arc will last around 12-13 episodes but it goes straight into the next arc which leads into a third arc which is still on going in the manga. Of course they might just go back and air some of the chapters from before this arc that they didn't adapt to take a break in between serious arcs.")

>> ARTICLE
i'm speculating that this will probably go up to right before the aftermath of shogun's assassination arc. then they'll  air the unadapted non-serious-arc manga chapters [Spoiler](/s "because if they dont do them by that time, it'll be too late; the arc's conclusion mood lash is so dark, you can never go back to the old gintama") while waiting for enough material from current running arc in the manga, then continuing the anime with this arc's conclusion [Spoiler](/s "which transitions very well into the 'farewell shinsengumi' arc.")
>> ARTICLE
This episode covered 3 whole chapters and the preview to the next ones shows it will cover 3+ chapters as well, I'd say 9 episodes
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling it might be 10 because there's two chapters which i think will be in only one episode.....it's "those" chapters
>> ARTICLE
8-10 episodes

Wait, how did Toshi and Kondo have the time to get into their disguises? Weren't they shown fighting the IGA ninjas just a few minutes earlier in the episode?
>> ARTICLE
Will be explained (kinda) in the next episode.

[For those that don't want to wait](/s "half the ninjas belong to Momochi and the other half to Fujibayashi, Momochi's ninjas helped out Toshi and Kondou.")
>> ARTICLE
Not every one of the ninjas were traitors as clearly shown at the end.Now use your brain and think about it,when the Shogun was dressed up.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, that didn't explain it at all. In one scene, they were shown wearing different outfits and fighting the ninjas. A few minutes later, they somehow managed to put on disguises and blend in with the rest of the ninjas without the ninja leader noticing. 

This happened over a few chapters in the manga. In the anime, it all happened in a single episode. I don't think the the author intended for the reveal to occur in the same episode. 
>> ARTICLE
>Not every one of the ninjas were traitors

If there are nnjas in white that are also on their side then they could easily slip in.Kill enemies>make contact with the ninjas in white that are on their side>get suits that they clearly planned to have (not gonna explain as it already was in the episode)>join the allied ninjas in white>act as enemy ninjas>blah blah.Use your brain to think about it.
>> ARTICLE
it's most likely that shigeshige himself foresaw that this would happen and prepared the disguises for him, hijikata and kondo in advance, with him donning the disguise from the start and possibly, carried the other two's disguise uniform. the fact that he's already dressed up and blended in with the combatants unnoticed is obviously planned all along thus he's in the perfect position to execute this kind of swap. happened too fast? he's a ninja after all :v

Okay?          
You're the one missing out on all this action,not me.          
I still don't get why people deny to watch a show just because there's a lot of episode,just watch a few episode and see if you like it and if you do,than watch it at your own pace.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I was telling you that you're missing out on any action in the first place?

Following a story that goes on for over 7000 hours will definitely put a huge dent on time I can spend on doing/watching something else. It would also take a big chunk of my disk space.

>Following a story that goes on for over 7000 hours will definitely put a huge dent on time I can spend on doing/watching something else. It would also take a big chunk of my disk space.              
              
That's the mentality i was talking about,when you watch a anime,you don't need to substitute out any of your other work for it.All you need to do is to check if you like it and if you do,start watching it at your own pace.                 
You don't need the mentality of binging it,just watch it like every other new anime or something.              
Well,it's fine if you don't watch it,i just wanted to introduce a good anime to a fellow redditor,since he's missing out.
>> ARTICLE
I mean I get what you're trying to do, but being condescending about it with your "I still don't get why people feel overwhelmed by something obviously overwhelming" talk pisses me off.

1. Disk space: 300 episodes is huge.
2. Data cap: I don't have the privilege of having unlimited internet.
3. Slow internet: You've probably already guessed this on #2. Downloading all that will take me a very very long time.
4. Tendency to binge shows I like: This is my pace. I finished some 24 minute shows in one sitting simply because I liked them. If I end up liking this show, this is my fate.
5. Tendency to try to complete shows: I don't like dropping shows. Starting this means dedicating myself to finishing it, regardless of whether I like it or not.

But I understand that this is a Gintama thread and I shouldn't have posted anyway in the first place, so lesson learned. Expect no further post from me.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why this comment was downvoted, sure, it's irrelevant but you're at least being reasonable.
>> ARTICLE
But...he's not being reasonable, at all. All of his complaints have very simple and convenient ways around them. *That's* the reason people are downvoting it and calling his "reason" stupid, which it is. He's just coming up with excuses because he probably just doesn't like shounen, which is, in all honesty, a much better reason than the list he gave.

It's this prevailing attitude that causes people to miss out on some of the best shows produced. Gundam, Gintama, and most of One Piece being at the top. Other than length, what do they have in common? They're shounen.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite anime is Hunter x Hunter. I'm not sure what made you think I don't like shounen, or how your logic (or lack thereof) for coming up with this accusation is less stupid than me deciding to not watch a show because of its length, but I'd really love to hear your simple and convenient ways on how I can get around the restrictions of my data cap and my slow internet.
>> ARTICLE
Simple and convenient ways? Careful selection, not choosing anything above 480p, proper resource management, and just plain simple thoughtful judgment as to what you want. All of these factors can easily work out slow, intermittent internet speed and data cap. There are plenty of shows that are 80 megs or so that can be gotten, and if you haven't noticed them I'm telling you now of their existence. Stop looking for super high-res and you'll find a plethora of shows you can watch. If you're focused too much on quality of media, then you're never going to get anywhere with your connection. Basically, get used to low res.

Because you haven't even brought it up, nor considered it as an option is in and of itself stupid. That's the definition. Ignoring the solution in favor of something you can't attain. You take it as a personal attack, but it's just your way of thinking you can't do things that makes it stupid.

That and your pity party-esque attitude that no one understands your situation. We get it, but you going on and on about it is, bluntly, stupid because of the fact that there are several solutions you can go through that you simply *don't*. Get over yourself.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, choosing not to watch the 300+ episode anime Gintama with my current circumstances doesn't fall under careful selection, proper resource management, and simple thoughtful judgment? I've gotten by with watching and enjoying anime with my circumstances, so I don't think I have to get used to low res just so I can watch long anime.

Choosing lower quality files is an alternative, not a solution. A solution is supposed to remove a problem, and the problem you're suggesting that this "solution" can solve is that I have slow internet, when it doesn't. An alternative that I don't care enough for to take. So I chose another alternative, which is to just not watch one show. I did take it personally because you did attack me personally by making false accusations about me not liking shounen which is completely false. I mean really, I don't know why you have to be aggressive in the first place. You keep calling me and things I do stupid, and I don't know how you think a person's supposed to react to that.

Now you're making new accusations by saying that my attitude is party-esque. I'm not trying to gain any sympathy, I stated my reasons because it was warranted and relevant to the discussion. I keep going on and on about it because you don't seem to get what I'm saying: watching longer shows require too much for me that the cons outweigh the pros. These "solutions" either water down or even completely ignore things that I like to keep when I watch anime, which is why I don't take them.

You seem to be getting angrier and angrier here and you keep escalating the issue of me simply not wanting to watch an anime because of its length. So far, you've accused me of not liking shounen, you've implied that I'm trying to garner pity, and you've said a bunch of other stuff that I can only assume is an elaborate way of calling me stupid and self-centered.
>> ARTICLE
Ignoring your opinion on /u/Smilelele's "excuses", I'll just comment on the second part because the first one is a rabbit hole since it's purely subjective in every way possible.

I think people miss out on those shows much for one big reason, which is because they require a huge time investment, I watched 110~ episodes of One Piece and I only kinda enjoyed it. (but dropped it because I got really bored of the arc I was at and because of the bad pacing)

A lot of people enjoy the non-long-running shonens (Bleach, One Piece, Naruto and HxH aren't the only shonens, the action shonen-genre is very big), I used to be like that, I never really enjoyed long running anime because I didn't have the time to watch them, but once I managed to find it I did explore that space of anime but even then, most long-running anime proved to be unenjoyable for me.

Time is the most valuable resource that you and I have (heh, kinda feels hypocritical to say this after posting a certain thread on /r/anime, recently), I don't think you should forget that it's a huge factor when it comes to the decision-making of everyone.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty clear that you missed the point of what I said. It wasn't about the length being the factor, it's the fact that they're shounen and that's the reason for the dislike. You admitted as much yourself with basically every paragraph you wrote. My point was not that people didn't like them because they were long, but because they were shounen. Which, again, you pretty much laid out in black and white.
>> ARTICLE
Alright alright,i got it.The reason i say stuff like "i don't understand bla bla bla" is because nobody actually point it out unlike you did which i appreciate.               
I'll try not to trouble you anymore but if you have the chance of maybe obtain the ability to watch without any trouble and have unlimited time,i recommend gintama with all my might.
>> ARTICLE
> Disk space: 300 episodes is huge.

I don't think this is particularly relevant - you can just delete it right after you're done watching it if you're really that low on disk space. I have most of the episodes downloaded and it takes up about 90 GB, which is fairly reasonable.

> Tendency to binge shows I like: This is my pace. I finished some 24 minute shows in one sitting simply because I liked them. If I end up liking this show, this is my fate.

This is a problem with your own self-control, not long shows. I also binge watch pretty much every show, but I watched Gintama at a pretty controlled pace. Partly because most of it is episodic and not connected to any over-arching plot, but also because, like you said, it's really long. Even at a rate of 25 episodes a day, it would take 12 days of doing absolutely nothing with your life to finish it.

> Tendency to try to complete shows: I don't like dropping shows. Starting this means dedicating myself to finishing it, regardless of whether I like it or not.

That's not the first time I've heard something like that, but I don't really understand this attitude. Do you not watch television? What happens when you inadvertently watch some episode of a ten season long show? Do you actually go through and watch the entire thing just because you saw one episode while flipping through channels? Do you not realise that life is short and that forcing yourself to spend hours in front of a computer screen watching shows you don't enjoy just so you can check it off as "completed" in your head is *really fucking stupid*? This is really just a personal problem. It has nothing to do with the length of the show.

I am not saying that you should go watch Gintama right now. If you don't want to watch Gintama because you don't like the premise or because all of your friends hated on it, then don't. But discounting it because of its length is just silly.
>> ARTICLE
If you haven't watched One Piece (I don't),pick it up.Have fun with 700+ episodes,you'll know why.Gintama isn't story heavy so jumping around alot isn't bad at all,I know since I did it since I delayed it for years on accident (forgot about the show after I saw the first movie).

Why would that bother you?
>> ARTICLE
One, it's misuse of a translation note. Since it's not actually translating anything. Mostly a semantics problem here that I don't care too much about.

Two, it's explaining a culture reference. What does this add? Explaining it to someone who already knows it makes most people go "Yeah, I know." and roll their eyes at the now fairly ruined joke. Explaining it to someone who doesn't know doesn't suddenly redeem the reference and make it funny again.

Three, it's a fucking reference. By definition, there are going to be people who don't get it. Since it's a reference. People don't go around explaining every meme they quote, now do they?
>> ARTICLE
> Explaining it to someone who doesn't know doesn't suddenly redeem the reference and make it funny again.

It did for me, and probably most of the people who watched it since this is the first time I ever heard this complaint from anyone.
>> ARTICLE
> One, it's misuse of a translation note. Since it's not actually translating anything.

It's translating a cultural concept.  It's weird to have it at the top, but it's not uncommon to see notes from an editor in a translated book.

As for the other stuff, I don't think it's such a big deal.  I missed some of the references and found it helpful.  Maybe just chill out?  You clearly get this stuff already, it's not for you.


>> ARTICLE
But the problem here is that it's a referential joke, which are jokes that are, by nature, going to go over people's heads. Really! Try watching an episode of South Park or Saturday Night Live, and see how many references you're gonna get without googling. 

Hell, look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFIzpaurSGM). Do you see a translation note for a reference that primarily only adult anime fans will get? Pokemon also makes *boatloads* of classic visual references from Ashita no Joe to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, and there aren't translation notes for the dubs there either.

If you want to preserve the integrity of a referential joke, you go as is. 

>It's weird to have it at the top

Pretty standard for anime, actually.
>> ARTICLE
i give you an example a non translator noted scene in gintama, [the press conference announcement before 2015 season come out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPnkJJnla4k)

for a non japanese watcher, we would be clueless of what the heck is happening. thats why those translator help us understand of what is actually happening. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why you would think that because some choose not to, no one should.
>> ARTICLE
Because by nature, referential jokes are gonna go over people's heads? If you wish to convey the same referential joke, you don't put in a note that explains it?

Which is, y'know. The definition of proper translation. You convey the same meaning and intentions.
>> ARTICLE
They aren't explaining the joke though, just the reference.  That's part of translation: here is what this word means in their culture.  

The actual joke is "ha ha, look at this guy doing funny things when no one is around."

Knowing that he is doing a wind up from a particular anime instead of just "an anime" doesn't make it less funny.
>> ARTICLE
No, for each individual cut, the reference *is* the joke. The funny things when nobody is watching is just part of the whole scene's narrative joke, which is separate.

Also, is the culture point even valid? All of these works have been localized to the English language, for the exception of B'z. Therefore, they're also part of English culture as well by extension.

Anyone who watches Gintama can attest it's not flawless (that sudden MS Paint OP anyone?). Hell it seriously knows what its doing and doesn't shy to make fun of its own flaw. The ongoing recommendation that its starts out shitty (assuming you skip ep 1 + 2 which are just pilot episodes) is just standards of comedy. 

Some get hooked right from the beginning. Some get hooked 40+ episodes later. It's really, just standard.

Then again, some may not get hooked even after 120+ episodes (which really, it's not for you if you force yourself to enjoy it up to that point). Don't knock it till you actually try it.

With this week Gintama becomes the show I've watched the most episodes of! I don't envision any other series passing it since all the longer ones are shonen action series and it's not really my thing.

**Episode 62** - This one is fantastic. Nice review of the arc with the song to open, then we get a breather episode with a new(ish) character following up on it. I don't recall if Yamazaki was formally introduced before, but I had been wondering who was the guy playing badminton in the opening credits earlier. After being hit by shuttlecocks the first time and rackets the second, I was suspecting he would get hit by the net and posts the third time. The horse came out of nowhere and had me laughing for a while. Likewise, I was waiting for Yamazaki to run into Kondo stalking Otae, but I didn't expect Sachan to be there too and seeing them interact was great. *This* is why I like the show so much.

**Episode 63** - Ninja pizza delivery! Also Hattori Zenzo and his hemorrhoid issues. Not a lot to say, the clairvoyant girl was cute. New ending with shooting stars, not sure how I feel about it yet.

**Episode 64** - A day with Katsura. I was hoping they would have kept his voice changer when they removed the visual distortion on his face, but alas. That poor reporter woman. I was kinda hoping for her to fall for him at the end, but the bomb as a P.S. also worked.

**Episode 65** - Kagura plays Pokemon! And they run into the Shinsengumi in the forest also trying to catch a beetle, but in this case it's the shogun's pet. I think this is the first time the shogun comes up?

**Episode 66** - _\*ding\* Ah, I saw her undies._ I thought the trio at the guy's table would end up winning other people over to that side, but Gin scared them off and that was good. It then became great when Gin and Shinpachi were stuffed but they set up an assembly line for Kagura.

**Episode 67** - They had a contest? I like Noriko Mach, crazy enough to be more than a match for Gin. Also Gengai returns from way back. The first couple deliveries were fun then it almost turns into a parody of the Speed movies that I was hoping for.

**Episode 67.5** - Oh Sachan, you're unfortunately not very well developed but I love you anyway.

I'll be away next weekend but I might get a writeup prepared in advance.
>> ARTICLE
We have now watched 1/3 of the original series!

Also I have an idea. There're 6 episodes next week and 8 the week after that, with a 6 episode long arc. How about having 8 episodes next week instead? That way the arc gets it's own discussion.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that would probably be better.  
But I don't know if I can change it now that I announced next week's schedule.  
Also episode 74-75 are VERY funny. I doubt they would be forgotten easily.  

I will probably say something that will make us remember 74-75 at the 74-81 discussion thread. 
>> ARTICLE
So after Benizakura it would be my assumption that things will slow back down a little bit. Given the surprising amount of continuity, itd be nice to see some of the after effects of the arc.


**Ep. 62**  Only Gintama would put a full-fledged AMV with footage of the prior arc. I thought that Hijikata and Gin had at least a greater level of familiarity. Does this take place before some of their more recent run-ins? Nope, Yamazaki is montaging his way through every encounter Gin has had. RUNAWAY HORSE! So has Otae successfully restored the dojo if she can afford Fort Mode? Damn, that shot of everyone converging on Gin above the trap was fantastic. 


**Ep. 63**


> What do you have against my butthole?


Forgot how great Zenzu and Gin were together with their JUMP wisdom and butt play. Odd Job secret service best security. This show just cannot have enough bathroom scenes, not that Im complaining or anything. Even cats have their moments of benevolence, eh Zenzu?


**Ep. 64**  I love how the show speculated that Katsura was wearing hair extensions after his run-in with the Kiheitai. Makes me happy to see Katsura hanging out at that Ramen shop from before. It appears that Okita has discovered the joys of sadism as he looks a little too eager with his RPG. TASTY STICK SMOKE BOMB! Since when has the Shinsengumi had a fucking railgun?
 

**Ep. 65**  Ah yes, the Crunchyroll comment section is totally behind Kagura x Okita. Seriously thought this was going to be a Haruhi parody of the cave cricket with that silly CGI. Poor Kagura, but how can you possibly have that much snot to work with? Shinsengumi and Odd Jobs dicking around in a forest. Best episode this week. Oh my god this ridiculous face-off between Kagura and Okita. And perfect conclusion. IT EVOLVED!


**Ep. 66**


> So I have to create a thousand worlds with dango


I like how the show is now sneaking cameos of minor characters like Hedero into theAh, I saw her undies. This Andromeda guy, I swear. I cant. Too ridiculous. Was a little worried about this competition taking up an entire half of the show but Odd Jobs can really draw humor out of anything. Shinpachi taking dango to go. Kagura eating rice while catching dango. Gin fighting off the riffraff from the Sakata family table. The sugar king. Glorious.


**Ep. 67**

> You call that a delivery? I call that terrorism.


So was this My Amanto contest a real thing? I think the winner may have recently re-watched FLCL. Much faster paced than anything else this week, which worked well with the sequence of gags as we moved from character to character.


> You smell more like a woman these days


Never too keen on Sacchan, but man this part was laugh-intensive, from Zenzo and Gin staving off lovestruck-mode Sacchan to the organ-stealing doctor telling Zenzo and Gin that various sensitive areas will explode. And a Misery reference! Those reaction faces though.
>> ARTICLE
This is a rewatch for me, so I know what will happen in the future and what I can expect from Gintama. This week we get a new ending, more lighthearted than the one before. It is one of the worse Ending, but that doesnt mean it is bad.

**Ep 62**: Sort of an Epilog to the Benizakura-Arc with a slow start, but the second half is at least quite amusing, but nothing really more.  Although the recap of the Arc wasnt really necessary, it was a good way to see off the Ending.  (Even if it was the Opening this week) I still dont know where the money for the Traps is coming from, but whatever.

**Ep 63**: This time we have a more serious episode, which is mainly there to give Zenzou more character. The advice Gin gave to Okuni is nothing new and was used in many other stories with characters that can see the future, but it is still a nice advice no less. Comedy in this episode is like in the last episode, good at times, but not on the level of others. (The Episode doesnt want to be like this, so that is alright)

**Ep 64**: What is there to say about this episode? Kazura is Kazura and more Kazura is never a bad thing.  One of the better episodes this week.

**Ep 65 & 66**: Two episodes that I would consider as below average in quality to other episodes of Gintama. Even though they have their small moments, they are overall not on par with the rest of Gintama.

**Ep 67**: The first split episode since 48 and the best episode of the week. (Not the greatest achievement in this weak week) Great Comedy, especially in the second half with Sacchan and Zenzou.

The worst week of Gintama, for the rest of the anime. From now on it will only become better and better.  Next week we have a short arc of three episodes that will introduce one of my favorite characters of the series. Im really looking forward to the next three weeks, because they will be great weeks of Gintama.  

>> ARTICLE
What a great batch of episodes! I laughed a least once in every episode.  
I think that from this point in the series you can hear that the producers nail the mood with the magnificent OST Gintama has.

I apologize in advance for what youre about to read.

*****

**Ep. 207**  The drawer wasnt working out for you, Sacchan? Master of the guilt trip. Oh hey, its engagement screw guy. Dont think shes talking about putting the glasses on her face, Gin. Geeze, she straight up ragdolled after the car hit her. Nice callback to 67.5 for the job acceptance scene. Not the proper behavior when in the presence of a lady. Assassin assassins are coming to assassinate poor conflicted Sacchan!

> Would you let me put on my glasses?

Okay, Ill allow you one. Cant have everyone giving us cheese. Kaguras pet names are the best. 

> There wont be any cracks in your vision

Gin pls. Give me time to recover before giving me another serving. Assassin assassin Odd Jobs are coming to assassinate the assassin assassins! Sadaharu: cargo edition. Could have gone without Sadaharus shit with the camera pointed at his anus. Who gave Sadaharu a radio? TL Notes, where are you? I had to go look up the [Don Quijote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quijote_(store\)) joke. Ninja v Ninja hype!

*****

**Ep. 208**  Dont neglect your hemorrhoids for Sacchans sake, Zenzou! Odd Jobs is in full-on goof-off mode.

*Punisher No. 1* - What Looney Tunes shit is he dealing in? [TL Notes, where did you go?](http://www.secom.co.jp/english/)

*Punisher No. 2* - So what does he do if his target is a female? Death by fashion.

*Chuubert Chu Brothers* - Sacchan larvae :3. So they left? What about the assassination part? Expect butt play when Zenzou is involved. Gin melting down after setting off an inexplicable explosion. Assassin assassin clearly upset Sacchan with his weakness talk. Was about to call dream sequence until I remembered Gengai had his hand in repairing the glasses. Back to her old hyper destructive self.

*****

**Ep. 209**  Gin seems upset about having to do recap.

I welcome your cheap tricks, show. Congrats on the success of Benizakura-hen! Shh, I like random babbling, Shinpachi. Lol they made a full song for Hasegawas singer/songwriter persona.

Birth of the White Yaksha. Dont you tease me, show. You even threw in DONTEN!. [I thought Sakamotos voice sounded familiar](http://myanimelist.net/character/53641/). I take back everything Ive said about him. Gintama = (0.25)(One Piece). Kondo youve barely shown up this season and youre *already* subjecting me to your nudity. Sacchan not even attempting to mask her intent for showing up. Shh, I like the Gintama Circus, Shinpachi. Supervisor is sassy today. DONDAKE!

Ginpachi-sensei! Romantic metaphor. [Ladies, there was an AskReddit thread is youre curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/150a04/can_males_of_reddit_try_and_describe_the_pain_of/).

I swear today is a full-fledged variety show. *Heartless and Hardcore*. Nothing can stop Takasugis popularity. Looks like Shinpachi stole the Sharingan.

Boring recap special. Straight-up mafia wars incoming.

*****

**Ep. 210**  [Durarara!! Ep 15](/s "Anyone asking for the strongest in the city is looking for a fight.") Thanks for detailing the playing field, random bartender. Thats one way to introduce yourself. Shh, Gin. Become Darth Vader. For me. [The hell is this cutesy-ass face](https://ginnodangan.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/gintama210-11.jpg)? Decorating. Kagura fits right into the gangster persona. [Gura x Gin x Sugar in action](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/fc/cf/4c/fccf4ce571a8c7702f9eee03758ef55c.jpg). Wow, theyre shaking down the Yazuka shakedown. Birabirabirabirabirako man switched to War Mode. Sup, 7:3? Running wild. So it was an actual farm *des-ooo*? Gin has absolutely no luck when in the company of Pirako. Saigos gonna do some neutering.

*****

**Ep. 211**  Already laying down the foreboding backstory to Jirocho over a sick refrain. Pirako obviously got her looks elsewhere. 7:3 no!!! Gin yet again diving to his certain death from an eerily familiar looking pier. Damn Pirako that is some seriously manipulative bullshittery to justify aggression. Oh my god he chopped her front-tail off! Oh boy, you can see the concern in Gins run.

> They just happen to be my family

Lovely line and shot. I know hes making a bid for the city but the swiftness of offing Otose still surprised me. White Yaksha activation. Yeah, hes a bit pissed off. You can feel the rage on both sides. *Theres* the injury Gin has to sustain for a serious arc. Impressively tied back to their first encounter at the husbands grave.

*****

**Ep. 212**  Not sure why Pirako is gluing her front-tail back on when she has enough bang left to make another one. Interesting touch showing signs of lost sleep over Otoses condition. Catherine pls youre even uglier when angry and crying. Anyone else get some excitement out of seeing the word spread? I know it was a sad moment but Sadaharus howl cracked me up. Something something childhood friend always loses. I feel like Otose becomes more notable as time goes on. Given Pirakos spot-on evaluation of Gin and Jirochos quality of duty and background dotted with similar events, youd think she would realize shes treading a purposefully dangerous path in trying to bring him back. Im not used to Tama as a contributor to serious moments. I was taken aback there for a second.

> Its your turn to trust us

Theres something I appreciate about things getting talked over openly at such an important point in the story. Why would anyone want to fight with a stomach full of milk? 

*****

**Ep. 213**

> Its cleaning time

Look at Tama with the one-liners! Even *I* would think twice about Pirakos marriage proposal. I know theres a meaning and purpose for their return, but I can only think about the fandom geeking out at the sight of a long-forgotten or underappreciated character. Sorry Durinthal, no Kirara. Kabuki is not a place I want to live in if Otae rules it. Look at her ghoul eyes! If theres one thing I love about you, show, it would be how anyone entangled in violence is capable of defending himself/herself. Saigos flopping! Seems the fight in front of Otoses Snack House has devolved a bit.

> A male escort is only allowed to penetrate women

Kyoshiro pls. Giving context to the wording Pirako has been using when referring to her father. Kada confirmed space pirate peacock princess. Gin and Jirocho gained a strangely playful rapport in the midst of things. Was that R-18 line about ratings? TL Notes, halp! The White Yakshas gonna clean house.

*****

**Ep. 214**  The mother returns! Sup, 7:3? I might shut the door on Kabuki Cats too. Saigo pls I didnt need to see that bulge. Rated R-18 indeed. Shit is getting heated with Jirocho and Gin. Just look at their heavily detailed expressions. Base monkeys > space pirate peacock princess. So both of them made a one-sided promise to the same man and their differing approaches to fulfill it led them to an unavoidable confrontation. Building tension in the last swing with Pirako & Company barreling down the hallway. Finally clearing the air with Otose. Look at all of these eavesdroppers. 

> You can have your way with me

Pirako pls. Hasegawa didnt even do anything! Dont give him any credit. The more I see Tatsumi and Tetsuko the more I believe they belong in gawdy 80s music video. What a sweet reintroduction and fantastic arc.

*****

Since I got a nonzero response to it last week, lets do another round of:

###Crack Ship Corner

Exterior shot of the Central Terminal sweeping downward. The main entrance is roped off. Inside, the familiar faces of the Shinsengumi mill about as if in search of something. Kondo is in the middle of a line of questions, inserting at least two Baka slip-ups. *yahoo-hoo*! Hata explains that the new pet he was attempting to smuggle into Edo managed to get free while amongst the other baggage. He is now likely hiding out of sight and prone to attack if approached rather than lured out. After an obnoxious speech about indoctrinating the pet on the subject of Love & Peace, Hata ensures them a display of affection will attract the dangerous animal. Kondo proceeds to pour his heart out to an absent Otae for the umpteenth time to no avail. Okita and Hijikata share a look of exhaustion that Okita breaks, acknowledging how someone should get it over with already. Tsun-jikata reacts with a flustered look as Okita turns to him, walks past him, up to Prince Hata, digs his hands into Hatas hair, and leans in

[Okita x Hata](http://i.imgur.com/KlTn7YM.jpg)

The camera cuts to Gin opening the front door of the Odd Jobs office right before lip meets lip. Gin looks down with a groaning mumble as though he is suffering from a nasty hangover. Cut to black after a shortened pan downward. We hear a slicing sound as though from a set of sharpened claws. End on the wails of Gin and the Shinsengumi.

I must admit, so was I. Seeing Tama actually kicking ass was a bit of a surprise for me but that's the reason she's No.2 best girl for me.
>> ARTICLE
Katsuo's first appearance in Episode 55 had a long-winded speech about 7:3 as the Golden Ratio through which the universe is based on. In this arc it was referenced as retribution - give them back 7 for every 3 they take.
>> ARTICLE
Ohhhhhhhh. That's quite a subtle reference. At least now I get why they kept mentioning the 7:3 ratio now.
>> ARTICLE
It's more specifically referencing his hair. It's parted at a 7:3 split which is/was generally used for Japanese salary-men a few decades ago.
>> ARTICLE
Well that just shows how ignorant I am. Interesting to know if not a bit odd that all salary-men had the same hairstyle.

It's just a "look" that's played up for laughs. Like the "chomage" hairstyle you see in Gintama.

That trailer part of episode 209 is actually a shot-for-shot copy of [Gintama's Jump Anime Tour 2008](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6945/Gintama:_Jump_Anime_Tour_2008_Special) video, also known as the Shiroyasha Koutan OVA. It's almost the same video material but with different voice-over. It's hilarious, and it even used some of the [original first One Piece OP](http://i.imgur.com/6Hht0mr.jpg). Unfortunately I can't seem to find a streaming version of that video, either legal or illegal, so it seems like the only way to get it is via download.

Oh man, that makes the (0.25)(One Piece) jabs even better. Also I suppose that does make it more of a recap special after all.

Thanks for the heads-up on the specials. I planned on scouring for them if we don't cover them here in preparation for the new season in April. Figured they'd be a bit obscured.

The first fight with Jirocho....that was painful. Gin normally trash talks his opponents or at the very least tells them he'll fuck them up, but he didn't say anything. Nothing but silence. The scenes where he was running towards the graveyard and then crawling to her body....Why are there crumpled tissues next to me? I didn't come here for the feels.

I mean I knew she was gonna survive and what not but still that was the second "oh shit" moment for me in Gintama and the next episode where they show Catherine outside her room. The first was Kagura snapping.

**Ep. 207** - Turn on the TV, every channel is Sacchannel. ^(Doesn't work if you say it out loud though.) Sadaharu actually listens to Gintoki, when did that start happening? Oops, broke her glasses. Her *grandmother's* glasses. [Even Sadaharu gives Gin that look](http://i.imgur.com/KRRDbLB.png) and it's silly on the dog.

So time to get a new pair? Sacchan must be ecstatic. Engagement glasses? That's a new one. And we see that weird guy seen in several OPs but never with a major role (or even named yet, I think) apparently runs a glasses store. Nice attempt to upsell there, but even I could make up better fake/ridiculous stories than that. Good to see that Gin's apparently going to get the original pair repaired too.

Then Sacchan goes crazy and starts dating the old man's glasses that Gin thrust upon her. I'm not opposed if it means we get [more](http://i.imgur.com/Jc1JmXF.png) [cute](http://i.imgur.com/i16dhfi.png) [Sacchan](http://i.imgur.com/bMamo6K.png) like this. I also never knew that you could turn putting glasses on into an erotic act, but Sacchan keeps surprising me (and making me feel confused about the glasses I'm currently wearing). She even dumps Gin for Glassin-san! Poor Gin doesn't even realize it though.

Unfortunately those old man glasses don't actually help her see (and she looks better with her other pair anyway), so of course here comes trouble. Aww, she values them as the first present Gin gave her. Too bad that's going to get her ~~killed~~ nearly killed. Team Lethal Odd Jobs to save the day!

By which I mean they take her over to Zenzo's house and make themselves at home. Probably not a bad place to make a stand against the Assassins of Assassins Assassination Squad or whatever their name is. I love that they're playing the BGM on a stereo and he makes them stop it.

---
**Ep. 208** - So there are several assassins sneaking into the house and Kagura decides to take a nap next to Sacchan. I'm not surprised by that. A pillow *bomb* assassin? I was expecting a guy that would just smother you in your sleep. Kagura is hilarious when sleeping and takes a guy out without much effort (or apparently even waking up) on her part.

...really, the second guy is a T-shirt assassin? I've lost all faith in whoever sent these goons to take out Sacchan. [No kidding, show.](http://i.imgur.com/w9huUNG.png) [Seriously, what the hell.](http://i.imgur.com/5Xr0NOc.png) Chuuberts! Reminds me of the episode with Sougo and Hijikata locked up together. Definitely a cultural thing but it's still funny.

Finally the leader calls in a bunch of somewhat competent assassins and just when everything seems grim, Sacchan's there with her repaired glasses. And since they were fixed by Gengai, she now has [MOTHERFUCKIN' LASER VISION!](http://i.imgur.com/qneR2Zl.png) [That's some sweet armo--](http://i.imgur.com/5UdpusW.png) wait, [those feathers have balls.](http://i.imgur.com/bCjISNt.png) Never change, Sacchan.

---
**Ep. 209** - Yes, old jokes in widescreen! [Nice jab at Haruhi there](http://i.imgur.com/iPn89sn.png) though I haven't seen that series yet. So to stall for time, we get wart-Hasegawa's song in full. Even though I watched the rest of Evangelion this week I still haven't made the connection between the voices for Hasegawa and Gendo Ikari when listening to them. I'm kinda glad for that.

Then we get a trailer for a movie I *know* doesn't exist, but they still got me anyway. I know they'll probably never do a movie about the war, but that looks amazing.

And after that everyone wants their own movie. All fun but not a lot to talk about. [I honestly don't remember what this is about](http://i.imgur.com/RtNVkYV.png) [but I like the art](http://i.imgur.com/O2VGiDX.png). Also time for Takasugi to be the bad boy in school! Um... Shinpachi, you've [got something in your eye.](http://i.imgur.com/CTEt5yE.png) Code Geass or something else I'm missing?

---
**Ep. 210** - Four Devas arc! I've heard good things about this one too and Otose is my favorite underrated character, so I'm stoked.

Mysterious figure wants to find the strongest person in the Kabuki District? Can't be good for Gin, and despite his low key demeanor he has that kind of reputation. Gin blocks their attack and... it's a young girl? This can't be good.

Love a sleepy Kagura just knocking the door onto both of them. I wonder how frequently they have to replace that thing. Pirako's charging in and wants to take over the town with Gin? Yeah, she's up to no good, just a matter of finding out her motivation. Worse, she's crazy and [likes to turn people into flowers of blood.](http://i.imgur.com/i0zc3II.png) Not sure if she's yandere or just a psycopathic serial killer.

On the other hand, [Kagura definitely chose the thug life.](http://i.imgur.com/RGZpTah.png) Fun to see her take to the role so readily but I hope it doesn't get to her head. Some of Jirocho's group pick a fight with them, that's not going to end well for those guys. [Are you scared? I'm scared.](http://i.imgur.com/5KOgEJJ.png)

I mentioned it when she first made an appearance but I'm still convinced [Kada](http://i.imgur.com/FbwBQdN.png) is an [Abriel](http://myanimelist.net/anime/290/Seikai_no_Monshou) in all but name. [For comparison.](http://i.imgur.com/MZsuxEK.png) It also turns out the exact same studio worked on Crest of the Stars about a decade earlier, I wonder if any people drew both of them.

---
**Ep. 211** - Gin and Pirako are in a rough spot there with the cement. Oh hey, it's seven for three guy! We finally find out more of Pirako's background, she's Jirocho's daughter! And trying to get him in fighting form again. Not 7:3 guy! Come on, Gin, that's a good way to get yourself drowned.

Additionally, we get Otose's background and relationship with Jirocho, who was a childhood friend. Otose ended up marrying Tatsugoro though, and overall the three of them had a pretty complicated deal.

Otose receives a call from "Gintoki" though we never hear his voice, and then sends everyone away. That can't be a good sign. Visiting her husband's grave and... yep, Jirocho shows up. That's right, [she only has a family.](http://i.imgur.com/alNHiAH.png) 

Shit, Gin's too late. And we see the debt he owes Otose, which I think we've seen before? At least part of it since it's when they first met and I remember something like this coming up in one of Otose's early episodes. [Love the contrast](http://i.imgur.com/9BcYU8L.png) [between these two shots.](http://i.imgur.com/tz2LFCv.png)

Gintoki failed to protect her this time, though.

---
**Ep. 212** - Good, Otose's still alive. Poor Catherine, Otose's like a mother to her, particularly after her episode last week.

Nope, can't destroy the snack house. Just can't do it. Gin's still kicking too, but he's down since Jirocho bested him once. Jumping around to a lot of the characters that Odd Jobs have helped in the past, seeing word of the war and Otose's fall spread... [here comes Otose's faction.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GondorCallsForAid)

Shinpachi, Kagura, Catherine, and Tama share a moment after packing up. Aww, even Sadaharu's sad about leaving.

Gin talks to 7:3 guy (I forget his actual name) and we learn a bit more about Jirocho. Turns out Tatsugoro took a bullet for him, so now Jirocho's in town to look after Otose? Kinda like Gin that way.

Gin's going to protect Otose to the end, but Shinpachi and Kagura aren't going to let him do that alone. Catherine and Tama too!

Go away guys, bar's closed and [Gin wants to drink his strawberry milk alone.](http://i.imgur.com/79v5Zdn.png)

---
**Ep. 213** - Team Odd Jobs is here to defend their turf, and they aren't alone. Time for everyone in the district they've helped in the past to come to their aid, including the hard-boiled detective. I love these kinds of scenes when old allies turn up again in a desperate time of need. Poor Hasegawa, cardboard robot. I like Otae's group of cabaret girls and now she's claiming to be the queen, eh?

Ooh, Gin is leaving Pirako and Saigo to Shinpachi and Kagura. I like this. They often hold their own in big arcs like this but now they're really stepping up in a big way. Saigo's only there because Kada has leverage on him, so he's thankful they're aiming to save his kid too.

We interrupt this dramatic moment to bring you men in dresses literally lining up to be stabbed by a male escort. Lots of innuendo here. They seem to be okay with it, so I'm guessing there's something up. Yep, it's a prop sword.

Pirako goes off to join her father but... Kada's set all of this up so she could waltz in and take over. The latter's about to eliminate Jirocho, but now's the perfect time for Gin to step in.

---
**Ep. 214** - Time for the final showdown! Otose needs to rally the troops first though, and you know she's good for that.

Heh, Shinpachi and Kagura in catsuits, complete with ears. I love the western music running throughout the arc. Saigo's kid is safe, so time for his faction to tear into Kada's group too.

I don't know if something's changed about the show or me, but I'm loving these fights now. First Gin vs. Jirocho, Kagura and Shinpachi against Pirako and Saigo, now Gin and Jirocho against Kada. Also some fantastic music in this scene. Man, this is ridiculously bloody too.

Sorry Kada, you aren't gonna win this one. Time for her to escape and tell the Harusame. Jirocho and Gin get a moment to contemplate Tatsugoro before getting their final battle against each other. Gin triumphs, but as usual he takes a different route and Jirocho survives for another day.

Looks like Kada doesn't get away after all! Pirako's an interesting problem for Gin, wonder what's going to happen with her. Aww, it's a reunion with her father, who finally returns home.

---
It's hard to pin down one reason why, but this is now my favorite arc. Pirako, the shifting alliances, Otose and her past, Shinpachi and Kagura holding their own, Gin's parallels with Jirocho, it all adds up.

EDIT: Added in an additional response.

You're putting me to shame with all these screenshots, but I like them none the less. Helps me see things that I didn't notice beforehand or to remember certain points.

> Even Sadaharu gives Gin that look.

Just shows how integrated Sadaharu is with the Yorozuya's way of doing things.

> (and making me feel confused about the glasses I'm currently wearing)

As a fellow glasses wearer that made me feel a bit awkward in a good , funny way.

>No kidding, show.

Zenzou makes a great straight guy.


> Nice jab at Haruhi there though I haven't seen that series yet.

[MFW I read this.](http://i.imgur.com/LwvFrxE.jpg) We gotta fix that. You're missing out on best girl [Nagato!](http://i.imgur.com/glsnFOj.jpg)

> Kagura definitely chose the thug life.

YEAHHHHHHHH! Thug Kagura is no doubt the best Kagura.

> Gin wants to drink his strawberry milk alone.

I feel like its been a while since we've seen Gin with strawberry milk.

> We interrupt this dramatic moment to bring you men in dresses literally lining up to be stabbed by a male escort. 

That entire scene had me laughing in amazement. I'm fairly sure if any other show did that I would've been annoyed but with Gintama stuff like that is the norm.

> It's hard to pin down one reason why, but this is now my favorite arc.

I admit, as I read your write-up I was thinking whether I actually prefer this arc over the Red Spider arc (Which is my 2nd favourite arc after Yoshiwara in Flames). It was really well done, both in visuals and in the actual story.
>> ARTICLE
You got all fancy and added screenshots! Very nice. Liked seeing some of the shot comparisons that I didn't necessarily pick up on in my watch.

> wait, those feathers have balls.

Didn't even notice that. I know nothing about feathers so I'll go ahead and accept it as Sacchan being Sacchan.

> Fun to see her take to the role so readily but I hope it doesn't get to her head

I think it's a bit too late for Kagura on that front. Granted, that's a trait that I really like in her.

> Gin talks to 7:3 guy (I forget his actual name)

[Katsuo's](http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Kurogoma_Katsuo) the name but honestly it's funner to refer to him as 7:3.

> Pirako's an interesting problem for Gin, wonder what's going to happen with her.

I fail to see the problem. It's really only a concern for Best Girl and Sacchan, the latter of which got some recent screentime with Gin so she's probably content for the time being.

I was watching on my phone and taking frequent screenshots just to make it easier to write up later, so throwing in a few was pretty easy.

> I fail to see the problem. It's really only a concern for Best Girl and Sacchan, the latter of which got some recent screentime with Gin so she's probably content for the time being.

I was thinking of her as still a sort of adversary for Gin, but that's not really the case.

Poor Jirocho, looking even more like a dark-skinned Gin in that art. Even with that I still really love the fanart that Gintama has spawned. Also those OP's and ED's are all over the place. I'm still sour about how we'll never get that 4th ED, I just love it visually.

Anyway, onto my spiel of nonsense.

**Episode 207 ** Again with the digital transition. I really dont get the whole 3D TV thing. All it does is give me headaches as Gin is demonstrating. Sacchan is really good at making people feel guilty. Even Sadaharu [isnt having any of it.](http://i.imgur.com/yJtbFpo.png) Oh hey its Mushashi! Sa-chan looking a lot of Otsuu in that glasses montage, I never realised that having a new pair of glasses would be so intense. A love between a pair of glasses and their wearer is quite a serious thing Gin! Nice to see this [gag returning.](http://i.imgur.com/deA39ak.png) Sa-chan letting her personal feelings for Gin get in the way of her work. Wait, this is a serious story? 

I liked the Wild Western sounding music for the Odd Jobs intense food making in Zenzous house. Zenzous situation is perfect for killing some assassins. Kaguras ponytail looks cute Sleeping? It sounded more like they were imitating interference to me. Of course the Odd Jobs trio ran away to a store. Next episode is set to be intense.
*****
**Episode 208 ** That jingle is too cheerful given the situation. This is the worst time to be shopping I think. Kagura having quite the intense dream. Daww she drew fake eyes on her eyelids. Swapping pillows doesnt really work against Kagura. These assassins are great. Zenzou makes a great straight man.[Thats some really acute hearing youre got there Gin.](http://i.imgur.com/qZBHApl.png). They stole the knobs! Dont stand between a man and the longer part of a Chuubert. Random Chuubert induced explosion. At least the leader seems like a proper assassin.

Sa-chan to the rescue. Zenzou, you might want to get that checked if its getting worse. WHY CANT MY GLASSES DO THAT! I WANT TALKJNG GLASSES THAT CAN SHOOT LASER BEAMS! Clearly Ive been getting my glasses from the wrong place. [This](http://i.imgur.com/g0gwHp3.png) reference is whoosing past my head. On second thought those glasses are quite dangerous. Being Zenzou is suffering apparently. Incase I didnt say it last week Ill say it again. Im really starting to dig the ED song.

*****

**Episode 209 ** I want to know what Gin was saying damn it. [SHOTS FIRED!](http://i.imgur.com/CQdZiZA.png) Oh hey, its Hasegawas song from episode 203 along with a montage of all the moments he showed up. Is this what the entire episode is going to consist of? I wont complain if thats the case since I enjoy hearing about the complaints the cast have. A movie trailer for the Amanto war? I want this!

Birth of the White Yaksha Preview with my favourite OP song. Shame this movie wasnt real, or is it the movie that people say it meant to be watched after the series finale? If not then I hope in the future it will because Ive always been interested in the Amanto War. [Dont lie to me!](http://i.imgur.com/MkAE6I1.png) Now everyone wants their own movie. I love how random this episode is. DONDAKE! 

Ginpachi-sensei!  You dont want to know how much getting hit there hurts, trust me. Of course Prince-Baka is the prince on the horse. Nice metaphor Ginpachi-sensei if not a bit long winded. Takasugi-kun? What was with [Shinpachis eye](http://i.imgur.com/yZ5WY4n.png) here? Four Devas hype! This is gonna be good! At least now I know where one of the first GIFS I saw for Gintama came from.
*****
**Episode 210 ** Starting off with the new girl who weve seen in the OP before with her red hair standing in a field of flowers. This feels like Im watching a wild west film or something with this plot. Stranger enters a town and asks who the strongest people in the town are to take them down. She sure gave up quickly. Pirakos voice is too cutesy for a killer. Again with the flower analogy, she seems to look at killing as an artform. Kagura and Pirako are really getting into the gangster spirit with the shades and everything.

[Kagura x Food OTP!](http://i.imgur.com/o1XAEAk.png). Shinpachi getting demoted to a cockroach like Hasegawa back in episode 201. Everyone hates you Shinpachi, just admit it. Everyone breaking their bones and magically recovering a second later. #JustAnimeThings. Hey its Katsuo! Havent seen him for a while. Tensions are mounting for the Four Devas. And theres our missing Deva who is the main antagonist of this arc. Ok this guy is good with a katana. Im looking forward to seeing the inevitable fight between him and Gin.
*****
**Episode 211 ** So we now have a pact among the Four Devas whereby whoever picks a fight with any other faction the other 3 factions will team up and kill them. But really they just want Jirouchou out of the picture. Otose is quite suspicious about Pirakos timing. So Pirako is actually working with Jirocho and just so happens to be his daughter and Gin is getting setup to make it look like he attacked Jiro's gang, even going as far to stab Katsuo to make the framing all the more effective. Now the seeds of doubt are being sown. So both Otose and her husband knew Jirochou since childhood. Going by Jiros response to this backstory however he isnt too fond of reminiscing and then goes off to presumably settle things once and for all with Otose. Yep, this pretty most confirms it. Getting rid of everyone else like that. This is getting serious. Gin knows whats coming. 

I really like the track used in the conversation between Otose and Jirochou. It really sets the tone nicely. OTOSE NO! YOU CANT BE! DONT TELL ME SHES DEAD! GOD DAMN IT! Heres the inevitable meeting between Gin and Jirochou which started off with a serious bang! I love that black and white cut of Gin when he was leaping to attack, blinded by rage. THIS IS INTENSE! GIN NO! Everything about this arc is great so far, especially in the visual department. Is it as good as Yoshiwara in Flames? Well have to wait and see. Now that we have some backstory the ED makes a lot more sense.
*****
**Episode 212 ** Is Pirako gluing her cowlick back onto her hair? Otose isnt dead but that just leaves me asking why Jiro didnt finish her off. Only two days until what is essentially their home is burnt down. Better work fast then! It isnt like Gin to give up so easily. I like how all the side characters like Hasegawa and even the more obscure ones like the Hard-boiled detective or Tatsumi the firefighter are being alerted of the situation. Settle down everyone, its time for more backstory.

The younger version of Jirochou looks like a darker skinned Gin and Otoses husband, Tatsugorou looks like Hijikata. Younger Otose looks a bit like Otae. So Tatsugorou took a bullet for Jirochou and then Jiro no doubt has survivors guilt. And so that leads to him neglecting his daughter which is how we get to where we are now. So both Gin and Jiro are both tied down by a promise but they both have conflicting methods with which to reach the goal. As someone said back during the Yoshiwara in Flames discussion you know that shits getting real when you see Gin with an actual sword. Shinpachi delivering quite the encouraging speech. Tama and Catherine also showing up to help.

> Whats with that group of men or women or both or neither? 

This line got a chuckle out of me.

Dont stand between Gin and his strawberry milk. Everyone setting up for what looks to be quite a large fight again accompanied by this awesome wild western sounding music.
*****
**Episode 213 ** Starting straight off with Gin literally sweeping away everyone like a whirlwind. Go Tama! Even Shinpachi gets his moment of badassness. Outnumbered and now up against the clock. Things arent looking good for Gin and co HA! I love all these side characters like Tetsuko, Tatsumi and the hard boiled detective guy showing up to assist. Everyones reunited to help protect the Yorozuya in their time of need. Poor Hasegawa, getting beat up while everyone else is kicking ass. OHHHH YES! Kagura and Shinpachi now getting their moment of glory. Shinpachi! Since when were you so badass! 
Ok now this is getting weird with Kyoshiro and the line of transvestites lining up to get stabbed by him. Special technique to kill a tranny? Battle of Bootyloo? This is getting more absurd by the minute. More backstory for Pirako this time showing that shes fighting for a different promise. Ah, so the real mastermind was Princess Kada and she has some elite soldiers in reserve. Gin and Jiro making light of their situation by laughing hysterically as you do before kicking ass. Im looking forward to seeing the conclusion to this arc.
(continued below)
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 214 ** Otose casually telling everyone to stop bickering as she says, once again showing how great how character is in these serious moments. Saigous son is not impressed with The Kabuki Cats. Now back to the really bloody mess that Gin and Jiro find themselves in, I never realised until now how bloody the fights really are in Gintama until now. The power of promises beats everything! So both Gin and Jiro have an item from Tatsugorou and both made one-sided promises. If theres one thing that Gintama does well in these arcs its really making you understand if not sympathise with the antagonists, this one being no exception. This final standoff is just awesome to watch. 

Jiro finally realising that Kabuki is strong enough to protect itself and that Gin is fiercely loyal to his promise. You all interrupted the good part with those videos cameras! Damn, Im letting this get to me. Princess Kada is back for some revenge, just to get it cut short by Gin. Of course their not gonna leave any loose ends with Pirakos relationship to her father. I liked how Hasegawa was being turned into a full Gundam/mech thingy. Ending the arc in that same field of flowers that were shown at the start

> Im home.

Great way to end the arc. Id say this arc was pretty good, not as good as Yoshiwara in Flames or the Red Spider arc but it would probably be my third favourite. My original third favourite was the Shinsengumi Crisis arc.

> Im really starting to dig the ED song

I can see why the sub endorses [Spyair](https://www.youtube.com/user/spyairSMEJ/videos) whenever they come up.

Shinpachi called it a circus and he wasn't lying. Gotta love it when the show gets a bit untethered.

> Everyone hates you Shinpachi, just admit it.

Blasphemy! Shinpachi best *tsukkomi*!

> Is Pirako gluing her cowlick back onto her hair?

What is she without her front-trail ^^or ^^father ^^figure ?

> If theres one thing that Gintama does well in these arcs its really making you understand if not sympathise with the antagonists

Gintama really has mastered the "hero of his own story" antagonist. I wouldn't even call it formulaic since the composition of each arc has at least a few other threads that tie together nicely through a single motif.

() I saw what you did there.

I don't comment very often but this week I have to. The Four Devas arc hit all the right notes for me. I've always liked Otose so I was interested from the start in getting more characterization from her. She's always been low key important but now we get to see how much of a pillar she is to the Kabuki District and to Gintoki.

The cinematography was over the top. It really was excessive, but it somehow still felt right. I tried not to pause to take screenshots too often so as not to ruin the mood or flow, so I missed a lot of good shots.

The framing was varied and felt significant most of the time. Here some foreboding imagery of Otose surrounded by gravestones and speaking with the villain [1](http://i.imgur.com/pNbsWAX.png). Gintoki's walk of shame after failing [2](http://i.imgur.com/3tAp39c.png). Imagery suggesting Pirako is the real villain or is at least still at odds with Jirocho [3](http://i.imgur.com/GcBqEsF.png). This one simply looked good, to see Gintoki and Jirocho as comrades through the debris, the battle won [4](http://i.imgur.com/IZE7YMo.png). One final score to settle, silhouettes the dead and of swords appearing as crosses [5](http://i.imgur.com/dsWehsg.png).

Normally I can't stand abuse of dutch angle shots but I was pretty shocked when Otose was cut down so early and so severely that those shots felt right most of the time. They start when Gintoki is returning to the bar from Pirako's betrayal, and continue throughout the arc. The first fight starts [1](http://i.imgur.com/mbGzBvM.png). Catherine has now lost it and I really felt for her [2](http://i.imgur.com/G2CmnnM.png). You are already dead [3](http://i.imgur.com/ZH4f1mr.png). Dutch angles to the end even when they don't make sense anymore [4](http://i.imgur.com/nlqBhRM.png).

Some colour play stood out as well. When Gintoki snaps [1](http://i.imgur.com/YEWm3kU.png), but he is the only one that lost colour. Here he is wanting to do things alone again [2](http://i.imgur.com/yYzRoKs.png) but Kagura stops him. I don't think that entryway has ever been unlit by itself. This gave me some [Dante](http://i.imgur.com/Em2hhIu.png)/[Vergil](http://i.imgur.com/0DLyzSQ.png) vibes with the colours and motivations given and I've heard that red is a stereotypical "heroic" colour in Japan, though I'm not sure if blue is significant like that.

I also loved the way they used sound to great effect. Particularly after Gintoki was beaten by Jirocho in the graveyard and is remembering his first encounter with Otose [1](http://i.imgur.com/FtsrEJ7.png), the palette is a soft blue and there is no music or sound, only the conversation. Then the scene cuts to now with pounding rain and no talking, and an incredibly dark blue palette [2](http://i.imgur.com/JjiXg1L.png). I found the sound design at that part to be brilliant. The spaghetti western style music was fun and really worked at the end when the final showdown was at [sunset](http://i.imgur.com/TR7qTWm.png).

I also want to point out the incredible quality of the closeups at the [end](http://i.imgur.com/uSsDW4e.png). That looks OVA quality with all the shading tones. Jirocho has 4 shades on his nose plus hatching (it didn't move but it was still pleasing). The fight choreography also looked great, better than it's been yet. I will take a full recap episode before the next arc if the quality is boosted that much.

As for the way the arc played out, it turned into a power of friendship themed story in the middle which I normally despise, but everyone already had the power to win. It was great that the residents of the Kabuki District who were introduced early on came together to help Otose and friends, using their strengths to win. Incredibly heart-warming and believable. Jirocho also turns out to be an anti-villain turned anti-hero which I'm a complete sucker for. And we finally get a real villain who is completely unsympathetic. Not to diss the other arcs but their villains started to become ineffective to me when every one is given a sympathetic backstory. Then the story returns to Gintoki and Jirocho to fulfill their oaths and protect their town. This is the right way to write a power of friendship victory.
>> ARTICLE
I remember reading an interview with the director saying that they concentrated some of the Gintama budget on this fight scene (or maybe the whole arc) as opposed to some other episodes. After all, animation doesn't have to be outstanding for comedy, but for fights like Jirocho vs Gintoki, they went all-out and were going for movie-quality (but of course their budget might have fallen short of that).

This is becoming one of my favorite arcs in Gintama. Seeing Gintoki snap like this is rare and the last episode was fantastic. And the fanart this week is also really good.

In the flashback with Pirako and her mother after Jirocho leaves them, the mom talks about how Jirocho promised to come back to them after the war, however, the mom says he's still out fighting the war and hasn't come back yet. 

At the end of the arc, when Jirocho has fulfilled his promise to protect the town and passed it to the new generation, he returns to his daughter in the field of flowers. The last words of the episode were him saying "I'm back". 

aaaand commence waterworks....

**Ep. 139**

> There is no night that does not end

The groundwork laid in this opening. Its already very promising. Mutual pickpocketing. Gin literally shaking off women. We found Shinpachis weak point. Im already invested in this kids objectives and the mystery of the city and this woman; normally Im playfully flippant in that regard. Scrubbed down by Tama^(jealous). She found *his* weak point. Oh hey, is this that best girl that everyone was giddy over last week? No time being wasted with the limb severing this arc. Poor Seita, getting gipped. Gin isnt screwing around either.

> Above or below, I live by my own rules

Someone really should have started a counter for these lines. Liking the imagery in the description of this courtesan. You know shit is about to go down when the show breaks out the inserts with pummeling guitar.

**Ep. 140**  Leave it to Gin to show up in true heroic fashion and make all the badass moves. Well, almost. Poor Gin, I didnt expect him to be so self-conscious over botching a save, but man is it amusing.

> Your kindness is going to make me cry

He seems to have a good impression of this best girl. OTP pending confirmation. [Error processing confirmation]( http://i.imgur.com/vXihy.jpg ). Again, the backstory so much more compelling than normal. Tsukuyos prideful self resenting the thought of becoming merchandise above all else. Hinowa using the concept of a cages size determined by the mindset of the caged. Good stuff. God damn Hosen is harsh. Kagura suddenly got serious. That does not bode well. Yato are fucking scary. Just look at that environmental destruction. AND weve got a brooding big brother on our hands.

**Ep. 141**  Kamui doesnt care much about appearances, eh? That smack came without any warning. The brutality is real this week. Im more surprised that they went three days without any interruption. Lecture counter increment. Heh, its as if Tsukuyo is besting Gin at his own game. He isnt amused. Kamuis accusations of Hosen hit the mark. Licking blood *sigh*. I get it, show. His lust for violence clouds his sense of reason. Pako makes her triumphant, busty return. Could have done without the comments on Hosens junk. Lesson learned: dont actively dodge kunai. Stick to the wall like Shinpachi. Yeah, this woman was pretty much written as Gins eventual counterpart.

> Im 100% pure city girl

Yes. Yes you are, Kagura.

**Ep. 142**  Shinpachi & Kagura have become full-fledged siblings. Tsukuyo getting absolutely skewered. The use of the sun as a motif works nicely, but I cant help but expect an out-of-place recurring character to barge in and make some comment to the effect of why did everyone start talking about the sun and sky? Warming up to this supposed best girl. Alright. Guys. Lets just geek out over this fight because we all know it was awesome:

* [Bit Abutos ear like a fucking champ]( http://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8dqxkOARr1qm3upho1_1280.png )

* Its just a quiz

I need a cigarette or something. That got surprisingly intense. I dont see this being topped for a long time.

**Ep. 143**  Poor Kagura all shook up over losing control. Merciless Kamui mowing through Tsukuyos women. I know hes only doing it for his own devious gain, but Kamuis encouragement of Seita was strangely heartfelt. Hosen is a vessel through which all suffering and pain flows. Gin confirmed S&M enthusiast. Seita embraced by the Sun. Even Hosen has some cheesy lines for us. Tama I dont want anything thats been in your mouth. Isis Gin going to dual wield? Yes! Shirt off, fight on. Hosen filling in the space needed to think and breathe. Dang, he is all about the possession of women as a right of power. OH SHIT GET STABBED RIGHT THE EYE WITH TSUKUYOS PIPE! Hey, Seita, he should probably give his full attention to Hosen because he can barely-yeah, that was why.

**Ep. 144**  Seita distraction recap. Its a bad sign when Kamui plays the voice of reason. Dammit show, you pretty much ruined this twist yourself in last episodes sendoff message. Hosens oppression rooted in destroying resilience. This has to be the longest span of time that the show has remained in the abstract with its dialog. Weird but welcome change of pace.

> My pipe isnt a cheap piece of crap. It was made by name brand Bitch

Alright, if she keeps this up Im okay with this being best girl. Objective: expose Hosen to sunlight, destroying him with that which props up everyone else. Lol did Hosen just disintegrate metal head-on? SMACK!

Oh man, the [digital broadcast switch-over](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_television_transition#Digital_switchover_at_a_glance) brings me back. Those stills.

**Ep. 145**  That is quite the obfuscated way to mention incontinence. Seems like the translator notes as back as well *thank god I would be so lost without them*. Oh hey, werent we in the middle of something? Ah, budgetary concerns. So does this acknowledgement of the outdated aspect ratio mean we can expect the switch soon^(pls)? Now *that* is a provocative DVD cover. Gintama has the best alternate route.

Kagura disposing of enemies without needing to be in the room. Hosen has got to be pure muscle mass. Kunai firing squad. OTP pending confirmation again. That Kamui spectator whistle. Lecture mode overdrive. Gin totally planned that stance out for the reveal of natural light. A cute first encounter. Well, thatsa weird form of punishment.

> Youll find that our path is empty

Liked the lack of backing sound to Hosens speech here. Driving the point home visually with Hinowas face blocking out the sun.

**Ep. 146**  That peeling skin is making me itchy from the other side of the screen. Kamui is entertained. Posing a valid question here: the Harusame can still do what they please. Declaring himself the final boss. Cant say Im surprised that Abuto is alive. Walking the empty path. Together Umibozu and Gin seem to make a complete father for Kagura. Final boss confirmed. Good ol pissed off Kagura. A change in culture. S&M obsessionwell, yeah. Cant finish things off without a little penetration.

Ginpachi-sensei! I expected a much larger amount of letters in the rejected bin.

> I cant help but expect an out-of-place recurring character to barge in and make some comment to the effect of why did everyone start talking about the sun and sky?

Each arc tends to play heavily on a specific theme and it would be amusing to see someone comment on them like that.

Agreed, my favorite battle in the series so far and Gin's not involved.

Ah one of the better arcs, my favorite still being ways away. I remember watching Gintama at 1am I started watching this arc and I didn't realize it was gonna be such a long arc but man was it worth.

Well, I finished the arc and wrote way too much about it. Over 2000 words about Yoshiwara in Flames (twice as much as I wrote last week which was probably my previous record) and enough to force me to break this into two posts. I wrote my comments on each episode before watching the next one, so some questions I have get answered later in the same post.

It also occurred to me this week that we passed the halfway point of the series last week and now I'm a little sad. Oh well, we still have a few months left. Anyway, on to the show!

---
**Episode 139** - So we lead off with a pickpocket getting bested at his own game by Gin, who immediately tries to shake down the kid in his own style. With interest!

Otose looks to be interested in starting her own thieves' guild by taking him in after Catherine. "What happened to your accent?" "It's been a while since I made an appearance so I forgot about it." That's not the first time, Catherine, step it up.

So at least Seita thinks Hinowa is his mother. I was thinking of two possible routes they could take for writing this: either he had some other reason to meet her and it's a surprise to him that she's his mother, or he suspects that's the case up front and everything's in the open, but with the optional twist after meeting that she's *not*. Glad they went with the latter; not sure on the twist yet.

Of course the kid isn't actually getting anywhere with trying to save up; did you really expect a nameless guard in the underworld of Yoshiwara to be that nice? Gin hopefully knocked some sense into him there, but I guess that drew way too much attention from the boss and the Hyakka. Interestingly Hosen never outright called Hinowa the kid's mother, all he said was allowing them to meet would be trouble. Probability of them being unrelated just went way up.

I'm beginning to see why Tsukuyo is a fan favorite even from her introduction. Will have to wait before judging her myself, though. I'm not sure how the Yato guy in the preview (also the guy showing up in the OP/ED and I'm guessing Kagura's brother) figures into all of this yet.


---
**Episode 140** - This episode was basically three scenes: Gin vehemently denying everything that just happened, Tsukuyo providing lots of exposition, and the Yato clan attack.

The first part was one joke that went on for far too long but somehow managed to remain fairly amusing for all of it. Seita getting hit anyway (by Gin deflecting it, no less) was unexpectedly funny. I was confused as to why Tsukuyo decided to play along with Gintoki's insanity up until she told the rest of the women to leave.

And then we get a backstory dump about Hinowa, Tsukuyo, and Seita to an extent. I noticed that Tsukuyo avoided calling Hinowa Seita's mother as well, so I'm guessing that confirms it. Hm.. what if Tsukuyo is his mother? She's not that young and had served as a courtesan as well, so that's my current guess. Hinowa and Tsukuyo were obviously close by then so it would make sense for her to try to help by getting the baby out of there. Not only is Tsukuyo looking out for Hinowa as a result, but her own biological son as well.

And then the bastards with umbrellas show up. Those Harusame pirates keep interrupting at the worst times, and even then they aren't the leaders so they'll remain a threat in the future. Kagura mentions that one of them is her brother, but also that he's Hosen's son? I thought that Umibouzu was their father, unless they're half-siblings. I don't remember the details from the first time all of this was brought up.

So suddenly it's very personal for Kagura. I'm looking forward to her moments of awesome later.

---
**Episode 141** - Okay, I was mistaken about Kamui being Hosen's son; I either misread it or something was off with the translation. We even get to see a little of Umibouzu in his prime (and with lots of hair) standing up to the king. That's one of the stranger resolutions to a fight I've seen but right in Gintama's style. Hosen and Kamui go all DBZ for a bit as well and that's cool, I guess. So one Yato down, 1.75 (Kamui and his remaining subordinate missing an arm) + 1 (Hosen) left after their first skirmish. Normal disclaimer I give during every big arc: I don't really care about the fights in this show, though they are impressive.

I can see why Pako and Pachi return briefly, but... Gurako? I guess she wanted to take up a new personality for those ~~melons~~ smoke bombs. Carrying over the joke about ignoring stab wounds was funnier when it expanded to include Kagura and Tsukuyo as well. I wonder if Shinpachi will also feign ignorance should he ever receive a knife to the head.

Kagura returning, kicking him through a wall, and calling herself a city girl was awesome. Like I said, looking forward to her part in this story.


---
**Episode 142**


> "The next time we meet..."  
> "It'll be underneath the sun."  
> "Perfect." 


Thank you, Odd Jobs.

Tsukuyo saved all of those women that she was supposed to kill? Yep, she's awesome. So now all of the Hyakka are on her side, I guess? She isn't looking too well, but she's not done yet I'm sure.

Shinpachi *does* get a turn at ignoring reality! Or at least Kagura complaining about him being useless.

Kagura and Shinpachi trying to fight off Abuto definitely didn't go well at first. He has a good point about Kamui fighting with his blood and Kagura fighting against it; I can definitely see that Kagura would be holding herself back to not hurt other people, even if it's not consciously. At least you tried, Shinpachi, but you should be aiming for the chest and not his arm. That's also a lot of fluids being pushed out, you might want to get that looked at.

Then Kagura snaps. Good job on the animators for making her really damn creepy-looking with that slasher smile. I'm also surprised that she can hold her own against a veteran Yato, but that's the nature of the show. Abuto has an interesting philisophical bent about these things, but I guess that's what happens when he has time to watch the captain and then compare with his little sister. A respectable death and he even gets to save another Yato at least temporarily.

(continued in a following comment)
>> ARTICLE
---
**Episode 143** - Shinpachi really did protect Kagura... from herself. Unfortunately I'm afraid the inner monster will be needed again when she meets Kamui. Speaking of which, Kamui's face while killing dozens of people: \^\_\^ - I wonder if Umibouzu ever had a creepy smile like that, considering both of his kids do.

Seita's definitely going to have PTSD after this is over, assuming makes it through alive (and he will, it's not that kind of series). Love seeing him try to break through to Hinowa, even if she wasn't really his biological mother. Really good exchange between the two of them following that.

How you know Gin's serious: he has a real sword. How you know Gin's *really* serious: he's dual-wielding. Hosen brings the pain though. While I'm not a huge fan of the fights overall, I do like watching the Yato style, integrating their umbrellas with punches and kicks. I don't imagine there's any real martial arts style similar to that, integrating an unusual implement?


---
**Episode 144** - Gin had a point, Seita. This entire trip is worthless if you and Hinowa don't get out in one piece. Though I guess it's too late for Hinowa already, considering Hosen slashed her Achilles tendons. Didn't we see her walking around earlier though?

But he tries to carry her anyway, good for you kid. Not going to get very far... unless you get help. Tsukuyo and the Hyakka come to free themselves from their cage, finally. I guess she's the kind of person to throw a knife at Gin for losing, and of course he isn't dead yet. If this were the penultimate episode of a one- or two-cour series then I'd be more concerned, but nope we're just halfway through this one. Tsukuyo trying to talk her way into a better pipe is a fun callback to Gin trying to upgrade his stolen wallet's contents back at the beginning of the arc too.

Hosen's speech about trying to bring down the sun itself is interesting, but for all that talk he really is being bested by a woman's unbreakable spirit. Sometimes you just have to move on, dude.

Ah, I see that some of the guards are still loyal to Hosen, which is bad news for Seita. Hinowa's idea to open the roof is a good one though. Would Hosen just burst into flames like a vampire? That would be fun to see.

I like how it ends on a manga-style shot. The post-ED scene about the analog switchover is kinda amusing, though I looked it up and Gintama' did run after that change so they weren't accurate there.

---
**Episode 145** - Gin once again stalling for time, eh? I guess with a limited budget you can't do awesome fights every week. And I get the complaint about still being in 4:3 but I don't mind it so much. That was also the best way to announce a new season that I've ever seen, just slipping it in nonchalantly.

Fun to see Gin go all-out for a bit even if it doesn't finish the job. Same goes for Tsukuyo and the Hyakka. Seita calls upon the Power of Friendship to flip that switch. If Hosen really wanted eternal night down there, why didn't he just destroy the control room? Come on, man, don't leave the main controls to your biggest weakness just sitting there waiting to be used by whatever intrepid hero comes along (or even a little kid, as in this case). This is material straight out of the Evil Overlord List.

I guess Hosen shriveling up works as a substitute for bursting into flames though. He gets a moment to reflect on the light and we finally get to see why he targeted Hinowa specifically. She was one of those annoying kids with a really cute voice, but she had good intentions the whole time. Well, maybe not after he locked her up forever.

Going by the preview it seems like we aren't going to get a fight between Kagura and Kamui (and it would almost certainly take longer than an episode anyway). Oh well, time to see how it ends anyway.


---
**Episode 146** - Hinowa returns in time to show Hosen the light that she wanted to long ago. The artists do a good job of making his skin drying up and shedding quite gross-looking.

Kamui's role as a spectator for the latter half of the arc is interesting since I expected him to have a larger part. While Shinpachi had the right idea in holding Kagura back, I'm a little disappointed we don't get to see that fight yet. Oh well, more hype for whenever they do face off.

Good to see that Abuto survived, I like his thoughtful approach. Unless Kamui's about to kill him, that is; I wouldn't put it past him to kill a subordinate for showing a little sympathy. Nope, back to the Harusame with them.

Humor returns with Umibouzu and Gin trying to outdo each other. I forget, was there an episode earlier where we found out what happened with Kagura's family? I feel for her if she just wants her old brother back.

Yoshiwara's just another ~~town~~ red light district now, I guess. And like Shinpachi, I knew *exactly* what "toy store" Seita was working at was implying. I bet the animators had fun drawing a kid running around with a pixelated sex toy in each hand. Shinpachi finally gets his own knife to the forehead too!

Oh hey, episode 42 had the flashback. Thanks, Ginpachi-sensei! I guess I can go rewatch that one now.

---
Okay, overall this is the best arc of the show so far: an interesting setting in Yoshiwara, a good villain in Hosen, a wild card and strong tie to a main character in Kamui, a new ally in Tsukuyo and I won't be surprised if Seita and Hinowa return again as well.

I don't know if I can call it my new *favorite* story, though, considering how inclined I am toward romance which was lacking here. There was a good deal of familial love though, and there was a great contrast here that one of the characters (Gin, I think?) pointed out: family is a lot more than blood (Hinowa/Seita), and even when you are biologically related you may not have much of a connection or even dislike it (Kagura/Kamui). It's a good theme for an arc and they executed it well.

As far as action goes, I mentioned above that I really like the Yato style so it was more entertaining for me than a lot of past fights. Seeing Kagura in full rage mode is *scary*. Looking forward to more Tsukuyo in the future though she isn't best girl, sorry.

Whew, it's over. See you next week when we're back to normal episodes.

Yatos with their Chinese traditional outfits and fighting with umbrellas remind me of Once Upon a Time in China series. The kung fu master in those films fights with various everyday objects, the umbrella being the most iconic. Perhaps Sorachi took his inspiration here.

That one fake new Gintama trailer Kagura made up in episode 50 was titled "GinTama: Once Upon A Time In China Musume", so I'd say your guess could be correct.

[Happy Cake Day!](http://minus.com/lbkv8fzo7EG0Gq)

Impressive write-up. It wouldn't feel justified unless Odd Jobs faces Final Boss Kamui in Yoshiwara. That, and it's the red-light district as you said. Of course the staff wants to animate more of that. We'll see it again soon.

But who is best girl?
>> ARTICLE
> Happy Cake Day!

Thanks! I should bump K-On! up my priority list as it's always looked like a show I'd really enjoy.

> It wouldn't feel justified unless Odd Jobs faces Final Boss Kamui in Yoshiwara.

I dunno, Kamui never seemed interested in Yoshiwara itself but rather Hosen who had built his base of power there. Kamui's out to kill Gintoki for sure but I doubt the location will really matter to anyone. That said, I'm sure we'll see more of it for the other reasons you mentioned.

> But who is best girl?

I don't know anymore! In something resembling but not exactly a ranking:

* Sacchan was best girl for a long time but she's faded to the background and even acknowledged as much.
* If Kyubei makes more appearances she has a good chance to take over since I'm curious where her character development can go.
* Tama's great and just needs more screen time.
* Tsukuyo had a fantastic introduction in this arc, but as with Kyubei I'm wondering what she'll do after this.
* Kagura doesn't count for me because she's in the main trio.
* Otose's awesome but... is it bad if I disqualify her for being too *old*? Best woman, maybe.
* Otae's fun but loses points for cooking.
* Catherine... no. Same goes for Otsu.
* Kirara has a high chance if she becomes a regular since she's one of the few scholarly characters, but I doubt that'll happen.

As ED and OP goes, nothing has changed.

As for episodes, 142 will probably stay in my memory now!

Everybody said about about getting a new best girl this arc and while I agree that Tsukuyo was great (especially in her comedic parts), this arc only made me appreciate Kagura more! And sadly there was no Katsura in this arc.

But yeah, I wholeheartedly agree that Yoshiwara in Flames is definetely the best arc in Gintama so far! In the first 2 eps it reminded me of the classic Gintama arcs with its gags but it evolved into a great story! 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm.. I don't think much has shifted. Don't like the OP that much, ED is in the upper half but not top 3.

Solid episodes in the arc but none of them stand out (and again, the fights themselves don't interest me as much). Tsukuyo is good but not best girl (yet).

Yoshiwara is the best long arc so far, but I don't know if I can call it my favorite over a couple of the shorter ones I listed last week. They're different beasts and hard to compare.
>> ARTICLE
**OP**: Hasn't changed. I'm not a fan of the current OP.

**ED**: No change, though I do enjoy the current ED and it fit in surprisingly well with the seriousness of Yoshiwara.

**Episode**: 142 will be up there. My current list of noteworthy episodes are [in broadcast order]:

25, 34, 38, 43, 44, 50, 61, 75, 79, 82, 87, 95, 99, 111, 112, 115, 125, 142.

**Character**: I haven't been torn away from Kagura yet, but I can definitely see Tsukuyo becoming the romantic lead.

**Arc**: I'd concede to Yoshiwara as the best. I wasn't very committed to any other arc as rising above the rest, but this one caught my attention in ways that others haven't, down to Yoshiwara itself as a gorgeous set piece.
>> ARTICLE
Shinpachi does not look pleased in that bonus art.

**Ep. 119**  Being Hijikata is suffering. The music and the death glares he got while wandering around town blended nicely. Wouldnt have pegged Matsudaira for caring about the environment. Explosions are bad for your health too. Gintama too edgy with cigarettes on DVD covers. You can have this last cigaretteafter you listen to my tear-jerking story. These little exchanges between planets are killing me. Thank you for interrupting the narration, Hijikata. Lets not get fully dragged down in the DBZ framework. Nearly dry heaved at the ooey-gooey ball. Grillin no! Hijikata plowing through hundreds of episodes of villains. This wish for panties is why we cant have nice things. Prince Baka was made for this Majin Buu role.

**Ep. 120**

Still wondering how Katsura even puts his pants on in the morning. Is it just me or did the Prince Baka insert song get crazier? Curious as to what world the zipper is the window to. Youshouldprobably put down that charm point, Katsura. Of all people, Baka is challenging Katsuras principles. The episode has gone full-on Saturday morning special. Are we just going to ignore that monstrosity that is the New Prince? That exit.

If theres one thing that I consider infallible, its Hasegawas eventual failure. Beyond Tamas repair is beyond any repair. This off-screen gag. Not how I would have wanted Tama to save the day. Dear lord, this riff raff looksinteresting. Hijikatas gradual build up in anger over that curry, love him. I would not want to be on the receiving end of that ice cold stare. 

**Ep. 121**  Ginpachi-sensei! Gintama doesnt need to accomplish anything. Its fine floundering about in my book.

Good to know that cattle abductions pervade across cultures. Oh. Shinpachi. Get that looked at. The effects they used on the saucer, Im dying. Not putting much care into beeping out PSP. Kagura has become the mascot character. Oh. Gin. Oh.Gin. He got it rough this arc. Really liking this frantic joystick-less Gin. Game trailer looks intense. Shinpachi dont fall for that ploy! Gin-sannnnnnn! Awesome avatar, Kagura. Hunger defying game logic.

More Ginpachi-sensei! Poor Wakanabe. Id absolutely give you a hug.

**Ep. 122**  Never thought Id see Fruit Punch Samurai again (glad). CrunchyRoll had to remind us of the Kondo-Katsura encounter (amused). Please let that be Sacchan (desire). Whoa, that eyecatch came out of nowhere (surprise). Reclaiming Hunters Paradise (suave). Aliens too OP (jealousy). Smegmaman or Master Bayter (lol). Weve seen Kondo naked far too many times (disgust). DidKagura just harvest his dick (baffled)? The moment the alien lit up a cigarette, there was no doubt it was Hijikata (resolve).

> How many weeks is it going to take to get my dick back?

(dead)

**Ep. 123**  Hey, hows it going recap? My mind immediately went to [Kaiki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFFeYLmEARw) when I saw the exterior shots of the Korean BBQ. Not putting much care into beeping out dick. Katsura confirmed incompetent. Poor Kondo, cant catch a break with these arranged marriages. The driver puns are real. Sacchan on a mission to save Gins dick. This serious prose, like that offline meeting was a huge turning point of character. Its as if the staff is using every insert song in its arsenal during this solemn bit. And Sacchan bringing us back to tissue-filled reality. Gin you cut her off as she was saying something *important* about her nipples. Screwdriver infiltration! Show. Please. I cant. Gins light emitting dick dissembling the ships main brain.

Cicada > Mosquito > Madao

**Ep. 124**  Liquor liquor liquor liquor. Voice of a generation. How does one use a CD for propagating? Bansai might as well be indestructible if he only suffered that minor of an injury during the Crisis Arc. Beginning to adore Otsu: her scheming face, her ghetto behavior, her pouting. The WWE is one degree away from this theatrical boxing. 

> Im a manufactured pop idol

Well that was a surprisingly serious and adept revelation. OH MY GOD ITS AN ODD JOBS CENTAUR REPRISAL! Haruna please literally no one cares.

> Who cares about broadcast regulations?

Okay maybe not the voice of a generation. Maybe the voice of the shows staff. Heh, Slightly Feverish Continent couldnt find another interesting minor character, eh? 

Ginpachi-sensei! School girl Kyuubei. This show gets me. Dont die, Kyuubei! I think weve all done something very similar to this before. 

More Ginpachi-sensei? Show, you really do spoil me. [John Mulaney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uD-akXggZA) might disagree with you on Home Alone 2, Kondo. Next episode is a multiple of 25. Bring on the insanity.

I just figured that when this gintama rewatch ends, I'm gonna lose one of the best times I'm having every week. Gintama is great and I think I've never laughed so hard with any other medium before, be it TV series or movie or another anime. 

I'm glad onurtag started this weekly thread because I always wanted to watch Gintama but I never had the courage or the time to do it. Thank you bro, you made my week infinitely better.

I also would like to thank the guys (don't remembers names sorry) that post their thoughts for every episode each week. Their post are hilarious and I really look forward to them every week.

Last, and I think I speak for every lurker here such as myself, without every poster's help, this discussion wouldn't be a thing now and I would have never enjoyed this masterpiece. Thank you and please continue this thread (I'll try to be active now)! :)

Not enough time? Watch Gintama on public transit while commuting to work. Problem solved, but now I can't laugh out loud like I do with a lot of the show (and hope no one's watching over my shoulder for the weirder parts).

**Episode 119** - Poor Hijikata, can't find anywhere to smoke. I really didn't expect the DBZ parody to go on for as long as it did, but it was pretty amusing the entire way through.

**Episode 120** - Hata's a fun character to pick on. The idea of an Amanto-only restaurant is interesting and gives yet another glimpse at the larger societal issues that I enjoyed early in the series.

**Episode 120.5** - Hasegawa is really good at cucumber rolls. At least that's something? I'd love to have a go at the giant tuna nigiri Kagura made. Loved the bit at the end with Kondo and Hijikata.

**Episode 121** - Ooh, new character in the intro in place of Ito in the intro. Wonder who that is. Never played Monster Hunter myself but the culture of multiplayer games like that carry across from one to another pretty well so it's still really funny. Of course Gin was playing a girl, but it makes sense (can vouch that female characters get a lot more attention, wanted or not).

**Episode 122** - And the Monster Hunter arc rolls on. Turns out it's Hasegawa's character that's in the opening now, didn't expect that.

**Episode 123** - And the end of the Monster Hunter story, with Gin finally getting to screw something. Not a bad arc, but again I haven't played the series so I probably missed out on some of the fun.

**Episode 124** - Otsu makes a return. Not my favorite character but still funny. Loved seeing the centaur return along with corpse-chan; it's just absurd and yet no one bats an eye. "Who Cares About Broadcast Regulations" indeed! Her original version fit with the opening quite well. Going to miss the OP/ED from this run.

I wrote way too much so lets get to BENIZAKURA WEEK!


**Ep. 56**  Odd Jobs centaur? Gin really got into character in his lamenting the accidental shooting of Kagura. A symbol of tragedy indeed. I will never tire of Hijikata and Okita verbally assaulting each other. What an intense line of negotiationsthrough cue cards. Nicely handled, Shinsengumi.


**Ep. 57**  Even the show is like Sakamoto? Whos that? Oh, that guy in the opening. Who the hell would want stock in a private limited company called Evil Organization? A giant Justaway tank with a Neil Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon crotch. What more could a man ask for? Oh man, that preview. Benizakura. Its happening.


**Ep. 58**  BENIZAKURA IS HERE! This introductory monologue and accompanying music is doing a good job upping the excitement.


> Its time tobegin our legend


Pulling no punches setting up multiple narratives and taking down Katsura.


> Hes not dead, hes Katsura  Credit to [HarleyQuinzelz](http://www.crunchyroll.com/user/HarleyQuinzelz)


Elizabeth setting things into motiononce she is understood and only after driving Gin out. A lot of characters are hard of hearing in this arc apparently. Oh shit, Elizabeth talked! And she sounds vaguely like the director from episode 50. I feel like Gintama has parodied Golgo 13 a handful of times. Worth checking out? Wait, Nizo the Butcher isnt dead? I must suck at remembering these details.


> Did this turn into a different anime?


I know, right? This fight is so different from everything else weve seen so far. Gin took a Benizakura to the torso and Shinpachi sliced a limb like a badass. Even Kagura is getting down to business and shaking down Takasugi with her umbrella.
 

**Ep. 59**  MORE BENIZAKURA! Oh Kagura, delaying a fight for an underwear insult. Best girl. Holy shit, when did Oishi of Higurashi get here? This fight scene looks pretty damn awesome. I want to take Elizabeth seriously when shes mourning but its hard not to laugh. Deaf swordsmith double-cross! Weve got every villain from the ED in this Kiheitai group. Seriously, Im having a hard time un-hearing Oishi when this guy talks. Im going to keep referring to him as Oishi.


> Youre the most suspicious person Ive ever seen in my life


Were those explosive loogies? When did Elizabeth get a cannon? Gin looks brooding even while holding a bright bunny umbrella.


**Ep. 60**  EVEN MORE BENIZAKURA. This refrain is so badass. Jesus, this is AoT-level recap. Get to it Gintama! So we spent a lot of time getting the majority of the forces to converge on Takasugis ship and doing the necessary reconciliations. In the meantime, we see Nizo tear shit up after licking his fucking lips. I hate that so many shows do this stupid bit. It was unnecessary in Brotherhood, Chaika, here, and any other show that does it. /rant.


> Can you compare it to something Im more familiar with?


Cannot wait to see Gin deliver some beatdowns. Oh my god its the crazy shit-eating grins that Ive seen countless times before picking this show up. Ending on the setup for fights. Hype ensuing!


**Ep. 61**  Chopped up ED because we have beatdowns to deliver! These fighting sequences are such a step up from what weve been shown before. Oishi and Shinpachi much less epic. Take note from best girl catching bullets right next to you. Nizo has gone straight-up berserker.


> See how powerful the things you call meaningless can be


Harusame pirates? Damn show, that was a group introduced in episode 13. I had to go look that up. Nice little teaser into Takasugi, Katsura, and Gins past. Elizabeth parachute!


And so Benizakura concludes. Im glad that this arc ended openly, setting up the Kiheitai as an oppositional force that we can return to when the time is right; there simply wasnt enough time to delve into the dynamic between Takasugi, Katura, and Gin that would be required for a nice, neat conclusion where the bad guys die. Im liking the differing perspectives were being shown on the condition of Edo, though simple, present the state of affairs as complicated and arduous to overcome. Welcomed departure from the standard offerings of the series. Having a few arcs with this tone peppered here and there will keep my interest elevated.

I discovered this weekly Gintama threads yesterday and think that this is a great way to see what other people think about the series.
As someone who loves Gintama and thinks that it is one of the best Anime ever created i instantlly began to read all the weekly Gintama threads to date and think that your "in-depth" descriptions for every episode are really great.

In one of the threads some weeks ago you stated something about that most of the recurring cast was introduced, but there are still some characters coming that are great additions to the show.
[This is a spoiler about when they approximately appear and nothing more, not who it is or any relationships.](/s "Three characters will be introduced in the course of the next month. Meaning one in week 2, 3 and 4 from now on. After that it will be around episode 140 and two more a really far from now on after episode 200. I hope to not say to much, but one of these characters will ensure that it will get hilarious and insane, everytime this character appers, just as you like it as far as i can read it out of your comments.")

(Sorry if my english is not that great, but it is not my native language.)
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you enjoy my silly half-baked commentary. It's a fun show to engage with in this manner, especially in the context of the watch group.


[](/s "Good to know the cast will expand in the future. The show has a decent track record of introducing new recurring characters and utilizing them well for gags were appropriate, with Hedero being a good example.")
>> ARTICLE
Katsura's catchphrase really does work for everything.

I actually never realized Takechi had Oishi's voice. Now I won't unhear it either for both of their roles.

>> You're the most suspicious person I've ever seen in my life

this line is so true hahahah Elizabeth....

You will see more of the Harusame pirates in the future, so remember them now :>
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the heads up on the pirates. I'll have to commit that to memory.
>> ARTICLE
That was pretty awesome.

Are there major differences between the episodes and the movie version of the Benizakura arc? I watched the movie and was wondering if I missed anything.
>> ARTICLE
The movie version is pretty much the same, except that it's abbreviated in the film (with a ton of scenes removed) and the budget cranked up in a few places.  Otherwise, it's exactly the same.  The only real difference is that there's an opening and ending segment that has nothing to do with the arc and is just typical Gintama 4th wall breaking.  IMO, it isn't a very good movie and not really worth watching.  The 2nd film however, it's basically night and day how different they are.  2nd film is all original and might be the best Jump-film ever made.
>> ARTICLE
You missed the narrations by nizo and a couple jokes, generally speaking you didnt.
>> ARTICLE
Ok good to know. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Always loved these group of episodes. Maybe its the music and sword shattering but "a sword that protects" always gets me. 



Anyways was the yagyuu arc really that long? I don't remember guess i only watched it once. More interested in the Tama arc anyways.
>> ARTICLE
sorry for the late reply  
Yagyuu arc is 6 episodes long but if we had to do something else it would be 7 + 1+6 (moving 1 episode to previous week)  
I thought it would be confusing so I didn't do it
>> ARTICLE
The music in the Benizakura arc really sets the mood. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm on episode 12 but I'll catch up fast. :)
>> ARTICLE
Godspeed, hope you show up next week
>> ARTICLE
I tried to watch this for the first time and then pace myself for these discussions...but..i..couldn't stop watching gintama man.

Woo here I am almost on time!

I mentioned this last week but for me 56 is one of the funniest episodes of the series.  Whenever I'm thinking of rewatching an episode 56 is one of the first that comes to my mind.  Gintoki as Makoto with dead Kagura on his back just cracks me up too much.

I definitely enjoy seeing Sakamoto again.  I like how they include Oryou but in Gintama Sakamoto has Mutsu!  I really like Gintoki's relationship with Sakamoto (and Katsura too!) because on one level it seems like they don't get along at all but on another level it's clear that their relationship is deep.  It was funny when they seemed like they were going to have a cool moment but they ended up running in to each other instead.

As for the Benizakura arc I don't really have too much to say about it except for that Takasugi really confuses me, I have a hard time understanding him at all.  I liked the part in the beginning when they went to see the sword smiths and the brother acted like he couldn't hear Gintoki but then he threw a hammer at him when he called him stupid.

For me what makes Gintama work so well is BOTH the funny episodes and the serious arcs.  The funny episodes make me like and appreciate the characters so when something serious happens I care about what happens to to them.  But sometimes I get sick of all the silliness so the serious arcs are nice too.
>> ARTICLE
Benizakura is tbh my least favourite serious arc in the series even though I really liked it the first time I watched it because I didn't expect it coming at all. Things sure got serious fast.. First Katsura and then Gintoki in a single episode! On my first run through I had no idea Gintama even got this serious. I love this arc simply for the inclusion of Katsura and Takasugi, though. Also, the buildup on the ship with Kagura pointing her umbrella at Takasugi is still a pretty intense moment. I gotta say I love Takasugi's creepy pupil-dilating faces.

Definitely looking forward to Yagyuu. The immediate next episodes are going to be fun too. It's back to comedy Gintama! I think what's missing from this arc is the comedy that later serious action arcs manage to still blend in.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 56** - Not as funny as I was hoping for. It took me a while to realize that the centaur was the main trio and was wondering why they hadn't shown up yet.

**Episode 57** - I'll admit I was dozing through most of this one. Sakamoto kinda annoys me so I was okay with that.

**Episode 58** - Okay, beginning of the Benizakura arc and even the show is building it up. Apparently Otsu's manager is involved somehow? Nizo returns but is apparently some kind of tentacle monster who supposedly but almost certainly didn't kill Katsura. Shinpachi gets a moment of awesome in saving Gin! And finally the guy that's been featured in the ending opposite Gintoki shows up. I'm interested but not enthralled.

**Episodes 59-61** - Kagura is a badass and we meet the other enemies that appear in the ending. A living sword, eh? Reminds me of Soul Calibur. Not a lot to say on the rest because, honestly, I found it kinda boring. I don't watch Gintama for its action and if the entire show was like this I would have stopped long before now. It wasn't a bad story, just not what I like to watch.

That said, I was immediately looking forward to watching more after finishing it because I do like the series as a whole and they have comedic and sweet episodes that really scored high for me.
>> ARTICLE
u couldnt figure out the centaur was them?....
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't paying much attention during that one.
>> ARTICLE
I guess you are in luck serious action arcs are far and few. 
>> ARTICLE
Episode 1 and 2 are considered the worst episodes of the entire series and generally are recommended to skip. 

You are in for a hell of a ride if you liked them already.
>> ARTICLE
i've seen many people attribute the first two episodes as being "the worst", but that doesn't make any sense. they're literally like every other episode of Gintama.


i didn't like them when i first watched them, but the many times that i watched them again were fantastic.


the reason why they aren't is probably because the viewer likely doesn't know the characters at all. half of my enjoyment of this series comes from my love for the characters.


honestly, if I had to pick the "worst" episodes, it'd be easy for me to pick literally every episode of the new season except for the first.
>> ARTICLE
For some reason when watching Gintama I skipped some episodes at the beginning and went back to them after finishing the rest and I definitely noticed them being worse despite knowing the characters quite well.
>> ARTICLE
Was thinking about skipping them since I seen some people say it's filler stuff, but I just decided to just watch it
>> ARTICLE
Majority of the stuff in Gintama is filler anyways. But honestly, just treat them as something that helps the character grow into you and that's definitely a good thing, as the characters in Gintama really makes the show.

Edit : Filler like episodes is what I meant.
>> ARTICLE
That's how I felt for Naruto before it got *waaay* out of hand. Will most likely watch everything
>> ARTICLE
1-2, 50, 57, 75, 82, 106, 111, 114, 120, 124-125, 135, 137, 150, 155, 164, 166, 171, 173-174, 176, 185, 189, 209, 252

26 filler out of 305 episodes. That's pretty damn good considering half of those blatantly tell us so and several you wouldn't even realize if you didn't look it up. 
>> ARTICLE
I never really looked up which episodes they labeled as filler really. I mean, most of them are quite similar to what the rest of the show are at times that I didn't put too much thinking on it o.o
>> ARTICLE
It's actually 9% filler.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose I should have phrased it as filler-like instead of filler lol.
>> ARTICLE
Just realize that the first 2 episodes will put you somewhere in the middle of the story. The 3rd episode starts at the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Ah I see. Thanks for the heads up!
>> ARTICLE
So what you're saying is, it's painful at first, but after a few more times, you'll be constantly wanting more?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they were as bad as the hard boiled detective episode. 
>> ARTICLE
My god I had to take a break from the anime when I first reached this arc. Those episodes were unbearable but I didn't want to skip episodes. Probably the only good part of that arc to me was [spoiler?](/s "the moving floor where they had to save the family")
>> ARTICLE
Yea the second episode in that arc was *ok*, but that first one was absolutely horrible. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the hard boiled arc was garbage
>> ARTICLE
[Even hard boiled arc had it's good moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7ehZiaplSE)

Holy shit that's genius XD. I need to watch Gintama now.

Thanks! Will keep this in mind

you started at a good time, its possible that the manga and anime both finish in 2016, you can ride the hype train right at the end
>> ARTICLE
Oh that's good to know! 
>> ARTICLE
Just take it with a pinch of salt. Gintama manga actually feels like it's wrapping up a lot of stuff right now and is supposed to enter it's final arc next year. But Bleach entered it's final arc like 3-4 years ago...
>> ARTICLE
Is it confirmed final arc? Or is moreso just a really long arc? 
>> ARTICLE
It's really just rumors right now. There was an article on [crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/12/20/gintama-manga-may-be-enter-its-final-arc) yesterday about it.
>> ARTICLE
Aw, it looks like it is the final arc. And then they start focusing on tying things up D:

Thanks for the info :)
>> ARTICLE
Prepare for tears of laughter and sadness.
>> ARTICLE
was also hesitant due to episode count and wasn't impressed with episode one but stuck through it and now 69 episodes later and loving it, keeps getting better and better 
>> ARTICLE
I was just saying how the beginning of ep 69 made me crack up so hard!

>> ARTICLE
trash day was hilarious 

The OP's and ED's are awesome, love all of them so far 
>> ARTICLE
I think that's pretty much the way it goes for most people who get through those earlier, slower episodes.

It gets sooo much better though, so enjoy! :)
>> ARTICLE
I recently also popped my Gintama cherry and I'm already up to ep 149. I found it funny and wild for the first few episodes, but nothing particularly WOWing until they start getting to the actual arcs [](/s "Jumped on the hype train of no return with the Benizakura arc"). THEN, I said to myself "okay, I see where the hype comes from". 

>> ARTICLE
/u/enfermedad is right. You ain't seen nothing yet.
>> ARTICLE
The next few episodes that you're going to watch are some of my all-time favorites, without spoiling anything.
>> ARTICLE
I just love how Gintama pretty much has a licence to do anything. It's a bit like how if something inexplicable happens in Harry Potter and they're like "Magic", for Gintama their answer is "Aliens". 


One of my most memorable moments where I just cracked up in stitches laughing was [ep. 69](/s "Gin goes to take out the trash in the middle of the night and he is so scared after watching some messed up PSA with heads in the garbage. He starts yelling and singing and his neighbour reacts like any normal person and tells him to STFU. THEN Gin asks him to watch his back while he takes the trash and the neighbour was just like "WTF, that's fucking creepy!". Nekminnit, you see Tama's head and Gin just KOs. Just rewatched that clip and started laughing again")
>> ARTICLE
just so you know, the more common term is "popped" 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I just realized that now. It was around 3 AM where I'm at, cut me some slack lol
>> ARTICLE
good now be sad because it is coming to an end soon. Gorilla make an "official" statement :(

Well Gorilla isn't exactly what you call "civilized". I like to think of him as "special".

I'm on Episode 28 right now and its been pretty good so far.  Episode 25 is my favorite as of now.

I'm in the same boat as you and I can't seem to get off now

That's it, I'll dive, you seem to be the only one here who cares about and is interested in gintama *without* having any real interest in actually watching it, why is that?

I can easily understand why people would end up disliking it, hating it, enjoying it or loving it, but you don't seem to hate it or dislike it, but you still haven't given it a chance, which I wouldn't find weird if it wasn't for the fact that you seem to enjoy seeing and talking about gifs and videos of stuff that happens in the show.

same here dude after watchin Gintama in sleep paralysis i couldnt help but laugh so hard and thought 'i must see this'  
im on episode 17 at the moment

edit: it's nice to see more people sucked into Gintama and be sure to skip episodes 58-61 and to watch the movie remake of those episodes instead.

So I recently started watching JoJos Bizarre Adventure and I was pleasantly surprised when I started hearing Sugitas glorious voice as Joseph Joestar himself, it also helps that both JoJo and Gin are kind of similar in personality but I feel that Gin needs to look more manly now to keep up. Anyway enough about JoJo this is a Gintama thread. Also Kintama arc hype!

**Episode 244 ** The  paper airplane reminded me of ef which is a great show if you've never seen it. [Fo shizzle!](http://i.imgur.com/qIrXhV9.png) Ill go beast on your ass.

I wonder if that is the Japanese stereotype of all Americans. Hijikata lecture mode! You picked the wrong guy to mess with Tesunosuke. A rapoff? Wheres Katsura when you need him. And our antagonist Isaburo gets introduced. Those chewing sounds were rather uncomfortable. [Needs more blushing.](http://i.imgur.com/kD5LMw2.png) Seems that basketball caught on.

I really enjoyed this arc more than most but I am a little biased towards the Shinsengumis arcs because who doesnt love getting some backstory on them.

**Episode 248 ** [I saw a GIF of this scene before.](http://i.imgur.com/t1DE8z6.png) Why is Hasegawa looking at his flashback in the 3rd person perspective? That question answered itself.

That was one of the more memorable episodes. The CR comments share the same sentiment as I do when I say that I would like to see something go Hasegawas way just once. If I ever had a criticism for the show it would be centered Hasegawas character. Do I see ~~Saber~~ Gedomaru in that preview?

**Episode 249 ** Live action Shinpachi huh? I can dig it. Pretty cool Gundam statue outside what I assume to be the Sunrise studio. Nice callback to the Onmyoji arc.

Was that Santa in the crowd of charging demons? So Gedomaru learned the meaning of giving presents and the Yorozuya trio are stuck in the Demon world. Alls well that ends well I guess. Those t-shirts are rather cute. Ok the final part whoosed right by me.

> I want your ass
	
Shes a feisty one. [Now kiss](http://i.imgur.com/RfNm1Y5.png). I dont think that gun is included in the Bushido, Isaburo. Hijikata no! What is this, junior high? No one cares if you read the letter, gangster terrorist leader challenging the combined forces of the Mawarigumi and Shinsengumi. I love how Hijikata can only express himself directly through a letter. MOTHERFUCKING BULLET SPLICE! Seems weird for Gin to have stood around doing nothing for so long in the midst of things. That helicopter just gonna chill there or? [Now kiss](http://i.imgur.com/1FFw6H7.png).

*****

**Ep. 247**  Hopefully the last Tetsu recap Ill have to endure. Lol again with actual recap after the OP. Its not a serious display of power unless someone takes down a helicopter. How the hell did Kondo fire an RPG with that curvature?

[Dick Entry  4:42  Bystander  Okita](http://i.imgur.com/WNVov0N.png)

*Pah~.* Weve lost Yamazaki to anpan, guys. At least hes putting it to use. I mean, you *could have* greased the pole or something, Kondo. Cool guys eat mayo during explosions. New insult: sheath. This is why you shouldnt just stand around for two episodes, Isaburo. What the hell is an "elite thorn"? Poor Gin. "Model citizen". Pretty sure he doesnt sort his trash properly. Dont care that you caused the crisis, Tetsu. Take responsibility for the recap. Bullet wounds finally got to Hijikata. [We have another donut lover, guys](http://33.media.tumblr.com/b2d1170a22472841282e50ae5912d013/tumblr_n1jmd4I3o51qh8u1do1_500.gif). Sup Takasugi? Speaking in metaphor and verbally motioning toward some large-scale evil plot? Expected no less. You can do better than associating yourself with Isaburo though. Otoses insight seems to work on Hijikata: sometimes its easier to convey yourself in text. Part of me wants Hijikata to grow out the ponytail again. Ooh, neat little trick there for the AMV. Really liked the sequence at the very end with Hijikata trekking through the thicket.

Ginpachi-sensei! Can confirm, have a few friends who are in the process of quitting.

*****

**Ep. 248**  Gintama acknowledges the current year. Uh oh, Hatsu is gonna see this shameful display. 

[Dick Entry  4:32  Hasegawa  Hasegawa](http://i.imgur.com/Bg6S0kY.png)

Youre supposed to think out loud, Hasegawa. Youre creating dead air on TV! Well, there goes the nice series of backstories. Lol Sorachi is an answer option. Taking a downer turn it seems. Sidebar: I want that Kagura sticker. Oh my god, can primetime television be this depressing? Jokes on you, host. Im not watching this during regular broadcasting. 

> I dont want to learn how pathetic I am

Jesus Christ, I did not expect this from the PV. Ah! Shes out in the park with Hasegawa! I didnt want this!

> I was supposed to be helping her smile

Show, Im seriously going to tear up. Stoppit! Its as if Hasegawa witnesses the suffering of others *because* he exists at the bottom rung of society and takes it upon himself to boost them out of that chasm at his own expense. Oh shit Hasegawa pulled a [John Carpenter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI2SXUzMFtQ). Cant ever win.

Were getting more *gonsansu~*!

**Ep. 249**  Live action Gintama! Sweet Gundam statue. 

[Dick Entry  3:34  Gintoki  Kagura](http://i.imgur.com/IeCoPx7.png)

*Saber!* TIL Saber and Gedomaru share [the same VA](http://myanimelist.net/people/13/Ayako_Kawasumi). Kagura remembers the important jokes. Gedomaru knows how to get Gins attention. "In these demon days / Its so cold outside". Present hunting in the demon world.  [Guess Im not sleeping tonight](http://i.imgur.com/fX9b6lz.png). Its okay, Shinpachi. *We* understand the *tsukkomi*.

Even Kagura couldnt get down a Pandemonium. Shh, demon merchant, dont ruin the sweet moment. Damn, I bet Gedomaru *could* take on the devil. Odd Jobs, not so much. They should rock T-shirts more often. 
	
Pandemonium in the air. I see what you did there, show. ~~Shinpachi x Kagura~~. My ears!! Make it stop!!
	
*****

**Ep. 250**  These two have become one of my favorite father-daughter pairs. Can relate to the "its free so I want it" mentality. Youre overselling the theatrics, Gin. Shell totally pick up on a DBZ reference. The face of shame.

[Dick Entry  7:35  General  Gintoki](http://i.imgur.com/7QpqQMx.png)

Kagura is not having any shit today. Couldnt find Tamas birthday on the Wikipedia page but the [Wikia](http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Tama_%E3%81%9F%E3%81%BE) references her age based on what she says in this episode. *Die!* Im liking the more and more frequent visits from Tsukky. Nice golden vagina metaphor, Seita. So when I was a kid, thats what adults were doing under their coughs? Elizabeth simply destroys. Thank you for vetoing the Kyuubei & Tojo bullshittery, Kagura. Hasegawa Mobius strip of darkness and blu-wraith-level depravity. Sacchan do you really think youre going to get what you want in this show and timeslot? Yup, Odd Jobs should not be allowed to manage or even touch money.

*****
Not a huge fan of Thorny. It lacked the impact to pull through its dull foundation. However, Im all for more Nobume and the Miwarigumi somehow being tied into Takasugis I Simply Destroy Until The Beast Stops Howling super evil ultimate plan. Anyway, Im pretty sure Sorachi wrote the arc to make a few "thorn in my side" jokes. Thankfully the one-offs balanced things out for the week. I dont know if Im eager to inflict emotional pain upon myself or if Hasegawas stories of propping up those falling into the chasm are getting better and better.

###Time To Dick

Let me know if youd like to contribute to backlog and Ill block off some episodes for you.

Let's see how fast I can get through these! Had very little time to write this week and next week I'm not even sure I'll be able to get through them all since I'm going to be busy with a convention ^(PAX East)for most of the time.

**Ep. 244** - This thug Tetsuno, apparently making the Shinsengumisuffer by forcing him onthem because his dad's a member of the elite. Mmm, nepotism. I could see him handling himself in a brawl, but maybe he just talks big. Hijikata is not amused. Nice fantasy about doing whatever you want to him, Toshi.

Uh.. curry's now a drug? And rice?Poor Yamazaki, for once he wasn't going for anpan. Curry in the pocket. Lecture mode Hijikata? That's new. Tetsu has brother issues, got it.

Uh oh, I recognize that scooter. Wrong person to pick on, Tetsu. Rap battle! I didn't know Gin could throw down like that. Uh oh, Mimawarigumi here. Cheese it! Isaburois Testu's brother and the guy that reminded me of Itou,got it.

He clearly rubs Hijikata the wrong way even more than Tetsu does, so looks like it'll be brother vs. brother and police vs. police? Thorny boys, eh.

[What.](http://i.imgur.com/POmWDqg.png) I can't take that seriously. Hey, Tetsu respects Hijikata now, timefor him totake a turn. And Kondo explains the Thorny thing and we finally get a lot about Hijikata's past, nice. [Little demon](http://i.imgur.com/qJWfzBM.png) he was. [Nice advice.](http://i.imgur.com/4kZBCM9.png)

---
**Ep. 245** - Sepia-toned rap recap? I'll take it. Huh, Sougo freeing Gin from jail. Gin has the best response with a ball and chain. Isaburo has a job for Gin? This should be interesting and I can't see this ending well for Isaburo.

Testu training montage? Or just a sandwich. Don't call him Thorny again, he will stab you. At least there's an errand he can run... delivering to Hijikata's brother? Oooh.

Gin's infiltrating the Joi? Uh oh. And of course they're set to grab Tetsu. More teasing of another popularity poll. Wow, clingy texter much?

And now everyone's at the scene and the cops are about to tear each other apart. Well, Isaburo just wants to kill all the terrorists (and his brother) and Hijikata's out to stop them. Oooh, who's that girl? Looks like Sougo has a rival.

---
**Ep. 246** - I didn't get a screenshot of this earlier, but [hnnngh Kyubei](http://i.imgur.com/5NEbYM8.png) in theOP. Sorry Tsukuyo, you're down to #2 now. Speaking of the OP, thisthinghas been stuck in my head all week so I guess I can say it's one of my favorites now. ^(Ever Ever Ever Ever)

Rosy vs. Thorny! Man, that's an awesome fight. I don't know if they've gotten better or I've just gotten used to it, but I'm looking forward to these kinds of epic confrontations now.

[Sougo's got a girlfriend?](http://i.imgur.com/Vo9MvEP.png) Well, one that wants to kill him. I can't see him wanting anything else though.

Ooh, secret message for Isaburo? Saying that Tetsu's growing, aww. And asking for them to make up, because it's too late for Hijikata and his brother.

Don't forget about Gin! He's cleaning house up there. Lecture mode Gintoki too. Wait, he really did just kick him off the roof. Oooh here comes Gin vs. Hijikata.Nice save, Yamazaki. [Damn.](http://i.imgur.com/fGZmF2i.png)

---
**Ep. 247** - Hijikata vs. Gin?[Nevermind.](http://i.imgur.com/ehBrBWt.png) The sadists downstairs are hilarious, I love her rallying back to Sougo. Also Yamazaki with... anpan, of course. Was waiting to see what Kondo would have in store for them, and [I was not disappointed.](http://i.imgur.com/wF9W0NO.png)

I like the final confrontation between Sougo and the girl (sorry, forget her name), but I kinda wish there was more to it. Maybe she'll come back one day?

Nice, it was a trap to trick the Mimawarigumi all along. [Model citizen Gintoki.](http://i.imgur.com/yCqTyxD.png) [Whaaaaaaat?!](http://i.imgur.com/RXY1goR.png) I guess Takasugi has to be behind most of the villains at one point or another. And assassin girl likes donuts! I like her. Not even Otae level, but I still like her.

And here comes sentimental ending time, as usual. I like the framed montage, but for once it's with the ED music rather than the OP.

---
**Ep. 248** - Madaodog Madaonaire? I don't like where this is going from the title alone. I hate seeing Hasegawa getting kicked while he's down. I do like the story structure for this one with him having flashbacks to find out the answers to the questions.

As the show frequently does, it subverts my expectations and turns it into a heartwarming episode. Hasegawa's done that before, like with Daigoro and his mom, but he never ends up benefitting from it himself which makes me sad. [This little girl.](http://i.imgur.com/wNLGMtR.png)I love the final question even though you know how it's obviously going to turn out, though I was kinda expecting Hasegawa to have to ask what her name is. I'm glad he already knew.

---
**Ep. 249** - [Hi Shinpachi!](http://i.imgur.com/dtLW11m.png) I didn't even realize him and Kagura were missing from the last arc.Gedoumarureturns! I was wondering if we were going to see her again, she's fun. Kindof a weird episode with shopping around for horrible things, but still fairly good. I like seeing Pandemonium-san return again and of course it still ends poorly for Shinpachi.

I didn't get a screenshot of it but I like Gin's backrub for Kagura after she vomits. It definitely wasn't necessary but it goes to show that he does care in little ways. [What.](http://i.imgur.com/yaEY3Ap.png) [What?](http://i.imgur.com/GnSECQr.png)

---
**Ep. 250** - New Year's envelope! Didn't know that was a thing. I like how Kagura only plays along with Gin for so long before throwing him into a wall. [Even Tama gets in on breaking the fourth wall.](http://i.imgur.com/vt3samK.png) Love all the metahumor there.

[Nice symbolism, Tsukuyo.](http://i.imgur.com/OWIXgfY.png) And her and Gin are fun to see arguing with each other, she does *not* put up with his shit (not like anyone does). [Nice try, Elizabeth.](http://i.imgur.com/1BPAXfs.png) And of course Kyubei just wants some balls.

Hasegawa's reality warping is just *weird*. I was confused the first time it happened but then caught on as the characters did.

---
Okay, took me a little over an hour start to finish. Thorny arc is pretty good, I like seeing Hijikata fight and we finally get some more of his history. Other episodes were kinda random but not bad. No idea if I'll even have anything topost next week and I definitely won't be responding to others then if I do.

I would say Bender is my spirit bot but I don't drink/smoke/steal enough.

> It's like you have a ranking system for Gintama alone or something

Pretty much. They're also divided into groups based on character frequency and complexity. Kagura's in a category of her own, but in the frequently recurring class Kyubei and Tsukuyo are at the top, and for infrequent/one-shots (where Nobume would actually go for now) Kirara and Ikumatsu are leading.

> Return soon, Durinthal. Have fun at PAX East!

Thanks! It'll be exhausting but fun.

Ikumatsu is the best. I don't usually ship characters but I ship her so hard with Katsura. [Just look at them!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/fd753b1dec7cbfdff7158cff4a788659/tumblr_mhx4wv2yb81rz7su3o1_1280.jpg)

Interesting that they'd show ~~Nobume~~ Mukoro in the prison scene. Nearly forgot about her ties to Oboro, however it was teased in the Courtesan of a Nation arc so its not like this came out of no where.

Hmmm i'm inclined to agree....but then again, there's that really really really controversial twist in the FS arc. We'll see how anime-only's take the revelation.

I think they are about equal in terms of quality. It also contains my favorite Gintama scene of all time, so it has that going for it.

When I first read this part of the arc in the manga, it really reminded me of how many damn deaths there are in Gintama. Just about every one is somehow significant to the arc it is a part of and it always feels as natural as a death can be. But that doesn't mean it's something I want! 

I loved the callback to Zenzo and Gintoki [meeting in the convenience store](http://i.imgur.com/FmmzV7q.jpg). Then there was the beautifully done closer for [Tokugawa Shigeshige](http://i.imgur.com/D91Ru8A.png).

That's probably the reference. They cherished the teachin'gs of Shoyo above all and clung to that. Gin, of course, clings to JUMP.

[](#elsieqq)

It's really odd to see Gintama go into full-on serious mode without knowing if the more comedic moments will ever be the focus again. It's almost unnerving. However, I think this is exactly what it was meant to feel like. Gin's final line reflects this, and how the status quo will never be the same. 

This series can't go back to what it was, and it knows that. Instead, Gintama is plunging head first into its darkest hours, likely with the intention to wrap things up. I'm excited to see how everything turns out, but I expect more tragedy to come.
>> ARTICLE
There are comedic moments after FS arc though
>> ARTICLE
Oh, good. Thanks for telling me.
>> ARTICLE
Perfect ending. 

"It's darkest before dawn. But don't close your eyes, because those that turn their eyes away from the darkness won't be able to see the light shining on them tomorrow." 

Looking forward to next week.

Moments like these are my favorite parts of storytelling, regardless of what end of the stick I'm on- the teller or the listener. It's the teller's opportunity to speak directly to their audience about whatever happens to be on their minds concerning the world around them, making the scale of that world and all sorts of social boundaries totally insignificant. This is the part that I always connect with the most, and it should be! From my perspective, the teller has toiled away at building an entire world *and* filling it with characters *and* making that world *and* those characters believable *and* relatable almost entirely for the purpose of reaching this moment (or in the case of long stories like this, these moments). These moments, these monologues (the shogun's monologue in this case) are in their own way, the climax of the story, the payoff. They easily have the ability to utterly transcend their own stories, becoming more than just another character's line.

Whenever moments like this happen (still talking about the shogun's monologue here) I always hear what the character is saying three times. I hear what the character is saying about their world, and what it implies about their future. I hear the storyteller making the story significantly more complex and rich. And finally I hear the storyteller directly speaking to their audience as they attempt to pass on their personal nugget of wisdom. 

There's always a lot of truth in that last part, but as ever, it is entirely up to the individual to interpret the storyteller's words. I for one, took it fairly literally; as the storyteller's way of prodding his audience to consider more seriously the implications of globalization and the spread of democracy and the like. Just take a moment to think about it. What do those two things *really* mean in the context of the larger scale; the world at large? You even have an example to work with if you can't quite imagine it. Really. I mean, you've been watching *Gintama* all this time right?

(Erm... the topic of samurai, by the way, I interpreted to be repetitions of the "find their own way and identity through life" lines, but from different perspectives. This really isn't a "growing up" type of story, so you're on your own for that one.)

man Gintama is just good quality shit, its just... good and that is all i have to say, cant wait for the next arc
>> ARTICLE
It's just painful to see Shigeshige die on Soyo's lap while the rest of the characters are reading Soyo's letter about how well things are going for them.

I'm just gonna watch all the Shogun episodes and cry (for reference  83, 151-152, 217, 237-238, 257, 260, 261, 283,284). All his moments were the best.

151-152! That one was hilarious I agree
>> ARTICLE
FUCK.ME.

Farewell Shigeshige, you will be missed... T_T
>> ARTICLE
Shigeshige's death  was spoiled for me in an earlier thread but i convinced myself they were talking about the double Zenzo killed.

The moment Sho-chan said he would go alone and they gave the assassin his close up shot i didn't want to believe it was going to happen.

poor Soyo T_T
>> ARTICLE
Same, I saw something titled the shogun assasination arc and I was like "damn, well thats ruined". Read through the manga and saw the plot twist where he was alive and I was like thank fuck. I wasn't prepared for that ending 
>> ARTICLE
How many times will they toy with our feelings? First you think he's going to die, and then he does! But it turns out to be his double and you heave a sigh of relief. But then he does die at the end by poisoning.
Moral of the story: Never let your guard down when it comes to the fate of a character.
>> ARTICLE
No words, just tears ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Damn that ending was depressing yet beautiful at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
RIP Sho-chan. this is the anime's best arc so far. let's see how they handle the next arc.
>> ARTICLE
Today is my birthday, wanted to watch Gintama for laughs, not feelings.
>> ARTICLE
Happy BDay :)
>> ARTICLE
I'm at loss for words. Did that really just happen? Holy FUCK
>> ARTICLE
We killed sho-chan once, but wouldn't it be fun to kill him again??;_;
>> ARTICLE
I'm confused about what happened at the end. Did he get poisoned and went back to his room to see his sister?
>> ARTICLE
Yes he got poisoned and asked to spend his last moments as Soyo's brother instead of the Shogun.

It ties perfectly to the first scene of this arc, when he wished to shared a cup of his sisters horrible tea without his title.
>> ARTICLE
Yes,he wanted to be with her little sister till the end and die as tokugawa shigeshige.
>> ARTICLE
Remember, having an issue of Shonen Jump can potentially save your life, especially in a *bizarre* series such as Gintama or other things.
>> ARTICLE
Was it just me that was scared that Soyo would be assassinated by a fake Shigeshige in that last scene?

It didn't happen and what we got was Shigeshige dying peacefully ;~;

People weren't kidding when they say that this arc is the point of no return. You have to wonder how a Nobunobu-led Edo would look like. I mean we get to have a preview of that with the Mimawarigumi in the next ep

Damn, this arc was a hell of a ride

Backstories of a lot of characters (including two of the biggest - Gintoki and Takasugi), action, atmosphere, intensity (Takasugi pounding Gintoki on the ground), suspense and of course the feels

If there were any doubts on Gorilla-author's writing, it would be pretty much gone by now

Before Courtesan of a Nation was IMO the best arc but this arc really delivered and IMO deserves to be called the best arc in Gintama currently

10/10 easily
>> ARTICLE
This is it, the point of no return. The Gintama rollercoaster has reached its apex, and it's not slowing down. This changes things. 

The Farewell, Shinsengumi arc is the greatest Gintama arc to date. I'm hyped and sad at the same time. This arc gives you the full range of emotions. [Prerequisite arcs are Thorny, Courtesan of a Nation, Soul Reaper and Shogun Assassination. ]

It is implied in this episode [and later confirmed](/s "that Nobume is Shoyou's last disciple.")
Sweet dreams, Sho-chan.

PS: The Matsuri is scheduled for March 6. 
>> ARTICLE
I must admit, i did have a little smirk on my face when anime-only's actually thought everyone would get out of this arc alive :D

Btw did anyone else have the exact same reaction to the assassin as me? Literally as soon as i saw him, i started to repeat "ShigeShige's dead...done...finished" in quick succession until his obvious demise. 

Those sneaky animators at BNP had already decided to do the FS arc ages ago too. Realized when i saw this [promotional image](http://cdn2.natalie.mu/media/comic/1511/1103/extra/news_header_gintama_ansatsu.jpg)  that didn't seem to fit perfectly with the SA arc...that's because the left side represents the FS arc and the right side represents the SA arc.

But yeh enough of the joking aha This was pretty damn sad, even though i had already seen this in manga form. Beautifully done episode and the directing like last episode was on point. Especially the Shoyou jail scene which i absolutely adored and of course ShigeShige's death.

Can't wait to drown in my tears when i see my favorite Gintama scene of all time in the upcoming FS arc....:(

I thought that Zenzo was the one who was going to die but it turned out to be the Shogun.

The new Gintama symbol for the FS arc is blue instead of red now http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/gintama/index2.html

>> ARTICLE
yeh i'm aware. I meant the fact they placed the Shinsengumi on the left and Takasugi on the right. It didn't make sense initially, because you'd think they put maybe Kamui, Kagura, Shogun or someone else. But now it's obvious it was meant to imply the FS arc as well. That's why they've reused the promotional image for the FS arc, because it was interchangeable. 
>> ARTICLE
> Btw did anyone else have the exact same reaction to the assassin as me?

Yeah, as soon as they shook hands I was like "oh fuck here it comes". I was expecting it to be way more blatant though, like straight up stabbed in the gut or something. So for a moment they actually succeeded in getting me to breathe a sigh of relief.

I had a feeling something was gonna happen regardless because of all the people's looks at the end of The Courtesan of a Nation arc.

More like most of this season.. Seriously ever since they changed Studio the animation and art has been inconsistent for me. The best parts are really really good and better than any other season but then you get episodes full of QUALITY(in a bad way).

>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling Shigeshige might return.I'm saying this because we saw Shoyo in prison and Oboro said "You defied the Heavens and got brought back to earth." which probably means he died and somehow came back. I don't know maybe Shigeshige will come back too? Maybe that short scene could of been a hint of some sort? I'm saying this to bring some hope to us non-manga readers. 
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to burst your bubble, dude, but he probably means along the lines of "flew too close to the sun." Don't worry, I'll cry with you. 
>> ARTICLE
Usually these big, serious arcs are self-contained, but finally this one managed to be relevant in the overall scheme of things. I'm definitely gonna miss Sho-chan; what a man! I'm curious as to what Zura's reaction to his death is gonna be... his entire life was fought against the Shogunate and he wasn't featured here at all. 

The animation was a bit iffy in certain scenes and I get the feeling that they burned through the budget animating the Gin- Takasugi fight.. And why, oh why did they have to play the retarded OP song when Shigeshige lay dying? They just fucking killed the mood. Silence was all that was required.
>> ARTICLE
> he wasn't featured here at all.

He was on standby.
>> ARTICLE
> And why, oh why did they have to play the retarded OP song when Shigeshige lay dying? They just fucking killed the mood. Silence was all that was required.

I like the song, but I agree with you. Extending that scene for almost two minutes and overlaying that song was definitely a bad directing choice.

Other than that, excellent episode, excellent arc. My biggest fear was that they would ruin both the Gintoki/Takasugi fight and Shoyou's execution somehow but they delivered those perfectly. Anything else, I can forgive.
>> ARTICLE
It took me five minutes, but I removed the audio, put it into Audacity, silenced the outro track and remuxed the audio back in. It's way better now.

Would you share?

I was really dreading this episode, being also a manga reader, but dang they did it sooooo good! Plus, for me at least, the manga was a little confusing. I wasn't really sure if Shigeshige was really dead in the last scene with Soyo. It was so clear in the anime, and done so beautifully I must say. That last scene with the two of them and the sunset, framed by the shoji doors...breathtaking! And I did like the ED here. It does fit if you know the words. "Not wanting it to end, we've kept on and on; surely we always knew-now is the time to make a change." Sad change, but necessary for the story to continue. Bravo Gorilla Sensei.

First of all I don't think I'll be able to keep up with these discussions anytime soon, 6 episodes is just a bit too much.

But anyways , turns out I actually skipped some of these episodes on my first watch so this week was kind of refreshing.

**Ep13:**
 good episode overall but nothing truly outstanding.

**Ep 14:**
Great episode  to be honest

-Part 1 was great, i love just how much respect the shinsengumi has for kondo san. I really appreciate it when the characters in this show act like actual people instead of just being walking joke machines.

-part 2 was also quite nice, though it's kinda weird that it took about 240 episodes for the princess to be relevant again.

**Ep 15:**
decent episode, i love elizabeth but this episode didn't have anything funny or interesting in particular, though the new ED is sweet.

**Ep16:**
Daaaw poor Hasegawa, his episodes always make me feel sad. Him doing what's right always leads him further into the Madao way of life.

**Ep 17:**
Finally the main antagonist makes an appearance, though i never really found him as an interesting character until the later episodes.
That being said i really liked this episode, it was a nice combination of character introductions, comedy and serious moments.

**Ep18:**
What's up with Yamazaki?, i don't think i ever noticed his weird gags until now.
Anyways I think this has been the first episode that has truly made me laugh, though it's still not nearly as good as the later ones.

**Outstanding moments this week:**

* Kaptain katsura and the One Park

* Shinsengumi in their summer Uniforms

* Sougo & Kagura at the festival

* Kagura's G- string

* "Anywhere within the reach of my sword is my country" I love most of what Gintoki says but this Quote in particular is great.

I think the show is finally beginning to improve in quality, I'm quite excited since to me ep 25 was the turning point in this show.
>> ARTICLE
> Kaptain katsura and the One Park

Also: "Zura ja nai. Captain Katsura dattebayo!"
>> ARTICLE
Yea this show is definitely getting better. Some of the first 10 episodes weren't good at all whereas this set of 6 had at least a couple of redeemable parts each. Then ep 18 was dumb fun the whole way through.

**My Outstanding moments this week:**

* Gintoki's goofy sounds while making a badass pirate style rescue

* The moment I realised Katsura is sauntering around telling everyone his name despite being a wanted terrorist

* Sougo & Kagura at the festival

* The ending of the festival and the epilogue

* Kagura's G- string and her Bruce Lee suit

* The underwear thief was more of an underwear shinobi. How can that kind of joke character turn out to be so cool?
>> ARTICLE
I made it!

I remember 15 being the first episode that made me laugh hard (the end where they were stacking) and 18 being the episode that cemented me into continuing the anime that would soon become my favourite, so this is a great batch. 

Having marathoned Gintama through July of last year, this is like a first anniversary for me. Perfect time to rewatch. Also, [Zura's character](/s "there goes Zura's last serious moments. From the time he gets Elizabeth on, he only gets crazier and crazier.")

Having lurked around /r/anime for a while and seeing the praise this show has gotten, it seemed like a good idea to catch up to this group and participate. The enthusiasm around it is encouraging to say the least, though the first few batches of episodes felt inconsistent to me in regard to personal entertainment. I find myself enjoying episodes like #18 that are light on plot and heavy on antics, though that isnt to say that I wont be looking forward to the serious substance that the show can offer down the road. However, some of the character-centric episodes like 15 and 16 just didnt grab me. That isnt to say that they were flat. I havent gone one episode without a handful of laughs, and with each subsequent episode it feels as though the show is reaching its stride as it fleshes its cast out. The level of self-awareness in its lack of direction is refreshing, and things like that will have me coming back to the show every day. That, and faces like [this](http://i.imgur.com/knEp60I.jpg?1).
>> ARTICLE
The first episodes of Gintama are known to be mediocre. Not good, but not bad either, just *meh*. This will change soon, most people pinpoint episode 25 as the turning point when the show evolve from "making you chuckle" to "making you have to pause the video so you can catch your breath again from laughing so hard"
>> ARTICLE
I just watched episode 25 (first time viewer). This was really the best/funniest one thus far! The first 20 or so were reeeaallly slow and dare I say it, even annoying. After that though it seems to find a good rythm. I can only hope that all the praise is justified since there are about 250 more episodes left to watch :D
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean, the humor in these early episodes can be really annoying. I just watched episode 11 and 18 again and the humor is really weird, almost nothing like it is in later episodes. In episode 11 there was a scene where Otose gets mad and for a quick shot turns into a robot and fires a headbeam at the Yorozuya. This kind of joke is completely outside of what I'd expect from Gintama and falls more into the standard shonen humor category.
>> ARTICLE
> with each subsequent episode it feels as though the show is reaching its stride 

You basically nailed it. It only gets better from here :'D
>> ARTICLE
Trust me it gets way better soon. Just wait until the staff starts making jokes about having their time slot moved, or their budget run out, or anything like that. 

These episodes, the first 20-30, really just lay the groundwork for the rest of the series to be great. They introduce a ton of characters that they use later to great effect. 
>> ARTICLE
That robot scene :(
>> ARTICLE
A nice batch of episodes this week.  
We got to see:   
Elizabeth's and Madao's introduction and the relationship between the main three of the Shinsengumi.  
>> ARTICLE
Ep 13  Man, I remember when I first started learning Japanese (a couple years after watching this episode), and I knew how to count to three from Gintokis random school festival rant.
    I love how they forced Gintoki into carrying them home.

Ep 14  You know, for an episodic anime, things often do tie together.  Also, Id totally watch a Gintama cooking show   Plus, yay Mr. Raindrop!

Ep 15  Id completely forgotten where Elizabeth came from.  And I love this episode.

Ep 16  Aw, poor Madao.  Also, that customer at Otoses, Mu-san, cracks me up.

Ep 17  Oh, its Takasugi.  That that mean its time for Benizakura?

Ep 18  only Gintama would have an entire episode about an underwear thief.  Where the reaction is to plant landmines everywhere.  Ahhh.

It's getting more and more serious. We can expect a huge war with the Amanto.
