Anbiribabruya!!

>> ARTICLE
Holy shit! They actualy mix up l's and r's.

Ansatsu Kyoushitsu actually wasn't making this up.


>> ARTICLE
As far as I can tell, it's not so much that they mix them up as they just have the same sound for both, so to people who *can* distinguish between the two letters, it always sounds like the wrong one.
>> ARTICLE
ok.
>> ARTICLE
Thats the best thing I've seen today.
>> ARTICLE
the most Anbiribabruya thing you have seen.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, god, I hate Engrish
>> ARTICLE
Wel at least this is not a character from UK/USA who speaks Engrish.

This is just a Japanese boy who can't speak English :P
>> ARTICLE
Funniest shit is Japanese horribly breaking language. 

Russian gets butchered alot.  And the rarest one I think I have ever seen was butchering of Somali of all things.

It's why for international themed stuff, I prefer dubs.  Evidently funimation has an easier time finding voice actors that are better at languages and finding a native speaker to coach then for some really esoteric shit like Urdu or Bantu.
>> ARTICLE
Ah. You reminded me of Zankyou no Terror. It came so close to being amazing all the way through. Then...

Is it supposed to be "unbelievable"?

Yeah

That's some A+ Engrish right there.

Dude, NSFW that. 
>> ARTICLE
Slam Dunk is one of my favourite manga but I never hear it mentioned on here (because it's from pre-2000). Great to see some support for it on here.
>> ARTICLE
Watched the anime a few weeks ago and its amazing. And i dont even like basketball :o yet I enjoyed the anime so much. Would u recomend reading the manga from the begining or can i continue where the anime left off?  
>> ARTICLE
Bought the first volume of the manga for Japanese reading practice so hopefully I'll be able to read it soon!
>> ARTICLE
Same here.  It sucks the anime stopped,  i wished there was a continuation. Btw,  what were your feelings on the ending?  I actually felt hollow inside after the ending,  great way to end it 
>> ARTICLE
I think the hype and everything in the last 2 chapters or so of the manga (been like a decade since I read it) were some of the best, all action, no dialogue. They were able to slow time down and put me in the moment of those last few seconds and feel emotions all the way to the end. Very few manga or comics have had that effect on me, but I'll always remember the feels when I read them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I recently read it last year and damn did I almost shed tears during the match. My favorite moment would be when [Slam Dunk] (/s "Skauragi proclaimed his love for basketball when he broke his spine (i think it was or was it back??)")
>> ARTICLE
so true, that moment was a big full circle moment =x 
>> ARTICLE
The only issue that I have with the manga ending is that the author spends many chapters building up these potential rival character and not use them in the end. 
>> ARTICLE
The final arc of the story was super tense, I thought it was a great ending
>> ARTICLE
Not the guy you asked but the entire final arc was absolutely hype af and had me tearing up. I didn't really care for the way they ended Sakuragi's character but I thought the overall ending was great and fairly realistic, I didn't feel very unsatisfied.
>> ARTICLE
Are you guys talking about the anime or the manga? If the anime has it's own original ending but it's still good, I'll give it a chance. If the ending is lame though and I'm better off reading the manga after episode 96, then I'll just stick with the manga all the way through.
>> ARTICLE
I'm talking about the manga's ending arc, i'm not sure how the anime's ending arc goes though hopefully someone else can answer that for you
>> ARTICLE
Go with the manga all the way through. The manga's amazing. The anime is pretty bad (I won't blame them, it was made in the 90s, they didn't capture the dynamic of basketball like for example Kuroko no Basuke does, although KnB (as a manga, and regarding the story, characters, unrealism, etc.) clearly isn't as good as Slam Dunk (but has a way better adaptation as I said, since it's more recent, though to begin with the manga is not as good as Slam Dunk to me) ).
>> ARTICLE
manga it is then.
>> ARTICLE
Anime ending is really lame. You can't really call it an ending tbh . You'd expect there to be more, but it just ends. only positive side is that there is a extra game which is quite fun, but that's just it. The last 8-9 volumes weren't adapted

I would still say that the anime is worth it, but maybe that's because I am a fanboy.

It has some pacing issues (it's Toei, what do you expect?), so maybe you are better off just reading the manga, idk it's your choice

No Gorilla cosplay?! 0 out of 10!

Read the manga than the anime. The art and scenes during the final chapters of the manga really make it worth the read.
>> ARTICLE
you'll enjoy it, it's very good. 
>> ARTICLE
READ it! I repeat, don't WATCH it, READ it. It's one of my favorite mangas, and I don't read a lot of mangas at all, but the anime is pretty terrible compared to the manga (and I'm generally an anime guy anyway!). It doesn't feel dynamic at all, when the ball hits the ground it makes the sound effect of a rock hitting the ground, the characters on the court during the match often make weird back-and-forth stoic movements (it's the 90s I know but it's still bad). Honestly, it's not worth it, and way too many episodes for nothing since it doesn't even go to ... like... half the manga if I remember? If it was made today, it would need the same dynamism as Kuroko no Basuke, which is really good at depicting the dynamism in basketball (but the story is ridiculous and the show gets pretty bad, Slam Dunk is way better as a Basketball manga, as it's realistic!...well, except for the fact that they're all high schooler who are all over 1m80 or something lol).

Seriously, the manga is super super super good! (and you can clearly see the author get better at drawing. Comparing the drawings in the early volumes and in the later ones is really interesting! He became way better!)
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Do it! I only watched it last year, aged pretty well compared to many other shows 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished it. Just remember that episode 96 (97-101 is just a way for them to end the anime)is the last episode that is part of the manga. From then you will need to read the manga which is just as good coming from someone who doesn't read a lot of manga.


>> ARTICLE
I watched the anime, but I have no idea where to start the manga. Any clue where to start?
>> ARTICLE
I'd say around 185 if you want to continue from the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I think the Manga is loads and loads better then the anime. I'm not one of those people who always says that either, I just think Slam Dunk works better when you read it.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! I don't read a lot of mangas, and most of the time I prefer the anime (for Death Note and stuff I STILL say the anime is better for incredible sound effects, Red/Blue colors chosen, etc.). However, for Slam Dunk, the anime is pretty bad (well, it's 1990 so I can't blame them but it doesn't feel dynamic at all and is overal...pretty terrible). The manga however is one of my favorites!
>> ARTICLE
Slam Dunk > Kuroko.  Fight me.

I am with you, Slam Dunk is hundred times better than Kuroko.

I actually will, prepare to catch them hands, will be at your door in 4 hours tracking your IP address as you speak.

>> ARTICLE
Personally, I don't like Kuroko. Well, not anymore anyways. 

At the beginning they all seemed really interesting, with the misdirection and Tora's jumping power, it still sticked to the realistic side of things, like **it can be done**. 

But soon it tried to turn itself into a power-up gimmick like most shounen, where they gain powerups and they have special **names** for their special **moves**. (Fucking "The Zone". I think I stopped somewhere along the introduction of that)

Maybe it's because I grew up with Slam Dunk, but it felt really really bad to watch if you think of it from a realistic POV.
>> ARTICLE
I feel exactly the same way, I was furious when zones were introduced and games becomes one on one fights and teammates don't matter. Not even rukawa, as broken as he is, got to the point where he needs zero assistance from his teammates.
>> ARTICLE
Teamates always mattered...
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly what I told my friend. I think I got half way through the first season and stopped because of this. It   just started making up shit for basketball moves. My friend told me it gets even worse later on. I can't even imagine. 

Haikyuu is so much more enjoyable to me. Everything is within the realm of possibility, and they even emphasize how difficult and ridiculous they are able to pull off some of that moves. Not to mention the characters are actually interesting and enjoyable to watch. Sorta the same feeling I get from Slam Dunk. I never felt engaged with any of Kuroko's characters. 

It may also be because I know more about basketball so a lot of these moves just seem arbitrary and have very little to do with basketball itself (I just can't accept the whole "presence disappearance" as a concept, and that's just the tip of the iceberg). I found myself enjoying Prince of Tennis more, and I'm not really sure why since it's almost just as ridiculous. I think they still have some association with real tennis moves so I can sorta accept it lol. 
>> ARTICLE
> I just can't accept the whole "presence disappearance" as a concept, and that's just the tip of the iceberg

It wasn't the "presence disappearance" that attracted me, but rather it was "Misdirection" that attracted me, not only because it's a real skill that's mostly used by magicians or those who've mastered the sleight of hand, but also because it seemed like it's somehow doable in a real game
>> ARTICLE
>Presence disappearance

I would've liked it if kuroko were a football/soccer(for americans) and Kuroko were this Iniesta-like player. He would be the one who makes the pass to the one who makes the assist to the one who scores the goal, and it would be more realistic than what we can see with Kuroko and basket.
>> ARTICLE
The full court shot and catch the ball midair jumper just killed me.  
>> ARTICLE
An the fact that all the mid-air jumpers were 3 pointers is just bullshit
>> ARTICLE
You would love Prince of Tennis /s
>> ARTICLE
Tezuka Zone~~!!
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, New Prince of Tennis is just impossible to take seriously, literally all techniques are bullshit and they're still in middle school
>> ARTICLE
You think thats bullshit? Look at the timeline for the entire first manga/anime. All that shit happens in, like, three months time. Seriously, it's one season, apparently. I read that and was like "wat?"
>> ARTICLE
I think that in all of PoT, the episodes I enjoyed the most are the Inui Juice challenges
>> ARTICLE
Slam dunk is a sports shounen. Kuroko is a battle shounen. No comparison hahah
>> ARTICLE
It's not even close. We really need a Slam Dunk remake.
>> ARTICLE
Why would I fight you for being right though?
>> ARTICLE
Slam Dunk the best basket ball anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Basketball and anime are my two favorite things in the world, yet there isn't a basketball anime out there that I can stand... oh well.
>> ARTICLE
ever tried mixing ice cream with ketchup?
>> ARTICLE
I kinda understand what you mean. When you know a subject intimately you can't really watch anime of it without thinking how it can lack realism or has big flaws that almost annoy you (Shintar Midorima's 100% shooting springs to mind). Pushing that aside I still ended up loving Slam Dunk and enjoyed Kuroko's Basketball. Slam Dunk is probably the funniest anime I have ever watched. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched Slam Dunk?
>> ARTICLE
Tried it awhile ago.
>> ARTICLE
And you... didn't like it? I'm baffled.

What did you not like about it specifically, if you don't mind me asking?
>> ARTICLE
The slow pace and dialogue (I guess I find myself wanting something realistic when it comes to how the characters interact in a game in basketball anime). As an example of this in sports anime, I absolutely loved Ping Pong The Animation.
>> ARTICLE
See, the slow pace and dialogue is actually the best parts of the show for many.

Did you want him to just be a basketball genius (like he brags) and get it all right from the start?

It is a realistic take on a delinquent reforming himself through sports.

The dialogue is also really authentic throughout.
>> ARTICLE
Are there any other ones besides Kuroko's Basketball? 
>> ARTICLE
Dude Ro Kyu Bu. Best basketball anime ever!!!
>> ARTICLE
There is one, can't remember the title. It takes place in thr future and they play on raised court. The MC is a small person with blue hair that can dunk.  I think it even got a live action adaptation. I think they also had aliens lol.
>> ARTICLE
That's Buzzer Beater which is also by Takehiko Inoue. He's got a serious thing for Basketball since he also makes Real which is a manga about wheelchair bound people that play. BB isn't nearly as good though imo. It's fun, but it's rife with cliche's and shonen cheese that made my eyes roll too hard and too often.
>> ARTICLE
Real is fantastic!!!! 
>> ARTICLE
There's also Dear Boys, I quite liked it but not sure how well it has aged.

basquash

Those are really good 

I wish we would get some kind of remake including the rest of the manga that wasn't adapted

Never seen the show but this is awesome cosplay. A wide variety of characters and each of them match their character in costume, facial expression and demeanor. So much better than all the cosplay of pretty girls with dead eyes and the same blank facial expression every photo that normally gets upvoted here.

I'm in agreement here. Anyone else remember that ridiculous gundam throwback in the beginning. The references and meta jokes just keep on coming after that.

The first skit, no less. Most comedies warm up steadily but Nichibros comes sprinting right out of the gate.

Literary Girl...by far the hardest I've laughed from any anime
>> ARTICLE
The best love story ever.

Baka to test to shoukanjuu, nothing can be compared to that
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! Both the dub and the sub were hilarious, though the Ghost Stories dub gets a close second place.
>> ARTICLE
This to me is the benchmark of comedy. I have yet to watch an anime that has made me consistently laugh through every episode such as Baka
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even realize Baka was a comedy the first time I watched it. What the h...I want to laugh too. 
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree, I'm actually on the last episode of season 1 right now and this show has consistently made me laugh pretty hard, especially that geass reference earlier on. I think the only thing that has come close so far, is actually another show I'm in the middle of -  English dubbed Ghost Stories. This definitely requires a certain type of humor though, but it's making me literally laugh out loud.

Same here, have been looking for something of a similar caliber ever since I finished, and it will always have a special place in ky heart. Still waiting for the third season (I know that we're never seeing it).

Hatarou-Maou Sama, that show was my personal favourite comedy so far and plastic nee san comes a very short second to it.

SYD! The crude humor got me like crazy and the rapid fire nature of the jokes had me laughing out loud and consistently.

My favorite parts has to be "Takatoshi and Squid" and everytime Mitsuba comes on as the Judo girl with Maka from Soul Eater's voice. She doesn't have to say anything funny, her voice is just so damn funny.

Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu!

That one really hit the nail on the head with it's humor.

This was the first comedy series I watched, and it was glorious. I haven't seen a series that could made me laugh straight through a whole episode, except for this one.

Plastic nee-san

Most anime may get a sensible chuckle but this one made me laugh.

I actually have to pause a couple of times due to me losing focus from laughing so hard. Also, shoutout to Senjougahara-sama for doing the voice of Beautiful Person. X)

Binbougami Ga!

I can't even describe the laugh i was having when i saw that Death Note parody. This was the first time in an anime that made me laughing like a pig. Not just that of course every episode is a anti-cliche parody.

That's the one scene I show to everyone to get them to watch the show.

Outbreak company- to watch this you should have background in anime (this shouldn't be your first anime) It's all about the otaku culture, it's really fucking funny. Plastic nee-san also made me laugh. Both of these will make you laugh, not just chuckle.

[Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2605/Sayonara_Zetsubou_Sensei). This dark, sarcastic, absurd, ridiculous humor caught me off guard, I was watching entire series with tears of joy. Though I understand that the anime is not everyone's cup of tea.

[Arakawa Under the Bridge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7647/Arakawa_Under_the_Bridge) is a close second place, and I see it as a more light-hearted version of SZS (humor is pretty much similar in both). 
>> ARTICLE
SZS is hilarious, my favourite moment has to be when Nozomu talks about casual talk or the chain of stalkers.
>> ARTICLE
Regarding SZS, apparently the author told SHAFT how the series is supposed to end. This explains the bizzare  openings for the series. I just read the final chapters of SZS and oh man it gets dark.

Welcome to thr NHK makes me more depressed than happy
>> ARTICLE
Really? As someone who has issues with some similar things, I think it helps me to be able to see the humor in some of the illogical reasoning Sato uses. I also love the lack of any true antagonist, and that each character has their own problems and feels like a person.

IDK maybe it's just because I can relate to Sato. Episode 13 very nearly made me cry. It was kinda stupid,  but again, as someone who has similar issues it felt pretty emotional to me.
>> ARTICLE
Cromartie High School is more or less the funniest shit in anime history. That, Golden Boy, and GTO form a sort of classic comedy triumverate.

Girls Bravo is a hysterical parody of the harem genre. Every trope is taken up to eleven. Main character gets punished for accidental perviness with suplexes and extended slapstick routines (which has traumatized him to the point that he's allergic to women). the creepy stalker character literally summons demons to aid in her conquests. And then there's Fukuyama, the richest, perviest "rich, pervy rival" character in anime history. It's good times.

Also, ranma 1/2, the only place where those tropes were actually funny at face value, is pretty great except for the entirety of the fourth and fifth seasons.

Welcome to the NHK doesn't have the most laughs, but it has some of the deepest and darkest.

pet girl of sakurasou had me in stitches.

Midori days is pretty damn amazing. also has the best bloopers.

and as far as short anime go, Senyu is just the funniest.

The top 3 funniest shows I've seen are [Seto no Hanayome](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2104/Seto_no_Hanayome), [D-Frag!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20031/D-Frag!) and [NouCome](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19221/Ore_no_Nounai_Sentakushi_ga_Gakuen_Love_Comedy_wo_Zenryoku_de_Jama_Shiteiru). The first 2 episodes of Seto no Hanayome among some of the funniest things I've ever seen.

Despite not being a full fledged comedy like the shows mentioned above, [Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time) had a [couple of moments which left me in tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTzoMGAN8JE), no spoilers involved.

Honorable mentions to [Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8841/Kore_wa_Zombie_Desu_ka) and [Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10456/Kyoukaisenjou_no_Horizon) as well.

Ben-to, wow what a great anime, i never watch stuff like that and just by a coincidence i started watching it and it was hilarious. The way they took so serious such a dumb premise couldn't be better
>> ARTICLE
Binbougami ga! and Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu are the two funniest animes I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi. The first half of that series when it was straight up slapstick/paraody made me laugh so hard I thought I was gonna throw up. 
>> ARTICLE
Nothing compares to Baka to test for me

Runners ups would be School Rumble and Hataraku Maou-sama
>> ARTICLE
Trigun - Mainly the first few episodes. Rarely does an English dub make me "lol", but there was plenty during the course of this show. 


>> ARTICLE
Slam Dunk and GTO as well.
>> ARTICLE
Seitokai Yakuindomo - how come noone posted it yet O.o
>> ARTICLE
Im on episode 21 of GTO right now, one of those shows where the outdated animation doesnt even matter because it's funny as fuck

Daily lives of highschool boys is pure gold.
Yakitate Japan! was pretty funny.
Golden boy was more inspirational for me than funny somehow.

>> ARTICLE
Plastic Nee-san and Nichijou for me. Always. Yuuko's freakout at the coffee shop from Episode 16 will always be hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
Recent: Senyuu and D-Frag.
Older: Sexy Commando and FMP:Fumoffu
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari, i have never seen series that have made me laugh so much
>> ARTICLE
Nisemonogatari. The writing and direction had me laughing every episode.
>> ARTICLE
Plastic Nee-san, Nichijou, and more recently Joshiraku did it the most for me.
I haven't finished Joshiraku yet, so that one's quickly rising up the ladder for most funny.
>> ARTICLE
Joshiraku is amazing. The only thing that doesn't always work is that they do a lot of references to Japanese things and places.
>> ARTICLE
I doubt many will agree with me here, but Lucky Star has added millenniums to my lifetime. I still go back and watch my favorite scenes; it's so funny. Also, you should have a pretty good knowledge of anime or else you'll miss a lot of great references and parodies. Konata FTW! 
>> ARTICLE
Hataraku Maou-Sama is probably one of the funniest, heart-warming stories I have seen in awhile.
>> ARTICLE
Haiyore! Nyaruko San, and Hagani are my two favorite comedy anime. Both made me laugh multiple times each episode. 

*Cyclone!*
>> ARTICLE
Gintama, not only out of all anime I've seen, but out of all TV series and films I've seen as well. 

One of the most hilarious episodes for me was [episode 152](http://www.crunchyroll.com/gintama/episode-152-the-heavens-created-chonmage-above-man-instead-of-another-man-524632), the scene were [] (/s "Gintoki desperately pulls the Shogun's hair in an attempt to try to fix it back to how it used to be made me laugh so hard because of the facial expression the Shogun made.") I watched the episode during the night so I tried resisting laughing out loud, but I failed multiple times, I don't think I've ever laughed so hard and for so long in my life. 
>> ARTICLE
Slayers and it's sequels had me literally ROFLing.
>> ARTICLE
Came here to say Haganai and its sequel Haganai NEXT, which is even stronger.
>> ARTICLE
From the preview I wasn't expecting as much rape or gay robot sex from the series.
>> ARTICLE
Carnival Phantasm

Chobits comes to a close second
>> ARTICLE
Ouran High school Host Club! Ahhh I'll go re-watch that now.
>> ARTICLE
Kimi ni Todoke made me laugh the hardest even though its not particularly funny... I think One Piece has made me laugh the most though just because of the amount of eps...
>> ARTICLE
I think that some of those laughs were reflexive. At least for me, they were there to shock me out of my tears and give me some significant emotional swings from sobbing in shock to laughing my ass off and Pin paused mid-inanity in 30 seconds flat.
>> ARTICLE
Ouran highschool host club for me
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou, I don't think I've laughed so much watching an anime. The randomness was too much for my laugh box.

One Piece was packed to the brim with comedy, which was unexpected to me. I found myself laughing through entire episodes at a time. 
>> ARTICLE
Luffy is just hilarious.  
>> ARTICLE
I think my favorite moment of his would have to be on Thriller Bark when he [pushes a zombie who has emerged from his grave back down into it](http://youtu.be/OXX--SaCfq8)
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching Thriller bark. I didn't notice that part. For me the funniest part was when Luffy tries to train the three faced fox. Also, the armored Luffy was pretty hilarious too. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh man you had to have seen it. Thriller Bark is probably the most comedic of all the arcs if I had to say. The end of Usopp v Perona was also one of the funniest fucking things I've seen. God damn Oda is gifted with making up plotlines. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, it is the funniest arc I've seen so far. I laughed my ass off watching that video. Thanks for sharing.

>> ARTICLE
beelzebub made me laugh a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Really gonna have to be Seto no Hanayome for me. The endless slapstick comedy and whacky characters never made a boring moment for me.
>> ARTICLE
This season ''Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou'' is really funny.

''Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to The Animation'' is also great, but it's more pervy, really ecchi and the episodes are only 11mins long, but it's really funny.

Daily lives of High School Boys and Cromartie Highschool

on DLoHSB I literally dropped of my chair, still laughing :D
>> ARTICLE
The one show that has pretty much sent me into several uncontrolled fits of laughter would be Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashia/Humanity has Declined, though it's not really a 'typical' comedy.

Nichijou is also well-executed, though it can take a few episodes for one to really get into it.
>> ARTICLE
Golden Boy
>> ARTICLE
No one can forget about Full Metal Panic Fumoffu !
>> ARTICLE
This is a weird one. I got some strange fansubs (with swearing!) for Kampfer and it resulted in me being in a constant state of laughter.

More recently though Nisekoi has a habit of bringing out the laughs. Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to is also a constant hoot.
>> ARTICLE
Cromartie was pretty funny.
FMP fumoffu was my first comedy anime and was funny too
GTO was hilarious when it got weird
Gurren lagann episode 6... seriously Laughed so hard..
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to choose, so I'll list several, in no particular order:

* **Teekyuu**: the fastest one

* **Cromartie High School**: a sweet spot of bizarreness and hilarity

* **Seto no Hanayome**: lots of great random humour

* **Plastic Nee-san**: this show is [pure *wat*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6A2WhUcNec)
>> ARTICLE
The ones that made me laugh most were either [Hataraku Maou-sama!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama!) or [Chuunibyou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14741/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai!). Hower I'm currently watching Steins; Gate and Okabe... hrmm HOUOUIN KYOUMA always puts a smile on my face
>> ARTICLE
For me it was defiantly Bobobo, that shits gotta be my favorite comedy to date.
>> ARTICLE
Seto no Hanayome. I just can't stop rewatching it and laughing.
>> ARTICLE
After this episode 15? Nisekoi for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Baka to Test.  That entire class his hilarious
>> ARTICLE
School rumble
>> ARTICLE
Plastic Nee-San

>> ARTICLE
Other than Baka and Test and Binbougami ga, i'd have to say Oh! Edo Rocket.
>> ARTICLE
Probably Watamote. I can relate to that anime so well and its legit funny.
>> ARTICLE
Probably Angel Beats, the scene with the chairs flying xd
>> ARTICLE
The first half of steins gate made me grin from side to side while watching it.

Then the second half made me cry , a lot.

Cowboy bebop had a few funny episodes , i liked mushroom samba a lot 
Ed is funny dude
>> ARTICLE
kampfer here
>> ARTICLE
School Rumble - One of the first anime I ever watched from beginning to end and god damn what an anime it was
>> ARTICLE
Nichiboys and nichijou, can't do better than those.
>> ARTICLE
Baka Test
>> ARTICLE
Baka to Test and Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched a lot of comedies, but the only series that has managed to make me laugh every episode was Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, very funny, but also very sad. I didn't count how many times I have cried watching this.

Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-Chan is also very funny, but this is braindead ecchi humour with no plot and only wants to make you laugh (which it succeeds in).
>> ARTICLE
Baka to test is by far the funniest anime I have watched. Some scenes are depicted really retardedly you have to laugh. 
>> ARTICLE
Detroit Metal City. He asked for a single one, and DMC made me laugh the most.
>> ARTICLE
Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Toradora had a bunch of great moments too. 
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou
>> ARTICLE
I unfortunately have not seen Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, or Nichijou yet, so I can't comment on those.

Joshiraku is the most recent comedic anime I watched, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would say aspects of Kill la Kill were pretty humorous too (all of Mako's speeches).

I've seen lots of amazing GIFs of Plastic nee-san, so once I find a sub I'll probably end up watching that.
>> ARTICLE
GTO, Yakitate Japan, Gintama, Nichijou in no particular order!
>> ARTICLE
For me it has to be BakaTest
>> ARTICLE
For me, the king of comedies is none other than **Baka and Test**.

Holy mother of god I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. The dub is also one of the best English dubs to come out of Funimation imo.

Some clips

* [Lets play water devil!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoNxbSRWdaM)

* [King's Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_8FQchC9B0)

* [All the guys compete in the Miss Yukata contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ormk-scTmNc)

Another one of note is **My Bride is a Mermaid**. There wasn't an episode where I wasn't nearly in tears laughing.

* [First date!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj4bQXhlS5I)

* [Moe gangsters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfLlm63pqEM)

* [Implied yuri!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVdYAUAlemY)


Other than that, I'd have to say **D-Frag**, **Noucome**, and **Oreimo** had me bursting in laughter all the time.
>> ARTICLE
My faves for laughs are FLCL, B Gata H Kei, Sakura Trick, and the Persona 4 anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Beelzebub is really funny
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna have to say English dubbed Ghost Stories, and Baka to Test.
>> ARTICLE
I only just finished the third episode but Jinrui had me in stitches at some points
>> ARTICLE
Binbougami ga! made me taste death with laughter at times.
>> ARTICLE
Cromartie high school anyone? 
>> ARTICLE
Noucome, Daily Lives of Highschoolboys, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, and Baka to Test. 

To me all of these are the funniest anime I've ever watched.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Plastic Nee-San. It's so short, but it has so much actually funny insanity crammed into it.
>> ARTICLE
Chuunibyou because it was so embarrassing I started laughing (embarrassing as in digging into parts of my buried memories).
>> ARTICLE
Baka to Test. I watched every episode twice because i missed so much while laughing.
>> ARTICLE
To me, nothing compares to Golden Boy. Every episode was ridiculously funny and rather inspiring. Hope we get to see more of it.

The first season of Katekyo Hitman Reborn.

noucome was pretty hilarious. But don't forget detroit metal city! It gave me some of my biggest laugh attacks.
>> ARTICLE
Haganai
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo. Especially on the 45th episode.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched many 'comedies' but Skip Beat made me laugh so hard. Kyoko's evil laugh every time. XD
>> ARTICLE
Steins;gate. It's not often that I'll genuinely bust out into laughter when I'm watching something alone. We all know what it's like - it's easier to get into a comedic mindset when you're enjoying a piece of work with someone else. But Steins;gate just had me losing my shit solo over Okabe's antics early in. The crowning moment was the famous "I am mad scientist - it's SO COOL!" we all know and love.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say the jokes during Clannad got the most hard laughter out of me.
>> ARTICLE
Don't really know why you're being downvoted, Clannad had some downright hilarious moments.
>> ARTICLE
Ya, though it also had some pretty sad moments so no surprise if some people feel touchy hearing about it as funny.
>> ARTICLE
Plastic Nee-san was already said and it was so short so I will say Non Non Biyori. I frequently found myself laughing out loud at this when I watched this on a long car ride recently. Maybe it's just because I have soft spot Ren-chon but this show really cracked me up. "Didn't you own a mountain in Tokyo, Hotaru?"
>> ARTICLE
Either Oreimo, or Bobobobo back when i was 10.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is the winner for the most quality laughs. I found it a lot funnier than most "pure comedy" shows.
>> ARTICLE
**Danshi Koukousei to Nichijou**, **Clannad: After Story** & **Noucome** were series that made me laugh really hard
>> ARTICLE
I say....5 more hours until this thread pops up again...

More? Less? Place your bets!
>> ARTICLE
But we have to share our favorite OP/characters/couples/reaction faces/jokes/endings/fight scenes! Every day!
>> ARTICLE
As much as I despise reccuring threads I know not everyone can post in every one of those becasue there are things called time zones. I'd say we have "new" userbase every couple of hours. Not everyone is checking reddit every 5 minutes ^^like ^^me
>> ARTICLE
Threads stay alive long enough for every time zone to see them, though. This sub is pretty "casual" compared to other popular subreddits, but I kind of wish there was more moderation or that people took it a bit more seriously and didn't upvote practically everything. 

There is always, *always* a "what is your favorite _______" post on the front page. You'd think people would get tired of it, but apparently not.
>> ARTICLE
While the thread is definitely repetitive.. We all get to enjoy new music, so I'm not complaining :)

Futakotome is such an underrated monogatari OP, personally I think it's superior to staple stable. Unfortunately the video you posted is really distorted and low quality, I don't think there's a good version on youtube right now.

**Bold** for must-see anime, *italics* for must-hear pieces. 
>> ARTICLE
>What's your favorite opening song?
>> ARTICLE
Rolling girls op needs to be in italics kthx.
>> ARTICLE
this is perfect. Sakamichi no Melody is criminally underrated. Coupled with the OP scenes, I think its perfect. These are all really good though, have you considered the Eureka seveN OPs?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Sakamichi no Melody is great, I actually bought a single of it when I was in Japan (along with loads of other singles and OSTs for Cowboy Bebop and Sakamichi).

I haven't seen Eureka Seven and my PC is in a bit of a jeopardy right now, but I'll make sure to have a listen once it's back up ;)
>> ARTICLE
I never had a favorite but my top 5, in no particular order, is probably:

* [Flyers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjjTMNDZi-A)- Death Parade

>> ARTICLE
[Eureka Seven OP 1 - Days by flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo0jE0oXITk). OP2 and OP4 rank high as well though.
>> ARTICLE
How can you link to the first OP and not the second one? In my opinion the best one of the four.

[Eureka Seven OP 2- Shnen Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlkj_FVL0so)

[Link to full song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAifYag2_M)

It's also the only japanese song where I realized that it actually rhymes. That's kinda awesome on it's own for me.

Upvote for Lupin.  I looked up the variations and really, only the '78 and '80 (the one you picked) versions are the only ones that stand the test of time.  

'78, '79, '80: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWnD0yctyOk

'80 (2005 remake): https://youtu.be/-eGlPD3Lg-w?t=16s

'78 (2002 remake): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xga-BvbgE9A


>> ARTICLE
Glad you enjoyed it. Lupin '80 might be the most famous one, though I was raised with repetitive rebroadcast of the second season so I like these three versions with memories. 

Old anime songs have resonance, that I love and miss. 
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone mention Haru Modoki- Oregairu Zoku op? The tone, instrumentals, and vocals are so hype and feels at the same time.

My favorite is KLK's "Ambiguous" but "Harumodoki" is a close second. Such a great song.

I like [Goldran's OP at the moment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhzsrqj62mE)

I think it's better than Sorairo Days.
I mean listening to TTGL OP while watching the show is pretty great, but it doesn't have the catchyness thing as nearly as this for me. Well, we all know TTGL's osts are more famous than the OP anyways.

>> ARTICLE
[Akatsuki no yona ](https://youtu.be/KwFBcmhc0X0) - fantastic op with an amazing use of percussion and brass to emphasis epic adventure. Then awesome wind section backing. 

[Monogatari  hitage end ](https://youtu.be/8SwCnmUI8QI)- Monogatari  has somewhat of an unfair advantage since all op are amazing in there own right and change constantly. Its use of changing animation styles from colorful old school to drab usual kaiki influenced style. I could go into more depth but this op is full of symbolism. 

[Hanamonogatari](https://youtu.be/i27cViremYM) - very subtly but the tonely change mid op to represent kanbru relationship with the person is fantastic.

Not really my favorite, but I like Nanatsu no Taizai's [1st opening](http://web.archive.org/web/20150612104250/http://a.pomf.se/bsmibp.webm) a lot even though people seem to prefer the second one. It gives me strong Slayers vibes. (Slayers the anime, not the band)

Tougenkyou Alien is probably the perfect Gintama OP, especially with the animation. I fell in love with the song instantly.

There's too many great ones, might as well list them all.  is near the truly great ones, so I guess that's the most I can narrow it down.

Tokyo Ghoul's 1st opening - **Unravel**   
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's 1st opening - **Again**   
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's 2nd opening - **Hologram**  
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's 4th opening - **Period**  
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's 5th opening - **Rain**   
Cowboy Bebop's - **Tank!**  
Baccano!'s - **Gun's & Roses**  
Durarara!!'s 1st opening - **Uragiri no Yuyake**  
Durarara!!'s 2nd opening - **Complication**   
AnoHana's - **Aoi Shiori**  
Steins;Gate's - **Hacking to the Gate**  
Samurai Champloo's - **Battlecry**  
No Game No Life's - **This Game**  
TTGL's - **Sorairo Days**  
Tatami Galaxy's - **Maigoinu to Ame no Beat**  
Bakemonogatari's 1st opening - **Staple Stable**  

Ok, I almost forgot this one, but Trigun's opening is one of the coolest things you'll hear in your life and it's a god damn shame it doesn't have a full song duration. So [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzHe4U5c5Oc&ab_channel=Thedilo) it is.


The odds are I'm forgetting a few songs, so I'll make a Word document for these kinds of threads where I can just c/p this.

I was sure I wouldn't like Maria the Virgin Witch just by the show's name alone.
>> ARTICLE
Beat me to it. I watched the first episode as a joke, like "let's see how bad this premise gets", but the medieval fights and setting caught my attention.
>> ARTICLE
***Bakemonogatari.***

It had a "Vampire"-tag. *Yay, I hate vampires.*

It had a "Demons"-tag. *Yay, I hate demons.*

It has a "Horror"-tag. *Yay, I hate horror.*

(In hindsight: Those tags were horrible...) But I still went for it. Mainly due to my interest in comedy and romance.

Some notes I got when it was recommended to me were "It's one of those where you have to take a walk after an hour to digest what happened, you shouldn't binge it." "It consists of 80% dialogue between the characters" and "It relies heavily on art and weird humour."

When I first found out about this anime and started to watch it I did not look it up on MAL, and I have not been to this subreddit back then... so I didn't even know it was great and heavily popular. I went into it completely clueless.

Exceeded every expectation I had, killed all my doubts (and horrible genre-tags) and left me with one of my favorite franchises,

ladies and gentlemen:

[*Bakemonogatari*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari)
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Bakemonogatari because it was tagged as horror and supernatural... If someone would said to me that in this show boy and girl talks throughout entire episode, and then he beats a little girl... I would never touch it. I'm glad no one did... It's my favourite series now!
>> ARTICLE
Not really the genre of show I usually watch, but I loved [Skip Beat](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4722/Skip_Beat!), it became one of my favorites easily

read the manga, its AMAZING
>> ARTICLE
You might want to give [Glass Mask \(2005\)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1974/Glass_no_Kamen_%282005%29) a try too. It's a more serious take on acting, but it's surprisingly good. I put it on hold for a few months after watching the first episode, but when I picked it back up, I was hooked by the end of the second one.
>> ARTICLE
It looks really interesting, I'll definitely check it out, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass because of the mechas and Hunter x Hunter because the beginning is so childish and boring. 
>> ARTICLE
Exact same for Hunter X Hunter. I saw that the cast's main characters are two twelve year olds and assumed it was some kiddy friendship trip with lots of happiness and fun easy-going adventures. This is not the case. (although the friendship and adventures are quality)
>> ARTICLE
yamada kun to nananin no majo

Thought it was another generic highschool romcom that I'd watch to pass the time. Prior to that the only highschool romcom I  enjoyed was Nisekoi. 

**It is** a highschool romcom, but it's better than any of the previous ones I've seen and I love every second of it currently.
>> ARTICLE
I have it on my que on crunchy roll. I'm a sucker for generic romcoms haha

After I watched episode 3, I went and got caught up on the manga. Shouldn't have done that, now I'm waiting every week for a new chapter.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that show was going to be an awful adaption of a good manga but I was completely wrong. It has been great so far.
>> ARTICLE
Hated Kill la Kill for the first ~10 episodes, thought it was nothing more than a fanservice fest.. and by the end, it became one of my favourites, I really like how well it was all rounded up.
>> ARTICLE
I thought I would hate Kill la Kill for the same reason, but then Ryuko and Satsuki ended up being awesome. Mostly Satsuki.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter mainly because of the [cover art](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/33657l.jpg) when i looked at that I just didn't like how the characters looked and looked kinda boring to me but when I watched it I ended up really loving the show wishing there was to watch.

Yuru Yuri.

I actually despised it for the first two episodes, but I gave it another try a week later because I needed something comfy.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann

For some backstory on my taste in anime, I don't really like the over the top silly anime or over the top fan service, but my friend kept recommending this one to me so I watched the first episode and thought it was crazy but in the best way possible, I loved it and as the series went on it turned more from a silly anime to one the most motivational, saddest, and best anime I've ever seen. 
>> ARTICLE
This is one I thought I would enjoy and actually did not end up liking. I feel I am in the very small minority of people who did not really enjoy it.

>> ARTICLE
HOW DARE YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION THAN I DO!!!/s

When I first tried watching it i ended up dropping it around epsiode 6 I think. I went back and tried again because of a friends recommendation and after getting a couple more episodes in I enjoyed it. I gave it another shot in part because I didn't have plans for anything else yet.
>> ARTICLE
I'm the same. I heard everyone raving about it and found I completely lost interest after four or five episodes. It just didn't click for me.

[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](http://myanimelist.net/anime/849/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu). I came in expecting just another cute SoL. Boy was I wrong. It was a fun ride while it lasted...

[Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11179/Papa_no_Iukoto_wo_Kikinasai!) I actually started watching it on a whim. I came in expecting absolutely nothing. While it is most definitely not a masterpiece, I was very pleasantly surprised by how cute the story was.

Romeo's Blue Skies

Strike Witches. I thought it'd just be loli ecchi but because it has a lot of attention to detail and I'm a WW2 nerd I ended up loving it.

> it has a lot of attention to detail and I'm a WW2 nerd

Just for your information, the two Hawker Hurricanes that show up at the beginning of the first episode would not be able to climb that slow at that extreme an able of attack without stalling out long before reaching their destination. 
>> ARTICLE
When I first watched the first three episode of [Wanna Be the Strongest in the World](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11763/Sekai_de_Ichiban_Tsuyoku_Naritai!) it left a fairly terrible impression on me, but by the end of it (episode 12) I gave it a 9/10.

See, for me, if I'm at least at the 3rd episode and still not feeling it, I just say screw it lol

I was dropping too many shows in-between [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica) & Wanna Be the Strongest in the World, the only reason I got to the fourth episode (which is where it got better for me) was because weather I like it or not, at the time I told myself the I had to complete the show because of dropping too many.
>> ARTICLE
It is a LOT of training and protagonist suffering early on. But it definitely picks up later on with some fantastic wrestling matches near the end of the series.
>> ARTICLE
The Monogatari series. I thought it would be really dumb, the central relationship would go nowhere (like in all good harems) and that it would have very boring visual presentation. Mostly I thought it would be a "romantic" "comedy".

&nbsp;

Shinsekai Yori or From the New World. I thought it would bore me while still being well made. The slow pacing didn't bore me though. 
>> ARTICLE
Damnit, already said Nichijou for a similar thread...

I'll go with [Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14741/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai!). When it started, it had everything that I would've hated, a bland looking MC (Makoto), a weird girl who got annoying (Rikka), an annoying assistant (Sanae), and it to me looked like it was going to be crap, but...I actually really enjoyed it. Makoto turned out to be a good MC, Rikka I actually really loved by the end of it, and I just overall loved the theme and message of it to be a great ride. I thought it was really well done, related to it quite a bit, and made me not judge too quickly. Now to get to the second season at some point...
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter... On the surface it looked like your average, generic shounen... Until the Yorknew City Arc.

*Cowboy Bebop*. 
 
I saw the 'space western' tag and assumed it would be something like anime Star Wars (which, for me, was mostly *meh*). It turned out to be a fantastic experience and also led me to *Samurai Champloo*. Both of them are now in my top ten list.

Ping Pong the Animation since I had never watched a sports anime before and the artwork was different. Watched it anyways and it turned out to be amazing.
>> ARTICLE
So Ra No Wo To was like that for me recently. I had zero interest in anything army but wow was that ever a fun watch!

Haikyuu!! was the one that started me on my sports binges :p

The whole anime was pretty good but the last few episodes blew me away. I think it deserves so much more for what it is.

Yeah I did not expect those last couple episodes, they were really amazing. Serious but nothing too crazy or forced

> I had zero interest in anything army but wow was that ever a fun watch!

Makes sense, everyone who wanted a military anime felt the opposite.
>> ARTICLE
Based on shit opinions I read online, I had a very negative bias of Naruto before going into it. Now, it will always go down as one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it depends how you watch it, if you end up waiting a week only to see flashbacks that's you've already seen the hate will build up.
>> ARTICLE
I've been kinda pissed about the current filler arc, sure, but that doesn't mean I'm going to hate the series overall.
>> ARTICLE
At some parts the pacing even out of fillers is terrible. I mean an earlier episode of Shippuden looked like Naruto and Orichimaru were about to fight, the next episode was basically showing Naruto leaking out Nine-tails chakra and getting angry, but the fight wasn't until the NEXT episode.

Also seeing Naruto and Sasuke's past a few dozen times gets annoying after awhile. There is still personal opinion for it though, so I shouldn't have said that that it depends entirely on how you watch it.
>> ARTICLE
*Hourou Musuko* (*Wandering Son*).  As I mentioned in my \[WT!\] post for the series, I didn't imagine myself enjoying a serious slice-of-life drama about two gender-dysphoric middle-school students.  And on that count, I was very mistaken.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad - I usually only like action anime but I tried Clannad because of the high rating and to see how sad it was. Didn't like it at first but it grew on me and ended up marathoning After Story in 1 day. Although it wasn't as sad as people make it out to be. I've seen sadder moments in other anime
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to say that might be somehow connected to you marathoning it in a day. I think a lot about Clannad AS's effect in the end for me came from watching it over one week. I guess giving it some time so that you can let it sink in was important for me.
>> ARTICLE
Thought i wouldn't like Ben-To based on the premise, but I ended up loving the silliness and over the top action.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't make any sense but it's still great lol!

Toradora pleasantly surprised me by being a romantic comedy that I actually liked. It got me into rom-com anime (anime does the genre quite well, and I love it).

Madoka Magika. Not the type of genre I like to watch but the art and the story are awesome.

My pride wouldn't let me watch it for the longest time. I just couldn't do it. But when I did, I had no regrets.

[Free](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18507/Free!)! and [Mayo Chiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10110/Mayo_Chiki!)!

Did not expect a sports anime to be good. Did not expect Mayo Chiki to be as enjoyable as it was.
>> ARTICLE
Defense Club. Watched because I saw a lot of moments in Tumblr so I thought *"Whatever, I'm gonna watch it just for the luls, I hope magic won't get in a way."* and ended up loving the shit out of the plot twist, rated the show 8 overall.

Death Note. It was more than I thought was two gay dudes fighting over a notebook.
>> ARTICLE
Just anime in general, I couldn' imagine myself loving it, just about a month ago.

I thought I'd hate NGE. One could argue that a harder smack to a former self's face has never been more deserved.
>> ARTICLE
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumyia. I watched it cause I had heard about Endless Eight and "Kyon-kun denwa" so I was curious about a show that would have eight of the same episode. It turned into my favorite series.
>> ARTICLE
Before I even knew the hype about Haruhi a friend showed me the first episode in the airing order. It seemed like the cheesiest anime ever made. I dropped at thatpoint until last year when I rewatched the whole thing. I honestly didn't think I'd like it. I wonder how people reacted when the first episode aired back in 06.

Kill la Kill, I thought it would be some over the top weaboo shit, but it was a hilariously fun anime.

Ping Pong: The Animation...I kept putting it off just because of the art, I couldn't like it no matter what so I made a deal with a friend...I'd watch it as long as he watched other one I suggested xD It really surprised me about how much it focused in the characters and development, since I do like table tennis as well, after I got used to the art there was no problem at all, I would go as far as to call it a masterpiece (imo) now and recommend it to anyone :p
>> ARTICLE
So far, Dragon Ball Z Kai.

Had never watched anything Dragon Ball in my life, so one night, I recorded it on Toonami.  I wasn't really expecting much.

But now, I can confirm that I actually really enjoyed it; nothing groundbreaking, but I like it enough to keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
Terraformars , favorite anime/manga . It might be the thing Ived always wanted but never asked for and didn't know I wanted.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica and The Idolm@ster. I thought both would be too girly for me...one turned out to be dark and depressing, but really good...the other..pretty funny and definitely memorable!
>> ARTICLE
So the other day I  finally picked up Psychopass, I finished last night and absolutely loved it, definitly top 5, maybe even top 3. I put it off for a long time because for some reason I thought I wouldn't like it, I've never been so wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
Attack on Titan. I only really resisted because advertisements for it were everywhere when I was in Japan and everyone and their dog told me to watch it at some point (yes apparently I'm an anime hipster). 

I finally caved, and finished the series in a marathon ending at 4 AM... 1 hour before I had to fly internationally. 
>> ARTICLE
It hasn't come to an end yet but Food Wars! is something that I've really enjoyed that I didn't really want to watch at first. Based on the show's synopsis I thought it was going to be a "slice of life" sort of thing which isn't something I wanted to get into right now but it really didn't turn out like that at all. I finally gave it a go because someone told me I should watch it and now I can't wait for each new episode. The whole "Everyone has an orgasm every time they eat the MC's food" is a little silly though.
>> ARTICLE
**C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control** [link](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10163/C:_The_Money_of_Soul_and_Possibility_Control).

When I first heard of this, it didn't look that impressive. Actually it looked pretty low budget and pretty terrible, but I figured it had something to do with money so maybe it was worth a shot.

Story, somewhat predictable. Animation, alright. Romance subplot, bad dudes, fighting etc. Really just not my cup of tea to throw all of that into one anime.

Watched it, was pretty impressed it held my attention, and wasn't so bad. Hell it was even somewhat enjoyable. Was this an anime I loved? No, but at least I didn't feel my time was wasted. 7/10, expected 1/10.

Also look at the reviews on MAL, similar experiences.

Nisekoi...

Durarara. All through the beginning I was just thinking "This is what they're doing instead of more baccano?" But when it grabbed me, it really grabbed me. 
>> ARTICLE
TTGL only because I forced myself to watch it since I saw Kill La Kill first. 
>> ARTICLE
Girls und Panzer, really. Because it seemed like some boring-ass moeblob with the sole selling point being tanks. And girls randomly doing tank things seemed weird. 

Marathoned it in one go, did not regret a thing. Darjeeling is queen. 
>> ARTICLE
Kimi To Boku was about guys so I have only watched girls slice of life before that and I thought it would be boring and not cute. But damn it is cute, entertaining, lovable, easy to relate to, very slice of life and has amazing art.
>> ARTICLE
Girls Und Panzer. I watched it mostly as a joke because I have a friend who loves more and plays world of tanks a lot. He kept telling me it was actually good and I would say that it was a show made just for him. When I finally watched it I loved it, fantastic show.
>> ARTICLE
The exact same thing happened for me with Baby Steps. Didn't expect it to be so good... who knew an anime about Tennis could actually be awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Love Live! happened to be the first Moe anime I encountered, and I expected much less of it.

I was pleasantly surprised.
>> ARTICLE
[Shokugeki no Souma](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28171/Shokugeki_no_Souma) - Still airing but I got to say... I never thought I would ever love a ecchi cooking show.
>> ARTICLE
I actually don't have many moments like this, because I generally try to get an idea of what I'm watching before I watch it, even if it leads to some spoilers (I totally don't mind spoilers, I enjoy the execution of stories just as much as the events themselves), so I everything I even try to watch is something I am already mildly interested in.

That being said, the closest experience to this is with Appleseed the movie, I thought I would really dislike it from the onset because I have an irrational dislike of 3D CG (trying to get over it for Knights of Sidonia), so I thought I would hate it no matter what. But I liked it in the end, the setting, characters, and story all hit soft spots of mine and I ended up liking the film!
>> ARTICLE
Psycho Pass. I'm not a big fan of dark Animes as most of the ones i've seen have been poorly done or just failed at being "dark". Not sure if i have just been overlooking the good ones but i absolutely loved Psycho Pass 1 and 2 and its easily one of my favorite Animes.

S1 certainly doesn't fail at being dark. That standoff scene...

Didn't realize it whoops :( but by the feedback looks like a lot of people didn't mind it 
>> ARTICLE
I wish Baby Steps would get more love considering its driven heavily by a main character who actually receives character development and not just DBZ powers like Koroku or Prince of Tennis. The story is pretty unpredictable since I couldn't ever really definitively tell when the MC was actually going to win or not which was pretty refreshing in a way. There is also zero NTR, harem, or as I mentioned ridiculously over the top DBZ level moves that typically have ruined some of my favorite sports anime over the course of watching them. Overall, the show is pretty good 7/10. It still has the potential to get better, especially considering season two is going to be released and if they stick to the manga things should definitely be heading on the up and up. 
>> ARTICLE
I honestly don't think Baby Steps could have been better with that budget. It isn't top tier but certainly good and enjoyable, which is a huge feat for such a poorly animated show.

The manga is fantastic though, wish the pacing would improve a bit but otherwise it's great.

Pretty much this . I haven't seen some some of them


>> ARTICLE
Cross Game is number 1 by far, like really far.

Then in a distant, but still realllly good is Chihayafuru
>> ARTICLE
I recommend Hajime no Ippo so that Cross Game isn't so alone at your top ;D
>> ARTICLE
It's not everyday I see Cross Game mentioned here, I am so happy. Favorite anime by far, and I don't even like Baseball.
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely one of my favorite romances. Perfect atmosphere and pacing. And for an anime to have a recap episode that made me cry, it has to be genius.
>> ARTICLE
100% agree. Also in my top 5 anime. And for a 50 episode semi-SoL show to be so perfectly paced is quite astounding. 

Probably the only show ever to make me jump up in joy [Cross Game](/s "when Akaishi gets a hit and Azuma gets the run in episode 48"). Absolutely amazing atmosphere.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game was... just... like... man. No words. 

That first episode, that penultimate episode. That [](/s "confession")

 
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Can I lie?"). Such a great moment and memorable line.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely my favorite first episode in any anime. Honestly was a little worried after seeing that, wonder how the show could keep up after such a strong opener. But at least for me, the story stayed as strong or got BETTER as the characters evolved and grew up.
>> ARTICLE
It really did. Cross Game is a great example of a character driven narrative, so well done that they could have easily gone for another fifty episodes without ever running out of good idea's.
>> ARTICLE
I'm probably in the minority of disliking the first episode. I loved everything about the show except probably the biggest event in it 
>> ARTICLE
Girls und Panzer
>> ARTICLE
GuP will always be the best sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
Tankery is the best sport, until someone makes something similar with airplanes.
>> ARTICLE
So Strike Witches?
>> ARTICLE
Sort of, but not quite. Strike Witches *is* my favorite anime, but what I'm thinking is that you combine the tournament style progression of GuP with WWII-era prop airplanes. And keep the "cute girls"-aspect ofc.
>> ARTICLE
I want this so desperately
>> ARTICLE
Anything that involves WWII-era war military machinery and cute girls is something I'd like to watch.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get past the first five minutes of Strike Witches myself, but I loved GuP and Kantai Collection has been great so far (although I am a couple episodes behind due to not having time recently).
>> ARTICLE
I actually started KanColle last night myself! Only two eps in so far, but its looking good. I'm not surprised that you had difficulties with the first minutes of Strike Witches TBH. Even though I love the series I think it could've done okay without flashing ass all the time(and give the poor girls some pants already!).

Haikyuu!! 

Watching Ping Pong right now, looks like it might become one of my favorites.

Easily Major for me. Great group of characters, Probably still had the best baseball action of the 3 I watched and the shit Goro had to go through man...tugged at the strings at times. 

After that Haikyuu!! is a 10/10 to me and Cross games is just amazing as well. I re-watch it every year.
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko and Ippo ofc c:
>> ARTICLE
[Wanna Be the Strongest in the World](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11763/Sekai_de_Ichiban_Tsuyoku_Naritai!) is top spots anime for me. It turned out to be a surprisingly good wrestling underdog story.
>> ARTICLE
1. Major
2. Hajime no Ippo
3. Chihayafuru 
4. Haikyuu 
5. Ping Pong the Animation 
6. One Outs

Sports is definitely my favorite genre of anime, so many feel good shows.
>> ARTICLE
Are you me? This is pretty much exactly my list except Kuroko No Basuke would be 4th or 5th. I love them all, but Major and Hajime No Ippo are definitely my favourites. Hit me right in the feels again and again.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely, the emotion that flows through you during games in the shows is just epic!
>> ARTICLE
Surprised there is no Diamond no Ace here.

That being said, Ippo is a fantastic sports anime(and manga), right up there with Ashita no Joe
>> ARTICLE
One thing I'm confused about Daiya No Ace is why everyone seems to use Diamond No Ace as the English versions rather than The Ace Of Diamonds, which would make more sense.
>> ARTICLE
Because that's how it's said in Japanese. I always use Japanese titles as opposed to the English versions.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly can't decide between Ping Pong and Cross Game. I used to like shows like Prince of Tennis a lot (and I still do enjoy them) because I got to see really cool and imaginative (albeit unrealistic) depictions of the sport of tennis. Watching it was one of the reasons I got into playing tennis in elementary and middle school. 

In the last few years; however, after watching Cross Game (and more recently Ping Pong), I was shocked at how sports anime could go so in-depth on having us understand the athletes as human beings, and how that affected the overall experience. Also, both shows still had those heart-stopping moments of shows like Prince of Tennis, which made an already entertaining show even more of a joy to experience. 
>> ARTICLE
Since noone has mentioned it yet: Saki
>> ARTICLE
Slam Dunk
>> ARTICLE
Mu favorite sports anime and manga is [Chihayafuru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10800/Chihayafuru).

I won't say that I'm well versed in sports anime, but since most all of them have long and somewhat dragged out. The only reason I haven't started watching Kuroko no basket is because I'm not sure if the []( /s "pink haired managers relationship") with Kuroko is only played of as a joke or not.
>> ARTICLE
Does that mean you don't want it to be a joke, or you do?
>> ARTICLE
Rather not, but from what I have seen of Kuroko has made me want to watch it once S3 has finnished airing during the summer. If you do know a tagged Yes or no anwser would be nice.
>> ARTICLE
Well [](/s "I wouldn't call it a joke persay, but Kuroko does not have romance.")

[Slightly more detail that I'm not sure you want or not](/s "The "relationship" you mention is just a one-sided love rather than a relationship and doesn't come up much either.")
>> ARTICLE
How come noone mentions goddamn Captain Tsubasa?!? Tho I personally also enjoy Super Kicker, not sure how much is nostalgia there tho.
>> ARTICLE
For me it's Hungry Heart over Captain Tsubasa. Both are epic football anime
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo, Koruko no Basket and that's it because I don't really watch sports anime and the two that I watched were pretty long. However Ippo is amazing, inspiring and is my favorite anime it's just that I wasn't into sports anime before then.

Favourite Most realistic Sports anime :

 Giant Killing (football) everything about this anime is Perfect if you know your football especially if you have knowledge of the premier league .

Favourite 'super powers' Sports anime:

Eyeshield 21 I dont like american Hand egg but this anime is great and pumps me up 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it in over 10 years, but I remember I loved Captain Tsubasa as a kid.
>> ARTICLE
**Princess Nine** Great character interactions, nice underdog story of a highschool girls baseball team competing with all boys baseball teams, nice love triangle, nice dramatic tension throughout the show, great music, fun and inventive baseball tactics. It's a really overlooked gem and I really recommend it. 

**Big Windup! (Ookiku Furikabutte)** Arguably one of the best sports shows as far as mental games go. Ever wonder what goes through the mind of a sports player when they go over tactics in a second-to-second basis? This show does a great job of that. This show really shows off how mentally taxing sports really is in serious competition. Every single nervous tick, every inch of movement, it is thoroughly analyzed and broken down. It truly is a sports science centric show.

**Yowamushi Pedal** Show with a gleeful love and passion of cycling. Makes sense considering the manga's creator is a big cycling fan. There's a lot of cycling tactics and strategy at play plus enough outlandish character abilities to really make the races pop. Fantastic music and has enough unpredictability to make each race outcome feel fresh.

Holy shit. First time I've seen Hungry Heart mentioned on the sub. That was good stuff.

This is the one I love the most out of the lot. It's not mentioned much because it had a short run. Definitely underrated.

Inspired me to play football

The first Rugby anime that comes out.

Seriously though, Hajime no Ippo.

But seriously though, (good) Rugby anime/manga when? Japan has the Rugby world cup in 2019 so maybe we'll get something around then.

You guys should try hungry heart. Only 52 episodes. But it's really nice and underrated.

>**Only** 52 episodes
For many people here anything with more than 24 episode is a lot.

The show looks fun tho and it's football so I'll at least give it a try.

Kuroko no basket and Diamond no ace
>> ARTICLE
Does Little Busters count (despite the fact that the anime itself has even less focus on baseball than the novel)?  I rather enjoyed it (even though the visual novel is definitely better than the adaption) even if it did have some flaws.  I also thought that Chihayafuru was pretty great, but it's been quite a while since I've seen it, so I need to rewatch it sometime soon.  Although I'm not entirely sure if Silver Spoon should count (the focus of the show is more like a slice of life than anything else), it is an amazing anime and does have some pretty good moments with horse related sports.  If anyone hasn't seen Silver Spoon yet, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat.  It's from the creator of Fullmetal Alchemist, has a large cast of great characters (and character development), a great plot (at least for a slice of life), and can make you get emotional over a pig.

I really need to sit down and watch some more sports anime sometimes soon.  I've heard great things about both Ping Pong and Cross Game, so hopefully I'll be able to get to them before too long.

P.S.  If we count dog fighting as a sport, I definitely enjoyed Pokemon as a child (even if I did stop watching in the middle of the season with May and her annoying brother).  I have seen all of the movies though.
>> ARTICLE
Ippo, Chihayafuru, Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
I dont really watch much of it but **Hajime no Ippo** makes boxing look like  the epitome of phisical sports in my eyes.

The rock music, the impact of the blows, the mind games, the comedy and training montages make for an incredibly intense and fun show.
>> ARTICLE
Yowamushi Pedal 

Started out with the wrong attitude watching it because i used to think sports anime were dumb. So i started to watch as a joke and before I knew it I had marathon 8 episodes! The MC is just so like-able and the characters around him fill the other archetypes to round out the show. I've been caught up since the second season started and now i'm super bummed that it ends next week. 
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo
>> ARTICLE
Haikyu is fun, I really like Ace no Diamond so far its got a great pace to it. You can never go wrong with Hajime no Ippo which has some of my favorite scenes in all of anime, and Slam Dunk is one of my favorite manga, probably top 3.

Cross Game, no contest, not even close
>> ARTICLE
Does Girls und Panzer count as sport?
>> ARTICLE
Definitely Prince of Tennis. Kuroko no Basuke. Does Hikaru no Go count as a sport or a game?
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong the animation. It has something unique compared to others sports anime, its called Character Development. O.o
>> ARTICLE
My favorites are Kuruko no Basket and I've started Diamond no Ace and that's pretty good. 
>> ARTICLE
Never seen one. Intend to keep it that way.
>> ARTICLE
Why's that?
>> ARTICLE
They suck balls    
edit: no pun intended

All sports anime is the same: too much dialogue describing what's going on, friendship/teamwork speeches mid game, hard working protagonist, etc.

except ping pong  

so ping pong

I've seen 67, and I've still yet to get to Bebop, Beck, and Death Note (although I read the manga once upon a time, so I have no real motivation to go watch Death Note at the moment).  Kyoukai No Kanata movie is on my radar as well, even though I wasn't too impressed by the series itself.  

Its nice to see my favorite (Kino's Journey) make the list though.

I need to get around to watching Death Note. I've just heard so much about the second half ...it's hard not wanting to get invested.

Also, I'm still surprised people like Shigatsu/Your Lie In April so much. I mean I enjoyed it, but wouldn't think of it as #10 (in this list).
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Death Note yesterday actually and I can see why people enjoy the first half more but the second half is still really thrilling! 

Yeah same! I guess people really like their feels anime

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
yes. not watching bebop is a crime
>> ARTICLE
It's a crime Bebop isn't in the top 10 :(
>> ARTICLE
Bebop is too overrated and too overhyped
>> ARTICLE
its just not your taste, but im sure like 80% of people here think differently as you.
>> ARTICLE
My statement may be incorrect. Let's say that i wouldn't recommend it as a first anime to someone.
>> ARTICLE
How come? I'm curious. Especially since you gave it a 9.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously don't remember anymore lol, that was a long time ago when i started watching anime. I guess i said that because there are animes that i would watch rather than Bebop. It's really great, but not that "holy shit" great. I have to watch it again some day, wish it wasn't episodic.
>> ARTICLE
I see lol I have anime that I would rather watch than Bebop but I still think it's one of the best out there. Different perspective I guess.

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, while it's a great classic, a classic shouldn't be held to a higher value than newer anime simply because it's a classic. That's called being biased.
>> ARTICLE
But how did Bebop come to be considered a classic? It has an interesting, compelling story with a fantastic ending, unique characters, fantastic animation that still holds up to newer animation and it has one of the best soundtracks in all of anime. All of these contribute to why it's considered a class and are why it should be in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it does have all of that, and that's exactly why I call it a great anime. However, putting it in the top 10 of all anime isn't as cut and dry as that. There are plenty of anime that are as you described, certainly more than 10. A top 10 list simply cannot be anything but subjective. So it's not a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10. The top 10 on MAL is simply a popularity figure, it's not objective at all. It's a rough approximation of an anime's true worth at its best.
>> ARTICLE
That's true and since it's all subjective and this is all based on my opinion, *I* think it's a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I strongly believe it doesn't deserve top 10.

 Bebop is great, but it's episodic, and many people prefer a coherent story over a series of short stories, even if the characters and settings are interesting

Downvotes for not believing a show is top 10? I even think it's good, just not top 10 anime of all time... wtf.
>> ARTICLE
So much this yes. I watched Bebop only 2 days ago after my 3 years of Anime watching only to see that it is damn overrated. Characters were great, sound was amazing, stories were entertaining and execution was top notch. One of the best shows I have watched but it seriously lacked a plot. You can easily make connections with characters but events were so unrelated you never feel the show as a whole to like it so much. Just look at  [Cowboy Bebop](/s "what happened to Julia after all that hype? She just died."). You are exactly right about the show being episodic. Thus there is no room for Bebop at top 10. 

When I see people claim Bebop is one of the best shows I think that people are trying to show off that they pick a classic old show as their favorite to feel somehow superior against the people who like new, popular stuff. It is the same as people hating on SAO for no apparent reason other than it being popular. I didn't watch the second season but first season was definitely a good entertaining normal show. Same hate on Kirito too. Kirito is not some outstanding character to be the favorite character for anyone but he is not that notable as a bad character to become anyone's most hated character either. Just because he is popular, no reason to hate on him to show off your *unique/s* and *mature/s* taste.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial. It's kind of like saying a SOL show is better than an action/adventure show just because it fits into the SOL genre and a certain group of people like SOL more.

People having a problem with the actual content of an episodic show is one thing but saying it's not great *because* its episodic is completely different.

>> ARTICLE
If you're issue is being invested in the fate of the characters, because at the end of the episode everything reverts back to ~ status quo, and there's no longer arc to get heavily invested in the characters.




>> ARTICLE
This isn't necessarily true.  Certain episodic shows have more development per episode than others.  Not all episodic shows are law and order.
>> ARTICLE
That's a different issue that has to deal with the actual content of the episodes including the characters.

Also, Bebop does have an overarching story that's highlighted in specific episodes that helps you feel connected to the characters. If Bebop was really a completely episodic show with no main plot then the ending wouldn't have hit as hard as it did.
>> ARTICLE
>I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial

If a work from of a medium tailored for storytelling falls short on storytelling, it's a pretty legitimate argument to make.
>> ARTICLE
I agree but that comes down to the actual story being told not simply the format of storytelling.
>> ARTICLE
Never understood the hype. Watched it a few years back because it's supposedly divine and untouchable, but it looked rather bland to me.
>> ARTICLE
It's episodic nature isn't for everyone. I could defend it all day long as my favorite anime but the most recent rewatch thread had really great write ups and does a much better job. If you read some (episode 5 and the last few are probably the better ones) you may find some appreciation for it.

Ooo boy, you're missing out.

Noragami was not in the top 100 before the top 100, so it's the newest member because it's a completely new entry. Haikyuu!! season 1 was already in the top 100, and while it moved up due to season 2, it isn't really a new member.

Yeah this really shows off myanimelist's recency bias which I honestly think is not as bad as this sub's.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've rated some of the old shows I've watched quite highly, but if they came out today I'd have rated them lower.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe newer shows are better
>> ARTICLE
Irionically I feel that after signing up to MAL back around August 2015, I've rated some of my favorite shows of the past with rose-colored glasses.  Like, I'm pretty sure if I rewatched R.O.D. OVA now, it would no longer be 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I go back maybe once a year and re-rate things to more match what Im feeling over the long term.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously look at the numbers for 2011-2014 3/4 years have 9 entries and 2013 must've been a pretty barren year to only get 5. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, Japan produces ~5x as many shows a year these days, so you might want to take that into account.
>> ARTICLE
Also the fact that (just like movies, books, music 
, etc.) people and generations change - thier interests and perceptions shift, tropes go in and out of fashion. It's fine not to like something classic because it was made by different folks for different folks. Things that transcend that are very rare. Worst case scenario - this shows that the average MAL user is around 20. Maybe even not because there are less older users but because in the past decade or so, popularity of manga/anime in the west has exploded.

More often than not, we just have something very dear to us and we can't accept that stuff we don't like surpass it in quality and popularity. Because we want to think that if something is good, we will like it and by extension - if we like something, it must be good. Thus - recency bias explains that away really well for us.
>> ARTICLE
Also animation quality is going up. I don't really care if you think the older style is more appealing; recent shows have been pushing limits with [backgrounds](http://i.imgur.com/aqnN7Zp.gifv), [foregrounds, and effects](http://i.imgur.com/i5pRxBN.gifv).

The only show that really feels like the old cell animation fits better than digital imo is Trigun. I love the graininess, but new animation is definitely higher quality.
>> ARTICLE
I think there is something missing for very specific types of show, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and especially the absolutely gorgeous Ghost in the Shell movie all benefited from either the grittiness and colouring/shading styles of older animation.

I feel its a similar way to how Noir films benefit from being black and white.

Did you combine FMA and FMA:B? Or is it just legitimately not in the top 100? I'm not sure which option is worse.
>> ARTICLE
The original is not in the top 100.
>> ARTICLE
That's a shame, the original gets so much flack even though it has better early character development, a better OST, and the better movie. I also like how [](/s "it takes more than 10 people to make a philosopher stone")
>> ARTICLE
There was always certain things that bugged me about the original. I wasn't a fan of how the homunculi were handled, I liked the idea of the villain in the original but I thought Brotherhood's was more interesting, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I love father way more than Dante, but at least there was consequences in the original. Everything seems to convenient in brotherhoods end game. There is also the fact that everyone just kinda watched as greed died. Everyone holds brotherhood way higher than the original when in reality they are pretty balanced in their strengthens and faults, but if you have watched the 2003 previously brotherhood becomes a lot better. Where as the opposite is not true. 
>> ARTICLE
I imagine watching Brotherhood first is a bit like watching DBZ and then going to the older original Dragonball when it wasn't all about the fights.
>> ARTICLE
This is better. Evangelion not being in the top 200 was giving me serious buttpain. Also glad to see Disappearance closer to the #1 position it once upon a time righteously held.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually disgusted by the fact that everyone keeps mentioning evangelion like it's the greatest masterpiece ever and then I look at it's myanimelist rating and I think it is where it should be, similiar about the mentions of madoka magica.

And then there is Hajime no Ippo, a show that is so damn good, yet people won't try it cause there is some "pact" that people don't want to watch sports anime, and only mention of it is when someone asks other good sports anime in a haikyuu!! (great anime though) thread, and it gets mentioned afterwards fucking baby steps...

smh.
>> ARTICLE
Well, NGE is one of the (very, very) few anime i would consider a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Le 8.3 average rating, what a masterpiece.

Just wondering, why did you rate Death Note a 10 if you dropped it?

Death note to me is Light vs L. That's where the anime ends.
>> ARTICLE
[But](/s "didn't L die in episode 25, not 18?")
>> ARTICLE
L vs Light, not L *with* Light
>> ARTICLE
NGE is either the most impactful anime on art in general or the third msot impactful ever. I mean, we're talking about *an anime* which influenced the *Western film industry* more than a lot of actual Western film masterpieces ffs. NGE is like 100x more important to science fiction than GITS is for any **real** sci-fi fan and sci-fi is a lot bigger than just anime! You seriously have to be like 15 if you don't understand how big of a fucking deal NGE is, when in just anime alone it popularized (didn't originate, necessarily) huge swathes of standard tropes and is at most the second most impactful show for the industry (after the original astroboy ofc).

EDIT: You're like someone who is insulting the position of Diablo 2 as possibly the most influential video game that will ever be produced after, like, the early 80's.
>> ARTICLE
That is of course one way of looking at it. Again, it is a good anime - masterpiece? I don't think so.

By that, I'll put Dragonball and Z as a masterpiece, even though it had it's flaws. I even rate DBZ higher than evangelion  as an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not a masterpiece. If you really can't recognize that it was a masterpiece and one of the most impactful works of anime or science fiction of the 90's, [you've got a serious disease for which there is no cure.](http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarCHcNNbZRIpsyY/giphy.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Are you serious? How can you say it is even a masterpiece by todays standards when it is rated low compared to other anime... the point stands that its only 8.3 and maybe higher/lower in other forums. I agree with that rating. That rating shouldn't be called a fucking masterpiece.

What does it matter that it was influential in anime. Do you think Survivor (still a great show) is also a masterpiece cause it greatly influenced reality tv shows? 
>> ARTICLE
Um, It's got a low rating because it's actual art and a lot of people can't handle the concept of anime as art, not because it deserves such a shitty low rating. Just take your shit opinions and go troll somewhere else, mate.
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding me? How is my opinion troll? You are the one being ignorant here that you can't understand that people just don't think it's that amazing.what does actual art even mean? Are you some kind of snob who thinks their opinion is better than others?

Well, nothing else to say than I am sorry that you have grown up to have such a big ego.

It is not a masterpiece in my eyes, and according to ratings and comments, a lot of people have the same opinion, so fuck off.

So apparently some* people think OPM is bad now. 

http://i.imgur.com/ZAfVGax.gifv

Edit: No this is not about the people who think it isn't top 10. There's a lot of anime out there so odds are there are 10 other shows you enjoyed more.

I've just noticed a lot of people who are disgusted by OPM even being on the list. Even if you don't enjoy the action or comedy, it's confusing that people can think it's not objectively a well made anime, even with all the praise it has earned.
>> ARTICLE
We're not saying it's bad it's just not top 7. I think top 15-25.

OPM isn't even my favorite from this year.
>> ARTICLE
There's a difference between bad and not top 10 material.
>> ARTICLE
I think it deserves top 10, there's a reason why it's so well loved and famous.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. You're absolutely correct in that there's a reason it's well loved and famous. It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

/u/icedino said (implied, rather) that OPM isn't top ten material. To be fair, that's his own opinion and he's entitled to it, just as you're entitled to your own. More people than not found it to be top ten material, so by definition it's top ten material, assuming it holds its place in the coming months. It's just not necessarily in EVERYONE'S top ten.
>> ARTICLE
> It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

Also hype. Let's not kid ourselves, there are so many anime series that can be considered better but simply don''t have the amount of mainstream hype OPM does. Hell even in the top 100. Do you think the average mainstream anime fan has heard of LogH or Cross Game? They're still in the top 100 for a good reason. The reason why CG or LoGH don't have a huge anti-movement is *because* it hardly ever gets talked about (respective to huge hypes like SAO/AOT/OPM that is).
>> ARTICLE
I think it's too soon to say whether or not OPM is top 10 *of all time* material. A few seasons from now we'll be able to tell whether it's high rating is because of it's recent hype or because everyone truly believes that it's the 7th best anime of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
It's lost like .05 points over the past two weeks.

Dropped from 10 to 11, giving the first season of gintana its spot back.

Yeah but there's also a reason why the current top 10 were loved. Besides, they're always be people who just like to shit on anything main stream. It's really good but still over hyped.
>> ARTICLE
> There's a difference between bad and not top 10 material.

Who gets to decide what's top 10 material though? Wouldn't it be the collection of MAL user scores rather than just a couple of people who don't think it's top 10 material?

It's just my opinion that the show doesn't deserve as much praise as it is given and definitely not to be the seventh best anime of all time. Would still put it in my top 40 or something.  
But hey, your opinion is different - that's fine too.

I don't think it should be seventh either but I'm not surprised about it. People like it because it's funny and easy to get into and they're gonna give it 10s and 9s. Nothing to be surprised about.

Recency bias coupled with the fact that it went mainstream is correlated with this, makes complete sense.

I know you're most likely using the term "recency bias" to fuck with me again, but that doesn't apply here *at all.* 

People aren't choosing between two different anime, you're just scoring them separately. You don't have to choose between Cowboy Bebop or Hunter x Hunter for 10/10's, it's not a contest like that. And it's not as if people are saying "Oh wow, this anime just came out in 2015! That makes it automatically better than this 2001 anime." nor is it the case that because recent anime are going to tend to be more popular (OPM is at #91 in popularity anyways) that they'll automatically rank in the top 100 as Ashita no Joe, Ping Pong, and LoGH have proven.

I wonder if OPM didn't get that much hype that it could take a higher spot. I mean before the anime was announced the One Punch Man community was at least average in number but still a little unknown. /r/OnePunchMan didn't even have their own subreddit style and I'm happy just to see a reference out of nowherein reddit. It was one manga that if you read before the adaptation, you couldn't imagine to be animated just because of the art(of the manga).
>> ARTICLE
If they animated it in ONE's style it could have become another Ping Pong :)
>> ARTICLE
Very likely.  People would have regarded it as an underrated gem with the quality of its animation.  Personally, the show was extremely entertaining and interesting from start to finish and I think it deserves all the praise it gets.  It's definitely not a perfect show, but that's not really saying much when talking subjectively.  In another time and place, the detractors of the show could have been its defenders.

The Kyoukai no Kanata entry confused me at first because I knew the series was a lot lower, and it's seem like the few fans that liked the series are the ones who voted high on the film...But with the exception of that (can't find another in a similar case), it seems like a good job with the listing. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for others, but the film is probably higher because it provided a satisfying ending, which the original series was seriously lacking.
>> ARTICLE
When you say you combined series, do you mean you averaged the scores or did you just take the highest ranked entry in the series? It looks like you did the latter, but that can be pretty misleading since later entries in series almost always receive higher scores due to people who disliked the original not bothering to continue.
>> ARTICLE
The list is intended to be relatively useful, not an absolute ranking.  It helps to remove half the list because of duplicates / semi-duplicates.  I know whenever I looked at MAL for "top x" in order to check out stuff I may watch, I've always been super annoyed that I have to scroll down pages to avoid Gintama repeats, etc.
>> ARTICLE
True, but I think there can be problems with either approach: there are franchises where the first one or more installments are well-received and then things go downhill. Kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't...
>> ARTICLE
I did the latter. I'll probably make another one that averages as well in a week or two. There is a problem with both options though. Due to the rating that MAL ratings work, long running shows like Hunter x Hunter or One Piece only have the ratings of people who have seen most of the show are counted. I'll probably be making more of this with different methods to try and get a more general idea in the future.

So far I'm thinking of making top 100 lists that:

1. Average everything
2. Only includes the initial/first aired season
3. Only includes the most recent season

>> ARTICLE
Oh, I didn't know that long runners only counted ratings from people who've watched most of the show. No wonder so many of them end so on high on MAL. That'd complicate this kind of ranking even more.
>> ARTICLE
1/100

Do I have bad taste? No.. No. It's everyone else who's wrong.
>> ARTICLE
If I ~~have enough time~~ stop being lazy I could make one which takes the averages of each entry and its sequels/whatevers.

Wow, is FMA:B really that good? Why have I delayed watching it for so long???

What I really enjoyed, is that it's a longer show that really pays off in the end (character development etc...). And its a pretty wild journey (I knew nothing going into the show).
>> ARTICLE
All anime is subjective just like movies and any other medium.  Honestly, I found it to be good, but not amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was a gateway anime for many, so that could be a factor. To me it just seemed like an above-average shounen battle show, but I don't generally enjoy that genre so I didn't care for it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely wasn't a gateway series for me, but I'm a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I felt FMA:B to be equally good, or better. I wouldn't call it a battle shounen, but I would call it a family adventure show. Pretty much just Avatar.

I don't know if it's harder to accept mediocre shows being so highly rated or great shows barely making the list.

from the top 100 any romance/harem  in there?

Ouran High School Host Club is the only harem anime in there.

Romance has a lot. Clannad:After Story, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Ruroni Kenshin, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, the Monogatari Series, Bakuman, Howl's Moving Castle, Kara no Kyoukai, Hotarubi no Mori e, The Tatami Galxy, Major, Nana, Cross Game, Nodame Cantabile, Romeo no Aoi Sora, Sakamachi no Apollon, The Girl who Leapt through Time, Toradora, Spice and Wolf, Tsubasa, Ouran High School Host Club, Sakurasou, Rose of Versailles, Welcome to the NHK, and Honey and Clover.
>> ARTICLE
thanks for that, ,gonna check them 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is also a harem, even if mal doesnt say so (at least by defenition).
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari and Clannad (first season) are technically harem anime, they just aren't labelled as such by MAL for whatever reason.
>> ARTICLE
You missed Kyoukai no Kanata in your list - very strong romance subplot in that one, overwhelming the action/youmu stuff really.

>  Ruroni Kenshin

Is that really considered a "Romance"?  I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a *small* subplot IIRC.  Though I only watched through the Shishio arc so dunno if it gets more emphasis later on, but from what I recall the romance aspect wasn't much stronger than Naruto's.

Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance, but I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series since they are 1000% different in just about everything.
>> ARTICLE
> Is that really considered a "Romance"? I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a small subplot IIRC.

Nope it is not, RK cannot be considered a romance anime. It might involve romance in it (which it doesn't really btw but that's another topic) but RK is not a "romance anime" as the focus is completely different.

> Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance
It had more but even then it is still minimal considering the story in general. The things it focuses on is much more different. 

> I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series

OP made some huge mistakes in the list. Some shows still have more than one entry with different adaptations and movies like Fate/s Evangelion but made some omitting with others. I understand that he merged 3 seasons of the Gintama and Benizakura movie was a recap but why add Final Chapter as well. RK suffers from this the most because the movies and the original series are too far away from each other many people wouldn't believe they are the parts of the same series. '96 TV series of Rurouni Kenshin and Star Wars are more similar to each other than   original series and Trust&Betrayal OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
Mind you, Ouran is a reverse harem. A great one, and really funny, but the MC is still a girl, which will probably put some people off.

Ouran is like one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen. it's very good to pass the time and be relaxed while laughing your ass off

In case anyone is reading this, hasn't seen it, and thinks they might be put off by the reverse harem bit: try it anyway. Please. It's a good fucking show.

Well, I greatly enjoyed both the manga and anime, like I said it's great, but some people will(sadly) be put off by the fact that it's a reverse harem, even though it's nothing like say Diabolik lovers or Dance with Devils. I can recommend it to everyone.

Great effort, thanks! 

Have watched about half of the list.

i need to watch more high rated shows.

What's interesting about a consolidated lost like this is that the upward push of Eva 2.22 (which was highly received by fans) carried all the Rebuilds 47 spots ahead of the original series.

Obviously the original show is > than the Rebuilds but it's interesting to see how a superior movie/episode in a set of OVAs can influence the whole.

Anyway--great job on the list, OP this helps me know more of a real top 100 I can pick and watch from!
>> ARTICLE
Well that's because the OP just congregates EVERY spinoff and sequels and prequels while compiling the list. He did NOT average scores. As someone else said, franchises with multiple seasons that people would have dropped cause they didn't like the first ones are bound NOT TO watch and berate the latter ones. That's how you get Aria who's only got one really high rated season (Origination) while the rest were 8/10 or lower. That makes this list a bit misleading.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Haikyuu at 12

I've seen like 10 of those, lmao. I've got only about other 15 on my PTW too. TIL I'm an anime hipster I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Well, there are so many more shows I like outside of top100 than within it. Polarizing shows are not neccessarily bad, but get mediocre scoring by definition. Long-running shows also have a higher scores because only fans stick to watching it. And just as newer shows start off with high ratings, that decay over time, really old shows are rated higher than they are worth because of nostalgia. I would most definitely rate DBZ higher than if I would watch it now for the first time. I think most people don't really take the top100 seriously.
>> ARTICLE
34/100. It's sad to look at this and realize some amazing anime aren't on the list while some really bad ones are. A good example would be that Haibane Renmei is not on the list while it's much inferior rip-off, Angel Beats is...

It also lacks Berserk, the original FMA, GiTS movie, Princess Tutu...

in the end it just comes down to taste :/

Well, the manga is SUPER popular. Haven't found the time to watch the anime yet, but the story is really good if you enjoy HxH, One Piece and shounens like that.

I was the same but I started watching again and finished it all in one go pretty much, it does get better but I am still disappointed i nsome stuff.

The anime is basically a generic action shounen, but it is *very good* for an action shounen, comparatively.  The pacing, action, characters are all fairly tight.  I'd rate it among the top 5 generic action shounen quite easily.

34/100. I dropped about an additional 5 shows from this list on top of that though.
A lot of these titles feel very over inflated with their list placement due to sheer popularity. Your Lie in April seems like the most overrated anime of the past few years to me; it wasn't bad though. I'm happy OPM is pretty high on the list. I don't know if it deserves top 10 but it's definitely had an impact on the anime medium. Probably for the better.

Why can't we do that? I mean when I want to put a series in my PTW, it would be cool to like put the whole series in it, not just the first season, everything, OVAs, films, extra episodes everything, together with an watch order if possible. It would be a whole lot simplier to sort through my list of 4 different fate seasons/films/OVAs or whatever, not to mention you don't miss an OVA or film when you were looking for an series to watch because you didn't see the others adaptions/sequels tab in the info page.

I think this will need a redo once current season hype dies down. Noragami, Shokugeki no Souma and OPM have inflated scores, and will take a couple months to settle.

for the curious, check out legend of the galactic heroes. it's a very good scifi anime. it's dialogue heavy with a lot of political intrigue, but there's enough action to satisfy. if i were to compare it to a live action show, i'd say it's like a grittier battlestar galactica.

"6- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988)"

Any advice about this anime? is it worth? is it better than newer shows? or maybe its just more nostalgic points.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very talky space opera. It's by no means perfect: the animation is often quite limited and sometimes error prone (both problems are most common near the show's beginning), for example, and the animation and direction don't always convey the scale and details of the battles that well. And leaving aside actual problems, it's not something which everyone would enjoy watching. As I said, it's talkative, plus it's very sincere and not terribly interested in being hard science fiction.

That said... if you do have any appreciation at all for space operas, or dialogue-driven political/military stories, it's worth a shot because it is very satisfying to watch. It's unique in anime for the size of its cast and kind of unique for the ambition of its storythere are longer anime, but there aren't many which can do 110 episodes of continuous epic narrative with no filler. It's pleasingly capacious in its ideas: it doesn't necessarily get very incisive about any one ideology or behaviour but it includes so many ideas and arguments and incidents. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is certainly 'better than newer shows' in the sense that nothing since has done, or has even really been able to attempt to do, the kinds of things that it does.

So I'd say it's worth giving it a try if it interests you, though you shouldn't feel obliged to watch it and if you do try it and dislike it that's fine.

> nostalgic points

This is unlikely, because the show was only made widely available with an English translation in the mid to late 2000s. I'd bet that a substantial majority of the people on MAL who've seen it saw it within the last decade. From my memory it was almost unknown among English-speaking fans until 2007 or 2008, when it gradually took off.

There is a clear(and unsurprising to me) recency bias. It also seems several genres are more in the list than others, i.e. shonen, romance, supernatural and action, whereas harem seems underpresented(Monogatari and Ouran?). Theres also a distinct lack of cute girls doing cute things - anime

Great work OP

Demographic bias.

fucking Katekyo Hitman Reborn? seriously? jesus people, i don't really like some of this show but i get why they're so popular, but reborn? that's just wrong, it had a good premise and the first couple arc were good, but after that it became just complete trash, its one of the most generic, repetitive, stereotyped, poorly written shonen i've ever seen

i just don't get it


>> ARTICLE
Well you obviously won't agree but what I loved about it was that it was just a fun show. The characters were fun, the action was fun, the plot was fun, etc. Characters like Gokudera, Lambo, Hibari, Squalo...they really did do a great job of making them feel like a family. I started to love the characters so much that I didn't even mind the "daily life" episodes and began to miss them a bit

Plus it was amazingly creative. Small touches like the ten-year bazooka added so much flavor to the show for me. Not to mention the abilities that each character had and some of the really spectacular fight scenes (Yamamoto vs Squalo, Gokudera vs Gamma, Hibari vs Genkishi, Tsuna vs Xanxus, etc)

I won't deny that the show has more than its fair share of problems (sexism, Tsuna constantly realizing his resolve comes from protecting his friends, filler arcs) but it is pretty special to me 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm ... KHR was pretty generic as a shounen but it went beyond generic a bit with the expansion of its scope through the middle of the series.  So, I felt it "ramped up" then stayed in good, high gear all the way until the very end where they rushed the last few episodes pretty hard.

At the end of the day it still remains a "shounen+" to me, so nothing super outstanding, but I rate is as definitely a step above average and "100"th place isn't really overrating it, IMO.

Shirobako, the first episode or 2 didn't really hold my interest at first.  So I had stopped watching, picked it up again after it fully aired and marathoned the entire thing.

I just watched it to compare with Bakuman. I didn't expect uch but that was more entertaining than I thought.

Bakuman is better but Shirobako is something else.

Yeah, I put it on hold around episode 4 because I found it a bit slow. Kept seeing how great it was all over the subreddit and picked it up again around episode 20-21. Marathoning it was much easier and I really enjoyed it, plus I was up to date for the last couple episodes.

I had to drop it when it was airing. College was stressing me out and I couldn't bare to watch an anime (which was my escape from the stress) about people desperately trying to meet deadlines. I need to watch it at some point. I'll probably watch with my mom sometime this year.

Chihayafuru. I actually dropped the show months ago at episode 2 before it got out of the kids arc (which in retrospect is fine, but wasn't what I was looking for).

Kill la Kill. The promos and advertisements didn't really catch my attention and Ryuko's uniform design didn't really interest me. Then I decided to watch an episode cause I heard good things here. Ended up binging all 13 episodes out at the time and joined the hype train. 
>> ARTICLE
I had the exact opposite experience with *KlK.*  I thought the premise sounded pretty cool, since I normally have a strong love of revenge stories, but I found the show pretty much unwatchable.  I tried on three separate occasions - separated by months each time - and it's all I could do to watch two episodes.  I thought it was ridiculous and it didn't hold my interest. 
>> ARTICLE
You definitely have to be looking for that ridiculousness. I knew nothing about it at all, but I was bored and people kept mentioning it, so I three it on, and I was instantly hooked by the over the top nature of it all. It's just fucking nuts, and that kind of thing appeals to me.

Some people have moods for that kind of thing. If you're ever explicitly looking for something crazy and/or bananas, I'd say that's the time to give it a go!

Black Lagoon, before I got back into Anime I had seen the scene of the Twins from S2 when I clicked on Toonami randomly one time where the one "Female" twin is on the Lagoon with Rock. Shit made me go wtf hard and made me heavily biased against it.  
  
Friend from work encouraged me to watch it much to my resistance, finally ended up doing so and I'm extremely happy I did. However nothing fazes me now, the Twins is but a minor footnote in all things that could be considered "Wtf" in my anime career, and I wouldn't give it up for anyone, not even my waifu.

I could go with the easy answer and say I despised Nagi no Asukara at first, before character development made it a show I loved.

But, to go with a show I wasn't sure of at first, I'd have to say Log Horizon. When it started, I thought it was nothing but an SAO rip-off (and I wasn't exactly fond of SAO). I wasn't expecting much. It wasn't until the second arc, about 7-8 episodes in, that I really started to like it. That second arc, along with the even better arc after it, really made me love the show.

I didn't think I'd like fate as much as I did. Honestly, I played the fate route of the visual novel first, and I have to say, while it was 'okay', Emiya was pretty fucking insufferable for me. Still, the Unlimited Blade Works anime made up for that. Emiya is more likeable in my eyes, and the animation is some of the most gorgeous I've ever seen, especially the fights.

Can't wait to play Heaven's feel, starting later this week.
>> ARTICLE
> Emiya is more likeable

First time I've heard this. Usually it's the opposite as the anime cuts out a lot of his inner thoughts and make hims seem more dumb. Personally I've never had a problem with him. Haven fun with HF. My favorite route as well as many others. 
>> ARTICLE
I *really* didn't like Shirou in the fate route. He was so unreasonable for about 4/5ths of the game. The change in focus in UBW didn't really give Shirou a chance to whine as much.

>Have fun with HF. My favorite route as well as many others.

Good to know, I've heard it's the longest. I'll probably take a couple weeks to get through it, but I definitely think I'll enjoy it if it's at least as good as UBW.

A lot of things actually. Many of my favorite series, to begin with. One Piece I started on a whim, and a friend had been into it for a while but didn't say much about it. I decided to watch an episode here or there one night and I soon found myself hooked.

Gintama was one that took me a while, I was sorta lollygagging through the series for like 40 or 50 episodes, relatively enjoying it as a nice way to relax after school. Once it hit Benizakura though, I was completely pulled in. As you can see by my username, it has had quite the effect, and is probably my favorite anime/manga/any media series I've seen to date.

Gundam I sort of started watching ironically, as dumb as that sounds. I figured I'd give the 0079 movies a run after seeing 08th MS Team, thinking that if it was bad I'd be able to laugh at the poor quality. I was extremely surprised by how in depth the series was, and how it was more Star Trek than Star Wars for the most part. The characters were the best part, so much depth in them, no matter how many decisions they may make they still felt very well written.

Rosario + Vampire

First few episodes of Valvrave had me disapointed. It was so stupid.

Eventually I got the vibe that it was just batshit crazy and I really got into it.
>> ARTICLE
Sora no Otoshimono. Thought it would be another boring harem. I found out its one of the best comedies I've ever seen. And then the manga that wasn't adapted was just stellar.
>> ARTICLE
Your lie in April. I usually am never a fan of romances much(well, the Hollywood ones) and nothing 'sad' prior to watching the show ever made me cry. Like, the closest I came was watching Hachiko but that's about it.

Oh fuck the feels trip in this show was absurd.
>> ARTICLE
Prison School. I was never a fan of ecchi (I could not stand DxD or Monster Musume) but PS changed all that. Also, the series had a great story, hilarious characters, and intense moments. 
>> ARTICLE
**One Punch Man**

Believe me or not, when I tried watching it, I thought it was boring and random, only a guy stupidly overpowered killing monsters that make no sense. I ended up dropping in the first episode right about before Saitama started attacking that huge monster.

Recently I picked it up again and it ended up as my favorite show.

10/10

If **Gintama** really is as good as others are saying, the same thing will happen with it too when I end up trying to watch it again

Twelve kingdoms. Youko was just so whiny at the beginning. I get. That it was realistic but it was there is only so much angst I can take
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko no Basket. I should say I wasn't really unsure about it, but the only reason I decided to watch it was because I read that it was going to be used in a Gintama reference, so to get the reference whenever I got to that episode, I had to watch KnB. I came into it with absolutely 0 expectations, and I think that's part of what made me love the series so much.
>> ARTICLE
Not a series but a movie.

Frozen. I didn't want to watch because it was aimed for kids (especially little girls) but because of the hype, I wanted to know why it is so popular.

You know what? It's my favorite Disney movie now! Let it go, can't hold it back anymore!!
>> ARTICLE
Mahouka I thought was extremely dry and boring at first. I thought it was really dumb how they would spend a whole minute explaining magic but I was really curious about the world so I kept watching.

After a while the magic concepts starting making more sense to me and now it's one of my all-time favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Guilty Crown. I just found it somewhere when I was looking for something to watch, and had no expectations whatsoever. I ended up really loving it.
>> ARTICLE
Wagnaria

End of the first episode left a bad taste in my mouth, as characters like that really annoy me, so I dropped it. But, lots of people continued to recommend it, so I tried again with the goal if ignoring that aspect, and I'm glad I did. Seasons 2 and 3 were especially great.
>> ARTICLE
Suzumiya Haruhi for me.

I watched in [chronological order](http://i.imgur.com/CMaAuPB.png) and after the first 2 episodes, I considered putting it on hold or dropping it but I'm glad I didn't! Disappearance especially became one of my all-time favorites

>comic

 They refer to it as manga in the article but by god if they didn't use the word comic in the title just to avoid scaring people away. The one, yes, one time it's referred to as a comic is the one time it's important in the body of context. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd rather try to get people into this collab that has such a cool meaning and inspiration behind it. Nothing wrong with that. And there's nothing but manga drawings on the details of the shoes and boxes. Not like they are exactly hiding it.
>> ARTICLE
[Looks like they'll be priced at $185-250](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/launch/2014-10/jordan-x-slam-dunk-collection)
>> ARTICLE
Probably 185 for the Super Fly 3s, and 250 for the 6s.
>> ARTICLE
Seems pretty cool. Only got into basketball fairly recently, so slightly interested, so far away though.
>> ARTICLE
Don't use them to play in. I mean they're probably going to be expensive as shit, when I played in high school I went through 2 pairs of shoes in just 1 season. That's on a court too, on concrete I'm sure they'd die much faster. They definitely look cool though.
>> ARTICLE
I figured that would sort of be the case. The shoes I bought during the summer already have a lot of wear and tear on them, but they were just regular store bball shoes so I hoped better ones would stay nicer longer, I'd feel so cool playing in them!

Given that you're saying you went through 2 pairs in a season, it probably wasn't to keep them nice and clean that you swapped them. As a newbie, what specifically breaks/ tears usually for you to need to stop using them?
>> ARTICLE
The grip just wears out and it makes your stops harder to do. That's all bball shoes are, shoes that have a better grip than other ones. When the bottom wears out its good to replace them. Depending on your position and if you play street ball or on court they can wear faster than normal. 
>> ARTICLE
That makes sense! I just looked down at my shoes (I only use 1 pair of shoes.) and the top of my right foot's grip is gone. I didn't realize that grip disappears so quickly.
>> ARTICLE
For me it was where my big toe connected to my foot. Idk the area of what it's called, but that's the area. It's because I stop/pivot on that area. 
>> ARTICLE
These seem more for Sneaker heads. If you liked them enough to play they still are a shoe. If I had that inclination though I'd buy a second pair. One to ball in that would eventually die and another to swag out in.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely what they are for. I might buy a pair if they aren't ridiculously priced. They look amazing, same for the box they come in too. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I would put these on an upper tier than normal ones 150-200 range. I wouldn't tag anything that high but it is more of a collectible than any other shoe coming out right now.
>> ARTICLE
These are dope. 


Eyeshield cleats would be cool too if it was art from the manga and not the series. 
>> ARTICLE
What we need is a new Eyeshield anime. Then shoes.

I like the red ones.

Wow nice! I am a big fan! My favourite sport anime ever!

I hope i can save up and buy this. It looks so cool..

See these are stuff worth collecting. Jordan 6 Slamdunk themed shoes.

Cant wait for Adidas to make Kuroko no Basket shoes in response.

Someone else on another sneaker website posted this exact same thing, and got called out for being a weeaboo. Are you this person?
>> ARTICLE
I am not. But I watch anime and know about Nike + Adidas
>> ARTICLE
Meh, Adidas makes a new shoe using exactly last years looks and technology. At least JB retros are retros, meant to stay true to an original shoe in history.
>> ARTICLE
holy shiet... im throwing my wallet at my screen... but nothin's happening.
>> ARTICLE
I don't play basketball but I need one.
>> ARTICLE
Im not into the whole J's scene but i think its pretty cool of Nike to do it. 
>> ARTICLE
My god it's times like these I wish college didn't suck my wallet dry. These are fire, but let's be honest these will be so much in another 6 years when I'm actually making my own money. I'll still pay for em though lol. The shirts/cap make this collab even sicker. Also Slam Dunk got this collab because the writer was inspired by Jordan, and in the manga there are references, and even a shoe that looks like a Jordan 6 is in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Those 6's are so clean <3. When is the release?
>> ARTICLE
Today for Sydney. Couldn't cop my 6s, damn you Footlocker and your raffle system!

I really want the 6s, I haven't been this hyped for a release in a long time.

1. Bakemonogatari : for the constantly shifting art and the perfect banter between all the characters. Also Ren'ai Circulation.
2. Kara no Kyoukai : for the mystery, music and fluid animation.
3. Nichijou : I've never laughed so hard at any other anime before.
4. Stein;s Gate : For making me love the characters and fantastic voice acting. Okabe espescially.
5. FMA: Brotherhood : 50 episodes of pure plot, how often do you see that?
6. Madoka : Because I didn't expect it.
7. Lucky Star! : I'm not sure why I love this one so much but i've watched it 3 times now. I regret nothing.
8. Angel Beats! : ROCKET CHAIRS
9. Gundam Seed : Despite a terribly low budget and reusing explosions, everytime I watch it I get pulled into Kira/Athrun's story.
10. Darker than Black : for the chinese electric batman and because I have no idea what's going on.

Gurren Lagann was amazing, don't get me wrong. And before I watched 5-8, Gurren Lagann was up there. But it's all about over-the-top-ness and overcoming odds. And, while I love that, I love Ryohgo Narita that much more. Plus there's not Izaya and Shizuo in Gurren Lagann.

What is with the incredible lack of GitS?

I have the Stand Alone Complex box set, it's a good series but honestly it just didn't captivate me the way the others on my top 10 list did.  I've felt the same as Spike, as Vash, as Kamina etc but no character in GitS made me feel like I was a part of the show.  Maybe that's a lot to ask though, good series but IMHO not a great series.

>> ARTICLE
Saw this a while back on reddit.. somewhat relevant... NSFW http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdY7NMWhLc&feature=related 
>> ARTICLE
It's because it's so simple, yet so complex. At first glance, all the characters seem to be pure archetypes; boring, one-dimensional, cliche. Once you get inside their heads, though, they become incredibly interesting. It's a character-driven action series, which is extremely rare in a world where 99% of action movies/shows are purely event-driven.
>> ARTICLE
Because it's epic as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
I can respect that
>> ARTICLE
Well, to be honest, I'm a fan of the manga more than the anime but that's mainly because the manga has much more content.
>> ARTICLE
I don't love Berserk that much. /sarcasm
>> ARTICLE
Brilliant story, pure and simple. Never seen anything like it.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's mainly because it's a well written story with characters that just bursts in colours in terms of personality.  Also there's not much westernized Fantasy that's as well realized as the Berserk backstory in Japanese anime/manga history (IMHO and AFAIK anyways), so fans of the genre really digs it.

In addition it is one of the few animes that while not being better than it's manga counter part can certainly stand toe to toe on it's own.

When Bleach is good, it's one the most intensely thrilling shows on television (think: Ichigo's battle with Kenpachi).  But when Bleach is bad, it's borderline unwatchable (think: fillers and the whole bountu arc).

The bountou arc was filler.

Actually kinda hard to think of 10 that have really stuck out to me. I'm fairly picky when it comes to anime, don't usually like comedies, romances (exception being Shakugan no Shana), or harem anime at all.

Honorable mention to Durarara.



>> ARTICLE
Sometimes it seems like you, me, and three other guys enjoyed Blood+.
>> ARTICLE
I preferred the movie - especially the live action movie, but the show was still good.
>> ARTICLE
I can see why people don't like it, it's slow to get good and longer than it needed to be. But damnit that end scene where [Saya is about to kill the two babies and Hagi goes against her and tells her no](/spoiler) Brings a tear to my eye every time :(
>> ARTICLE
The show failed to live up the its amazing concept, but it was entertaining nonetheless. I can't wait for Blood C, or whatever they're calling it.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was a decent show, I definitely enjoyed it at the time, I just didn't feel it really impacted me. Fun little adventure, and Saya was a worthy protagonist. 
>> ARTICLE
Blood + is certainly top 10 for me, I was a late adopter and that is the show that brought me, full force, in to watching anime regularly.
>> ARTICLE
BLOOD-C has been out and actually last episode just aired.

I watched the first ep and put it on hold. I hope its awesome.

Well personally I thought it was not as terrible as Blood+. At least it was only 12 episodes of worthlessness vs 50.

Outlaw Star was the anime that hooked me. M.o.H.S is just brilliantly done. Chrono Crusade has always been one of my favorites because of the darkness/comedy.

I listed whatever has rewatch value for me. For nostalgia I wanted to include Sailormoon, but I really didn't like the prolonged monster of the week approach.

Thanks for asking us to list out our Top 10. I've been feeling lost lately as to what to watch and after seeing everyone's lists I think Stein;s Gate should be enjoyable.

Usagi Drop would be a great anime to get your girlfriend interested. It's basically a slice of life about a guy who takes in his 6 year old aunt and learns to raise a child by himself. Its an awesome, non-ecchi, and captivating story.

10's not really enough, There are a couple of other genre's I could pull from, and list isn't really by order of like the most, I could probably just as easily expand this list to 20 or so that fit different moods.

edit: Juuni Kokuki not Kokkori, my own stupid misspelling of it =)
>> ARTICLE
> 1. Seikai no Senkai Series

Thank you.  Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one out there who loves that series.

>> ARTICLE
Have a upvote for katanagatari and Juuni Kokuki.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why or when, but for some reason the title got stuck in my head as kokkori, I always go back and correct it, or do it midway through, but it never seems to stick ._.

upvote for digimon

which season? or all of them?
>> ARTICLE
The first three were good, in my opinion. It went down hill when they started to become Digimon themselves. That's when I stopped.
>> ARTICLE
>when they started to become Digimon themselves.

Wait, what? As someone who grew up on season one, and watched a bit of season two, this...I don't even know what to think of this. I guess not watching further was for the best.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I grew up with 1 also. I watched to 3 because of new characters and a new plot/element. Then 4 started.  [If you're curious, here's episode 1.](http://www.youtube.com/user/dreedman16x2#p/c/6618191C3A75A55F/0/vpSIQXldheI) I did enjoy the main theme though. I'll give it that much.

This is gonna show how lacking my exposure to anime is...
And these are in no particular order

1. Full Metal Alchemist
2. Dragon Ball
3. Dragon Ball Z
4. Negima!
5. Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple
6. Cowboy Bebop
7. Please Teacher
8. Hellsing

And.....that's all I've seen. Sad right? I'd love some recommendations.
>> ARTICLE
Check out Full Metal Alchemist: **Brotherhood**, Hajime no Ippo, Hunter X Hunter, Trigun and Gungrave. 

If you're interested in something really awesome and epic One Piece might be up your alley, it's one of those anime that you either love or hate. If you like it you will have lots of entertainment ahead of you. :)

>> ARTICLE
I've heard many good things about One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
It's amazing.
>> ARTICLE

Full Metal Alchemist - (Watch FMA: Brotherhood)

Dragon Ball  & Dragon Ball Z - (Watch Soul Eater, Berserk, Fairy Tail, Claymore, S-cry-ed, Darker Than Black)

Negima! (I haven't watched this. Looks similar to Clannad, Clannad After Story, Ouran High School Host Club, Cromartie High School. First two are slice of life, second two are comedies)

Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple (See recs for DBZ. Also HunterxHunter, Law of Ueki)

Cowboy Bebop (Samurai Champloo, Baccano!)

Please Teacher (Haven't seen this. Birdy the Mighty: Decode, maybe?)

Hellsing (Trinity Blood, Blood+)

EDIT: General recs: Madoka, Kino's Journey, Serial Experiments Lain

Look everything up on Myanimelist.net
>> ARTICLE
the first season of Birdy is good, the second not so much

>> ARTICLE
I did not enjoy Trinity Blood, at all. In fact I almost slept through many episodes. I can vouch for Blood+ though!
>> ARTICLE
These threads are a great way to get into new anime. Look for someone who shares some of your top ten choices, and check out the other series on their list.

Also, if you liked Cowboy Bebop, you'll love Black Lagoon.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I'll make a list :)
>> ARTICLE
Good thread to go through the entire thread, grab everyone top 1 or 3, put it in a list, watch 2-3 episodes of said series, and if you like it, keep going, if not, move to the next one on the list - someone in here will have taste similar to yours =p. Probably.
>> ARTICLE
Not a bad idea, thanks.

This is just out of the top of my head, so I may regret not mentioning some Anime. I will try to name at least one from each genre/type, and in some cases, what other animus of the same type I liked. I don't think it would be fair to name 10 Anime series of different genres, because it would be very hard to compare them.

Seinen: Berserk

Sci-fi: Crest of the Stars (runner up: Ghost in the Shell, Darker than Black)

Comedy: Arakawa Under the Bridge (runners up: Ranma 1/2, Golden Boy, Green Green, GTO, Detroit Metal City)

Drama: Nana (runners up: Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien, Honey and Clover) - Nana wins because  [it had anal sex](/spoiler) ;) (I'm kidding of course, not about the [sex](/spoiler) though)

Fantasy: Twelve Kingdoms (runners up: Wolf's Rain, Katanagatari, Bakemonogatari, Last Exile and Bounen no Xamdo)

Romance: Rurouni Kenshin Tsuioku Hen (runners up: Ouran Host Club and Crest of the Stars [once again]) - although there is a lot of action on this one, it tells one of the most beautiful and bittersweet love stories I have ever seen on an animated series. It moved me more than any of the other ones mentioned, that's why it's my favorite.

Shounen: Hunter X Hunter (runners up: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Naruto [the first seasons up until the end of the main first arc], Bleach [first two seasons], Katekyou Hitman Reborn, Rurouni Kenshin Anime and last but certainly not least, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann)

Sports: Hajime no Ippo! (runners up: Cross Game, Initial D [not really a sport, I know, but I will enjoyed it greatly. Don't recommend it to everyone though])

Music: Beck (runner up: K-ON)
>> ARTICLE
wow, nicely done with the compilation and FINALLY Wolf's Rain shows up in someone else list! 
>> ARTICLE
1. One Piece
2. Black Lagoon
3. Baccano! (Best dub I have ever heard, by a wide margin)
4. Fullmetal Alchemist (original)
5. Neon Genesis Evangelion
6. Samurai Champloo
7. Spice and Wolf
8. Dragonball
9. DBZ (Probably wouldn't like it that much now, but my god, the memories)
10. Cowboy Bebop (Really need to watch this again. I bet it would be higher on my list if I did. I know I like Samurai Champloo more than it though, which puts me in a small minority.)

Honorable mention to 08th MS Team, which I really need to see in Japanese, because I tried to watch it again and realized that the English voices were godawful. Also, if the Adult Swim Shin Chan dub counts as an anime, then it's near the top.

I would put Toradora if ony had space.
(Not in order)



>> ARTICLE
Ah you have some of my favorites that haven't been mentioned much; Kaichou wa Maid-sama and Skip Beat! Absolutely loved them! I think Ouran High School Host Club would be in my top 10 too. 
>> ARTICLE
No order, because ordered lists are for chumps:

Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Tiger & Bunny, Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell, Detroit Metal City,  Gundam, GaoGaiGar, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei

Right on the money. Count from 0 haha :)
>> ARTICLE
So, skimming over, it seems like the subreddit is fairly action-oriented?
>> ARTICLE
I think if you take a random sample then in general shounen /action anime is always going to be the most popular - it has general themes most of us will enjoy or tolerate, and is set to appeal to the widest audiences. Same reasons Naruto/Bleach/One Piece last so long with such large audiences. =)
>> ARTICLE
Very hard to compile this list, but I did the best I could. 

1. Toradora!
2. Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Boku-tachi wa Mada Shiranai
3. Welcome to the N.H.K!
4. Code Geass
5. Death Note
6. Hanasaku Iroha 
7. Hikaru no Go 
8. Baka to Test 
9. Fullmetal Alchemist (both)
10. Natsume Yuujinchou

Honorable Mention: Durarara!

>> ARTICLE
1. Slayers (including NEXT, TRY, Revolution, Evolution-R)
2. Lost Universe (guess what, it's a parallel universe to Slayers)
3. Saber Marionette J
4. Chrno/Chrono (whatever) Crusade
5. Ah! My Goddess
6. Eve no Jikan (6 eps long, you'll wish it were longer)
7. Noein (parallel universes and time travel, enjoy)
8. Haibane Renmei (what happens when you die?  let's find out!  By the creator of Lain!)
9. Serial Experiments Lain (prepare liberal amounts of mind lube)
10. DNA^2 (and if you can remember this series, you're definitely an anime kid of the 90s, bonus points if you downloaded and read the translated manga back then too)

And others that come to mind that I enjoyed: Record of Lodoss War (OVA),  Revolutionary Girl Utena, Martian Successor Nadesico, Neon Genesis Evangelion (to a point...ep 25&26 sucked ass), MS Gundam: 08th MS Team, Video Girl Ai (doh, DNA^2 and I don't even mention this one?).  I could go on - I haven't even mentioned some of the newer series I've been watching recently - Madoka is definitely one to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Hey! Another person who saw 08th MS Team!
>> ARTICLE
08th MS Team is my favorite of the entire franchise - it felt more realistic than the other Gundam series and it didn't take 52 or whatever episodes to tell the story.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, same here. It was really the only Gundam that I liked a lot. It was also significantly more mature than the other Gundams.

Not a single person mentions Fruits Basket... Of course it's not the greatest anime of all time but it's gotta be in the top ten.

these are personal top 10 lists, not the general consensus on what the definitive top 10 anime series are.

I've only watched about 50, but I'll throw out a list.

1. Cowboy Bebop (It's what started it all for me)
2. Full Metal Alchemist
3. Clannad After Story
4. High School of the Dead
5. Trigun
6. One Piece
7. Naruto Shippuden
8. Fruits Basket

10. Vandread/Bleach/Ouran High School Host Club(last/honorable mentions)

Desert Punk would have been in my top ten too, I just didn't like how it ended.  [Sure he was supposed to be the anti hero, but killing that family just because they saw him seemed too out of character](/spoiler)

8. Highschool of the Dead
9. Panty and Stocking w/ Garterbelt
10. Ghost in the Shell: SAC

The order is probably messed up somewhat, namely because it's such a varied list. Everything from the overly stylistic (TTGL and HotD), to outright parody, in PSG and Ichizon, to a more mature style (Cowboy Bebop, GitS, Black Lagoon), my favorite long-form Shounen (FMA:Brotherhood) and Angel Beats! and Steins;Gate, which at least to me are emotional roller coasters.

I always feel out of place looking at lists like this. I get the feeling a list of shows I didn't like would get more approval than what I did like given I was not a fan of Evangelion, TTGL, Code Geass, Haruhi, Welcome to the NHK or Ergo Proxy. Well, here goes nothing:

7. Voices of a Distant Star
8. Fruits Basket

Lots of honorable mentions: Wolf's Rain, Code Geass, Whisper of the Heart, Serial Experiments Lain, FLCL, Genshiken, all those weepy Key animes (original Kanon, Kanon, Air, and Clannad), Kimagure Orange Road (some great episodes but long length bogs it down), Toradora, and most of the other Miyazaki films.

I think my list does bias towards older work (or work I've seen longer ago) as its impact feels greater and more permanent. We'll see in a few years how sustained feelings are toward newer shows.

Edit: I'm sorry if I missed something, but why the downvotes? I thought r/anime was a polite subreddit where you can express opinions without (too much) hate. They asked for top 10, I gave top ten. Sorry if you don't agree with my choices.
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully y'all don't expect me to choose only 10. At best I was once able to get it down to 20 by only choosing stuff I would be excited to rewatch and then tossing items that were "too related." I couldn't come up with an order for them then and that's even worse now.

(To make matters worse, I added FMA:B bringing it up to 21 and The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is making me consider putting a 22nd on there.)

Meh, since removing the movies would only narrow it down to 17-18 (far bigger than the "top 10" idea) I'll just post it as-is:

* Ah! My Goddess! Movie

while i'm slightly embarrsed to admit it... i honestly love shows that bring me to tears... most of these shows have... Gintama has literally made me cry, it does it in a way that right after laughing till it hurts i'm suddenly tearing from a touching scene... imho best writing/diagologue out of all the Jump based anime. TTGL and CLannad are automatic well known best hits. Beck will alwayse have a special place in my  heart. i learned how to paly guitar during the english running of beck on Much Music. every week i'd watch and see both me and koyuki get progressively better and practicing till our fingers bled.  and it climaxed with the greatful sound concert...no other anime concert has given me that same feeling (Angel Beats! was close, the my song section was amazing, it didn't make the list because i felt it should have been longer, the small episode count didn't do the show justice)

Slam Dunk is incredible, never seen the Dub though

it's on par with Gundam Zeta dub.

Is that a good or a bad thing?

you decide

I can't since I've never heard the Gundam Zeta dub (or seen the sub for that matter)
>> ARTICLE
It's not all of Deltora Quest huh, pity. Oh well I've already watched it, still amuses me that an Australian fantasy novel series got an anime.

Edit: [Haha I forgot they used a Deltra Goodrem song with one of the Jap OPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQCJ5CSH9T8)
>> ARTICLE
I had no clue that Deltora Quest had an anime however I am Australian and I do remember reading the books in about grade 2, I might go watch it...
>> ARTICLE
Did the anime adapt all the books? Never knew it was actually a thing. 

Also the quality of that opening is amazing!  
>> ARTICLE
Like the other person said, they only did the first book series and that's where the dubbed episodes stop. The rest of the jap version was some filler stuff (also where that OP was used)
>> ARTICLE
Just the first 8 with some filler after the ending.
>> ARTICLE
They made an anime out of deltora quest? I gotta see that shit
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah Deltora Quest! Those books were the best when I was a kid. Definitely going to watch the anime one day.
>> ARTICLE
yay?  ive always wanted to watch Deltora Quest! lol
>> ARTICLE
Why is your excitement so confused?
>> ARTICLE
LOL what Deltora has an anime? I can't help but be skeptical about the quality.
>> ARTICLE
Its acctually pretty good. I mean its a bit kiddy but so were the books. The animation is on point though some of the action scenes feel kind of dated and not verry actiony. the Dub is ok, its not great but its not awful. 
>> ARTICLE
What? Since when was Deltora Quest an anime?
>> ARTICLE
Since like 2007
>> ARTICLE
Beyblade Metal Fusion? I didn't know that existed. 
>> ARTICLE
I sure hope it's the dub. Half the fun of watching that ridiculous mess is in watching it dubbed.
>> ARTICLE
crunchyroll has dubs?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, [37](http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-788825/crs-english-dubbed-anime) 
>> ARTICLE
Anime version wasn't really completed, or so I've heard, but you should still watch it. It was my childhood anime, along with Pokemon and DB. The animation of Slam Dunk is not bad, but the memorable things for me was the VA cast and the OST, especially the first OP and ED, it was just too nostalgic for me.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's basically what I got out of it hearing opinions a while back, that it stops at an odd spot. I'll definitely watch it at some point but I wanted to know if there was anything extra worthwhile involved.
>> ARTICLE
The manga has definitely aged better than the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Even though I watched a lot of InuYasha and Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as other old anime and I still enjoy them, Slam Dunk just seems old as fuck for me. I dunno, it just didn't age well. The manga is brilliant though. 
>> ARTICLE
It's my favorite anime of all time. It doesn't stop at an odd spot imo. It settles the central theme introduced in the beginning.  The manga ending just gives further closure and completeness.  While I love the animation, its not to everyone's taste.  My gf didn't like how "ugly" it is, but loved the personalities, the acting, and the soundtrack.  

The movies are originals.  They do give depth to Hanamichi and his teammates so I highly recommend them. They don't detract from the anime/manga at all imo. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually only watched slam dunk for the first time earlier this year, some of the humor and stuff is pretty cliche, but it's still a good show. The animation is -okay-, not really anything to write home about but it does the job, lets be honest the pull of slam dunk has always been the characters more than the basketball.

Didn't really end at an odd spot persay, but was definitely a bit inconclusive.
>> ARTICLE
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpTpm1SS2hU Oh, Revy...
>> ARTICLE
And this is why the Black Lagoon dub is superior.
>> ARTICLE
Seconding. There are two reasons for this:

Frist, Black Lagoon dub is more fitting to the plot, because most of the characters are supposed to be American. Even Revy lived long enough in America to have better english than portrayed in the original soundtrack.

Second, it's one of the better dubs, that exist.

Also, I'm neither Japanese nor from an English speaking country, so it doesn't really make a lot of difference for me either way, though I understand English much better than Japanese, I find myself listening more to the emotion of the sound, not to the actual words spoken when I'm reading a sub. Black Lagoon excels in that regard, especially regarding the tastefully done cursing, which is, frankly, impossible to do right in Japanese.

Haters gonna hate, I agree.

*shudder*

Oh god, I'm watching this series right now. Black Lagoon was the first thing I thought of and I haven't even gotten to that episode yet.

Every attempt in Kuroshitsuji. The anime is set in Victorian Europe and there are points in the story where people are speaking several sentences of engrish..along with the main characters catch phrase "yes, my lord", or affectionately, "yues, mi rordo"

I don't have a clip of this, but imagine a choir of Japanese folks with horrible engrish skirrls singing "God Save the Queen". 
>> ARTICLE
I never watched Kuroshitsuji, but that reminds me of Code Geass, with its "Yes, mai rordo" and "RONG RIVE BRITTANIA!"
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think you've tackled that one much better than me ^^

the character in Kuroshitsuji actually makes it seem kind of elegant.

>  I know there is more source material (novels, in this case), although I don't think it's entirely finished

Well, actually it is unfinished to the point there is not really much more to adapt. Particularly - AFAIR there is no novel with new adventures of Youko and her entourage, so [episode](/s "39") is basically end of their story also in the source material. And the whole LN series had been on hiatus for ~10 years.

You should continue with the manga if you haven't read it already. I watched and read Slam Dunk over the summer and it is not named "Japan's favourite manga" for no reason. 

But yeah, I don't think it will get a sequel. For the exact reasons already stated. I really enjoyed the anime, and it is an excellent adaption of the manga. However, the manga is brilliant on its own. I usually prefer anime over manga, but in Slam Dunk's case an adaptation of the last half would be nice to see exist but probably wouldn't do the manga justice. Takehiko Inoue is a genius mangaka, the paneling system for Slam Dunk is a masterpiece and I think anyone that has read Slam Dunk can easily see why I would say that. Also the art is excellent.

I highly doubt it...it was made in the 90's, also there's really no reason considering the Manga is also finished.

They brought Hajime no Ippo back, I really hope they at least do a OVA or something. :(
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo is an ongoing manga. Slam Dunk is a completed manga. One of the main factors into whether or not an anime adaption is made is whether or not the source material is ongoing. Anime's primary purpose is to sell the source material. It isn't considered profitable to continue to push a completed series. (Especially one such as Slam Dunk that ended in 1996 according to wikipedia.)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. 
>> ARTICLE
Could you explain things like *Toradora* or *Mushishi*, then? The former was timed to end with the LN, which would be pointless if you simply wanted to advertise it. And the latter is getting a second season 5 years after the manga ended (although this one could be explained away as a passion project)
>> ARTICLE
Whenever you see cases like Mushishi, a big reason they get another adaptation is because of how devoted the director is to the work. In this case, I think Nagahama Hiroshi really had to pull some strings for Mushishi S2 and probably why it took so long to see it happen. And also because the Mushishi adaptation is probably one of the rare times when people would say that the anime is better than the manga so it deserves to be adapted and finished off. 
>> ARTICLE
Toradora would be considered ongoing still as it didn't end until March of 2009 with the anime ending at the same time. Despite how it was timed to end, it did not end until the anime ended as well. A series slated to end does not mean it is cancelled.

Mushishi I think is an outlier. Not all series follow the logic of getting adaptions. (TWGOK: Goddess Arc did not either considering it wasn't considered profitable and it did not look like it had any major affect on the sales of the manga.) If anything, I'd say Mushishi is popular enough to keep interest in the projects.

I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.

i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.

I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.

got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.

i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.

EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.

I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?

If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.

Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.

The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.

They didn't look terrible to me.

yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.

True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.

>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.

Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.

I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.

I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).

tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.

Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.

Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.

I had heard really great things about this anime and yes the art did turn me off at first but I figured hell there's that much raving about it then it would be worth checking out.  Well I dropped it 4 episodes into  the series.  I just couldn't get interested in it.  Sorry guys I tried. 
>> ARTICLE
You have to finish it to understand it's excellence. It's main focus is consious development of completely different characters, which you won't get from 4 episodes at all. It's only 7 more episodes, 2 and a half hour is not a big additional time investment so go for it.
Also the first four eps don't represent the rest of the show accurately, it changes and evolves a lot by the end and focuses less on the sport and more on the characters.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry if I can't get interested in an 11 episode series after watching a full third of it I have to say its just not for me.  There is way to much other content that I enjoy that I would rather fill those 2 and a half hours with.

I'm just saying that those 4 episodes don't reflect the rest of the series at all. It's about the payoff. Those couple of episodes are a lot better time investment than the whole series of Cross Ange or Aldnoah.Zero or most of this season for example.

The best TL;DR imo is that "it's not a sports anime but an anime about the characters who play ping pong and their motivations, dreams, and aspirations for doing so."

Definitely the AOTY for 2014, excluding HxH (2011), and a must watch for anyone who's interested in some of the best character development I've ever seen. The intro to the OP is also the most hype thing I've ever heard and always got me excited to watch it each week when it was airing! 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is one of my favorite anime, it did almost everything right.

Every character is amazing and the actual ping pong games are very nicely animated and intense. Characters' struggles and conclusions were executed so well that they actually made me cry(which happened with like 5 shows in total)

The opening is my second favorite OP ever, Hero Theme[[hype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohdLiyiY-Nw)] is probably the best track I've ever heard and the ED is one of the best as well. Overall the music is perfect

Only problem I had with it was Dragon's storyline which I found quite boring, I just didn't care. Also Wenge is objectively best boy.

That being said, I am not sure how much Ping Pong deserves a WT considering how new it is. Most people already know about it and how well received it is.

This is one of those shows that I think piling it into a genre is a disservice to it. This show is as much about ping pong as it is about competition between high schools (hint: it's not all about the sport). Like you said, ping pong is used as a plot device, more than anything.

This show is about the characters and how they grow and change, for better or for worse, around the sport of ping pong. The show could've been about golf, racquetball, or archery and the tone and the writing wouldn't; the only difference would be in the pacing of the story to accommodate for those sports.

Ping Pong The Animation is not a show about ping pong; it's a show about the journey and growth of its characters, which are ping pong players.
>> ARTICLE
It's a character drama, just happens to be about ping pong players
>> ARTICLE
Many sports anime are actually coming of age stories in disguise. Sounds like that's true for Ping Pong as well.
>> ARTICLE
There's more focus on character developments outside of games than the actual score keeping in matches, and we aren't talking about trainings and such, which gives that particular impression. It won't make new players pick up the sport, but will make ex players revisit that feeling again.
>> ARTICLE
But ping pong is used as a driving force behind the characters' motivations, right? From all the things I hear about ping pong it does sound like it condenses all the qualities that normal sports anime have but takes out that "shounen" aspect to it.
>> ARTICLE
That'd be the best TL;DR for what I meant to say, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Character Development: The Animation has definitely been THE show that needed a "Watch This!" thread.
>> ARTICLE
Unique art styles like this make it easier to watch a show for me, not harder. Is it really that big of a turnoff for some people that you have to defend it? It's should be one of the selling points.

> Is it really that big of a turnoff for some people that you have to defend it.

Yes.  I think it's due to people wanting more "style" than actual substance.
>> ARTICLE
There's no reason not to add style onto substance.  That's an absurd concept you're suggesting.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I made it clear enough.  I meant that people value style more than actual substance.

I think people value style and substance, both in great measure, and Ping Pong intentionally goes on a detour on the style column.

Hey Zudsi (  )
>> ARTICLE
personally not my type of anime, in fact i dropped it after 4. Just couldn't get into it for reasons.. but i can see why others like it. 
>> ARTICLE
I getcha. It's a very strange show, and personally it's the reason why I love it. But it can definitely be very polarizing.
>> ARTICLE
That's a weird time to drop it. I feel like episodes 1-4 specifically were kind of a prelude to the actual plot. I'd give it one more episode before deciding on dropping it. I can understand if you still don't like it though. It can be hard for some people to get into.
>> ARTICLE
it may seem like an off place to stop, i agree, but it was like a number of factors for me that i decided to drop it.

1. **Hype**: picked it up in December when everyone and their mother is making a "Best Anime of 2014" list. Ping Pong was everywhere, everyone was jumping up and down screaming like it was a Capri-Sun commercial, that it was the best thing since slice bread. "It's So Different from everything else!" - for this 2014 i agree, but some of these opinions pretty much came from people that can't get into older animes "because they can't take the animation". So odd.
2. **Pacing & Character Development**: Pacing was rather slow, each episode seems like, the MC would go into his emo phase. Uninteresting persona, I can't really relate to his #Feels, so it did nothing for me. 
3. ~~**[This gif (NSFW)](http://i.imgur.com/fJXUXe7.gif)**... (Throws up in mouth). "Poor you, can't handle old saggy boob nudity", no it's not that, it's... why even throw something like that in the show at all. I get it may be a cultural thing, but it can stay out of mine. that gif was like the only thing i could think of after seeing it in a thread ~episode 2. so +2 episodes after that + slow pacing+Uninteresting developments, i was like... nope... i can survive not seeing this show, ever.~~ I was master trolled aparently. GG
4. **Sports Genre**: I played 10 years of Football, 6 years of Track and Field. Grew up in San Antonio, Tx, where "San Antonio Spurs" decals are everywhere you look (Jerseys, Car Stickers, Commercial Ads, Products in the store, etc). I love sports, but i can't get into Sports anime for some odd reason. It's like, I get "teamwork, integrity, hardships!", i lived through it. Including loosing in a state championship finals my freshman year (6'5 280 lbs lineman, was easy to become a varsity freshman). It may be that i just lived enough of sports in my life that i could care less anymore, is the way i feel about sports genre anime. 

So generally, with all this combined, these are the reasons why i dropped it. Everyone has their own tastes, i have my own. like i said, i can see why others may like this, but it wasn't my cup of tea


>> ARTICLE
> I get "teamwork, integrity, hardships

That's odd that it's one of your reasons, because Ping Pong didn't focus on the typical sports anime clichs of friendship and hard work, in fact one character was flat out told that he will never succeed as he is physically incapable to beat his competitors.

As I'm sure has been reiterated to you, it's a show about players having their own approaches to the world, and displayed through Ping Pong, rather than about the sport itself.
>> ARTICLE
Le Humb**le**brag
>> ARTICLE
1. You dislike stuff when it's hyped? What does anyone else's opinion have anything to do with yours? I don't blame you for dropping it for personal reasons but damn, what a way to short sell it.

2. "MC" gets his focus for a few episodes and it's gone afterwards. There's at least 5 MCs in this show.

3. Not sure how you were "trolled." Did you assume the gif was Ping Pong because of the similar title, or did someone link it to you with such a malicious intent?

4. This ain't even sports. There's no team shit, no unrealistic power training. This isn't Free.

No offense, but I don't think you watched enough of the show to understand why others like it. You can keep it on your dropped list if you want, but you're making some broad, nonsensical arguments against its value.

that gif was never in the show lol

I think it's more well founded because this show has such a large barrier of entry, mainly its whacky art style. Even if it was recent I'm willing to bet there are a very large number of people who will never experience it because it looks like crap at first glance. If I didn't watch it with friends I would have missed a truly fantastic experience.
>> ARTICLE
> Aren't WT! threads supposed to be for not very well-known anime?

Not really, we've a few popular series getting recommended and there isn't really a rule to recommend only unpopular ones. That being said, Ping Pong is rank 879 when it comes to popularity on MAL while Welcome to the NHK! is rank 85. The only reason why one of them gets more talk than the other is because one aired in 2014 and the other in 2006, recent series are usually more mentioned than others.

Your own experience does not equate to the amount of times Welcome to the NHK has been mentioned on /r/anime.  Also, if you look at just the numbers, on MAL Welcome to the NHK has a popularity ranking of #85 compared to Ping Pong's meager #879.  Just saying

PONG PONG. Nuff said funny as hell.

Oh, simple note, but overall, in any anime sports you cited (well, Kuroko No Basuke and Haikyuu), you could also replace the sports by another one and have the same dynamics, character development (even if it's almost non existant). The argument does not truly work only for Ping Pong the Animation.

I liked ping pong and usually the first or two seasons of a sports animes. Ping pong was a nice break from super sports moves that all the main characters seem to have as more seasons are made.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny for you guys who dropped this anime because of "ugly" artstyle. I mean, did you guys even read the first 10 chapter to get used to Matsumoto's artstyle and know what was the story about?

Do you guys even know who directed this anime? Or even the animation director is? It's a complete match for Maasaki Yuasa to directed this show.

Honestly, I don't even know who is this Matsumoto and untik 4chan suddenly got freaked out when they announced Ping Pong The Animation.

Heck, I just need 5 chapters to change my mind from "what the heck with this 5 year old artstyle" to "What a wonderful point of view this artstyle trying to tell to the readers"

Watch This.  It's basically a recommendation post.

Perfect 10. My only possible complaint was Ota's hair. Objectively speaking, it's probably the best anime I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Finished watching it a hour ago,it's really good,but the weird art sure is weird.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is one of the anime that are great on every imaginable level - structure, visuals, music, character development, atmosphere and the idea of a "hero" figure is something that I still remember every now and then (heck, I sometimes myself chant "The Hero Appears" in my mind just because it is *that* cool). Would recommend/10.

Nice little review, you touched essential points of the show, I enjoyed reading it.
>> ARTICLE
The art bothered me in the first episode but after that I didn't even think about it. One of the best shows I've watched, 9/10.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite anime so far, and one of only 3 things (and the only non-movie) that I have given a 10/10 to on MAL
>> ARTICLE
It's been in my t3 ever since I finished it, and I don't see it moving any time soon. It's so close to perfection, even more so than what I ranked above it (S;G, Monogatari). Good write up, but I'd also like to note the fantastic use of imagery and symbolism. Here are two of my favourite uses:

Kazama [](/s "as a giant monster and a dragon to Kong, showing how helpless and intimidated he is in their match, while also being an obstacle to him returning home (the dragon taking control of the plane)").

Smile [](/s "breaking free of his robot skeleton, along with the fantastic "my blood tastes like iron" quote, to show that he is having fun, passionate, and desperately trying to win against Peco. It shows his new found humanity"). 
>> ARTICLE
I'm about half way through this right now, and it's pretty damn good. It's about the characters more than the game. They don't even explain the rules. Definitely warrants consideration in the discussion over best sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
I love Ping Pong to no end. Kong has one of the most compelling character arc's I've seen, and so does pretty much everyone. They all make sense. 

> The biggest barrier to watching Ping Pong for some people is the artwork. While some people might find it "ugly", I feel that Ping Pong would not be the same without its unique art style.

I see this so much as an excuse brought up (heck on the YouTube episodes almost every ep someone was like "this show looks ugly"), I'm thinking I am going to rewatch the show with a focus on visuals, and later post a full writeup analyzing the various aspects of the animation (shot composition, fluidity, design, consistency) and talk about what it does well and poorly. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was really great. I think I cried.
>> ARTICLE
I saw Ping Pong as a live action, which is excellent, one of the best movies I've ever seen. Am looking forward to the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Tl;Dr It is one of the best shows you will watch

even the sometimes weird art fits
>> ARTICLE
I made it 45 seconds into the first episode before dropping it, which might be a record for me.  The art style is terrible, to this day I can not fathom why the r/anime hivemind likes this show so much.

I don't really care how good the plot and characters are, the art style is simply un-watchable to me.  But hey we're all entitled to our opinions right?

side note:  in before negative karma.  The hivemind does not like its favorite artsy animes being put down.

I only made it 25 seconds in, so you held out longer than I did.

I respect your opinion, and I can see where you're coming from.  However, I personally value character growth and good story more than a visually appealing anime.  
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I tend to fall into the camp of 'all I really care about is if the female characters are appealing'.  Ping pong fails this test pretty hard... I don't think it has any female characters at all!

Over the years I've been so consistently disappointed by badly written anime plots that I've simply given up on that style of anime.  I'm sure there are exceptions; anime's with great plot, and maybe ping pong is one, but I'm unwilling to give it a chance.
>> ARTICLE
>  but I'm unwilling to give it a chance.

That's a real shame.  While the artwork is also unorthodox, maybe you'll enjoy The Tatami Galaxy?
>> ARTICLE
That one came out a a few years ago I think, I don't think I watched it.  I must have missed it.  I'll check out the first episode when I have some time.  
>> ARTICLE
You definitely should check it out.  I finished watching it yesterday, and now it's my favorite anime.
>> ARTICLE
>  I personally value character growth and good story more than a visually appealing anime.

I do as well, but Ping Pong is not a "not visually appealing anime"; it's an intentionally ugly anime.  There's a significant difference and I don't care for a producer to scratch my eyes.  If I really want some good characters and story without shoving a knife into my eyes, I'll rewatch LoGH.
>> ARTICLE
I personally didn't mind the unique art style, and I actually think Ping Pong would be worse without its defining artwork.
>> ARTICLE
I love how Gintama manages to make this list too.
>> ARTICLE
Not really surprising.  This is just for Gintama': Enchousen (2012).  Gintama (2006) Is rated 46 or something in popularity.  When people add shows to their MAL, they don't always take into consideration that additional seasons in MAL often get added as separate entries.

Really it's just because a lot of people who have watched a ton of Gintama still might not have made it that far. (I haven't yet)

Gintama makes every list.

Really hard to understand why Hajime No Ippo is so unpopular.

Ashita no Joe is enough boxing for me. I really don't need more than one anime in my life for any given sport.

I would think not a lot of anime watchers are into something like boxing. When you count over 100 episodes with all the series combined that adds to it also. Hajime no Ippo definitely one of my favorite series of all time though.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's sort of the reason but I don't even like boxing and Hajime No Ippo is in my top 3 easily.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I find myself watching a lot of sports anime when the only ones I follow are Cricket and to a lesser extent Football(Soccer)
>> ARTICLE
Definitely on my top list, but I feel a sort of dissonance when I tried watching an actual boxing match, it just didn't feel the same. The author and artist did something to Ippo to make the series spectacular.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because the manga and anime has to make every match insanely good, as intense as a boxing match can be, it's a battle shonen series afterall. Obviously only one in a thousand real pro matches can get close to it. Same with any sport.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Nodame Cantabile on this list. Just started season 1 and its so much fun.

>> ARTICLE
It might be too late for our trumpet girl as the anime's been out for quite a long time.
>> ARTICLE
Most likely never going to reach a decent scoring unless MAL somehow resets them (even so, it probably won't affect much of anything).

But for those wondering, Sora no Woto is a spectacular SoL series located in a very interesting post-apocalyptic setting. The show definitely has a very cute cast of characters, but it's not afraid to venture into a more heavy scene as the show progresses. Accompanied by the musical talents of Kalafina & Yuki Kajiura, the show has one of the best OSTs from a SoL. 

It is not at all a K-On clone like many have assumed it to be. The only drawback this show has is the fact that the world it takes place in is left devastatingly unexplored. I would've loved to learn more about the world this anime takes place in.

Give it a chance.

EDIT: A phrase.
>> ARTICLE
Nitpick: Sora no Woto's OST is by the unparalleled Ooshima Michiru (Xam'd, Tatami Galaxy, Zetsuen no Tempest). While I will disagree with you on the worth of the show as a whole, the soundtrack is a work of art. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems I've screwed up a little bit.

Perfectly fine if you don't hold it up as close to the candle as I do. Even if people don't agree with how great of a show it is, it's still a fine military SoL.
>> ARTICLE
Sold, added it to my plan to watch queue. Even though that means I still will probably never get to it but it's closer.

Also the statement about resetting the scores seems odd. Is there some reason that resetting the rates would bring the score up? Like was there a bunch of hatred for this show at one point and was given crap ratings. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not too sold on the idea that resetting the scores would bring up the score by much either (despite mentioning it). That's just the only solution I could see possibly working that would raise it's current rating. Sort of just threw the idea out there since the chances of MAL getting a score reset is unlikely

Then again, I'm not sure what the reason was for the initial dislike the show received when it had aired. I'm just assuming the general consensus now is that it isn't deserving of it's current low-ish score. And I agree with it. 

Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.
>> ARTICLE
>Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.

Pretty much this. haha. I don't know what could be done so that the scoring was meaningful. Just hope someone recommends and speaks out for those diamonds in the rough so you get a chance to experience them.
>> ARTICLE
Scoring will never be a useful tool for reviewing without some form of commentary to go along with it. All my scores on my MAL are only meant to be useful for myself.

Thankfully there are always a few reviews on MAL & other websites that give me a little bit more than just a score.

It's because many of them extra seasons.

To get to Book of Circus you have to watch two seasons (many put off by the second), Hanamonogatari three seasons and Nekomonogatari kuro and for Mushishi Zoku Shou you need to watch the first season.

I watched part of it before, but it was too depressing and soul crushing for me that I dropped it.  Lately I've been toying with the idea of rewatching and then finishing it, but before I do, I'd like to ask something.  Does it have a happy/at least semi-happy ending?  If he ends up just being a slave or dying or something it won't feel like the watch was worth it at all for me... so I'd like to know beforehand not to watch it if there's a bad end.

Please, dont think that cross game is anything like Kotoura-san. Its Adachi's most accessible and easy to watch/read series, and easily one of his best.

Adachi is the master of nostalgia high school sports, mixed in with somewhat opaque romance and usually a touch of tragedy. Its a brilliant mix, and hes been doing it for the better part of 30 years

Comparing the two is an insult to Cross Game.

What would you say is the target then? The anime basically aired during a time slot that was appopriate for a younger audience.

its shounen sports that borders on sienen at times.

But adachi doesn't write your normal shounen sports ala slum dunk style, he has his own unique style

It also frequently opened with a drawing song and displayed pictures submitted by viewers at the end of the episode. That means it is, at least in part, targeted towards kids.

I've got casual anime friends and colleagues who watch a series solely by word of mouth, or on recommendation only.

Really, there's no other prerequisite to watching anime than watching anime. We're all fans here.

No. Some are fans of what's popular. Others are anime fans and do try to know more about something they like.

I'm pretty sure most "anime fans" say they're fans but only care about watching what's popular, which is only a small fragment of what anime is.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, anime has much more depth than what's popular, but honestly, if people are enjoying themselves, then there's no harm to it. Popular shows are good for socializing and community, anyway. I feel that's a much stronger part of what we are than if we were to view anime as art, and it's where anime cons, doujins and even this sub draws strength from.

So it's only better for us if we were to be excellent to everybody here :)

You're legitimately missing out. Get on one of them!

Alright. I have a ton of anime on my list already, but you can never have too many. Haha
>> ARTICLE
Sure, they've heard about them. But have they actually *watched* them?
>> ARTICLE
A lot of sequels, as expected. Since only the ones that liked the first season would pick up the second too.

Seeing a lot of great shows on here, like the Aria series, Gin no Saji and Chihayafuru.

Chihayafuru made both lists! S1 on other the other one and S2 here! It's such a great show and should get more attention so we can get a S3

Utena is unpopular, I think I've officially given up on the anime community. 
>> ARTICLE
Granted, its REALLY FUCKING OLD. Then again, so too is Sailor Moon and DBZ...
>> ARTICLE
> ...its REALLY FUCKING OLD.

Utena is from 1996.  That might be old, but not 'REALLY FUCKING OLD'.  Talk to me about 'REALLY FUCKING OLD' when we're discussing shows from the 60s and 70s, you babby.  :P
>> ARTICLE
For me, that's pretty old in terms of Animu. 

Then again, I like things like Rose of Versailles and Candy Candy, so yes, I can talk about REALLY FUCKING OLD if you want :3
>> ARTICLE
Growing up back on the old anime forums and geocities (damn I feel old) all people talked about was Utena and then I finally saw it around 2001-2 and I understood why. It's a shame that classic deconstruction series like this are not well known but everyone knowns Evangelion (It's my favourite series but it really is kind of over rated). 
>> ARTICLE
I think they're both iconic and should be studied, but shoujo, for better or for worse, has always been overlooked in terms of actual influence and interest.
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely agree with that regard but Shoujo has had quite the effect overall on mainstream anime and has also resisted the changes of mainstream anime as well. 
>> ARTICLE
It has, but its also a lot less popular in absolute terms, for better or for worse. 

(I mean my favorite "old time" series are things like Rose of Versailles, so you're preaching to the choir here :P)

But yes, there are a ton of really iconic series.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely, we need to try and raise awareness! At least if only so people can see how much affect shjo has on anime period. 

And I feel like a terrible shjo fan because I never saw rose of versaille, and I've always wanted to. :(
>> ARTICLE
It's on Crunchyroll! Go check it out, FANTASTIC series. 
>> ARTICLE
It's in my queue, I actually found it today. I'll check it out once I'm done with Saint Seiya Omega (I tend to only watch 3-4 series at a time, any more and I lose interest) which should be tomorrow since I'm marathoning the series. . 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Utena was ever on Toonami/Cartoon Network, though. Could very well be wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
First time I saw anything Utena related was the movie back in 2002 on the International Channel, I actually didn't see the anime series until a few years after that when Anime Network aired it. 
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't, but it was one of the first major series imported to the US en masse 
>> ARTICLE
That's probably why it's not all that popular, though. Most people I know who watched anime when they were younger watched it on Toonami, including myself. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe? I know some kids like me were a bit proactive and started searching for imports when we were younger though.
>> ARTICLE
Utena is really old, and quite niche. :(
>> ARTICLE
I mean I know shjo is niche in the west but when it first came out Utena was big over here, I think it's more the culture has changed and we can only remember so many "classics" and they're invariably marketed towards the largest fanbase, boys. 
>> ARTICLE
This shows that not enough people have accepted Yuasa as their lord and savior.

There's some good stuff on this list. Shoutout to Kuuchuu Buranko at the very bottom!

I might've been tempted to strip out sequels entirely. But it's your list, you did the work, so nice one.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I thought about only putting the first entry of a series I'd encounter that fits the criteria at first, but there aren't that many in the end, and I still find it interesting when compared with the attach rate. Major's attach rate is absurdly high compared to Mushishi for instance, despite the latter being in the top 30.
>> ARTICLE
I think it would have been nice to free up space for others in the list by collapsing sequels to one entry. Attach rates for diff seasons could be in a note column or something
>> ARTICLE
I am in the crowd of "Mushishi is great ... I never watched the second or third season".

It's too episodic / "too much of the same" and I never had enough interest to keep watching it after the first series.
>> ARTICLE
I always find it funny how I see people say "Mushishi is great but you should take it slow" while I'm sitting over here marathoning it every time I watch it. I specifically waited until Zoku Shou was finished airing so I could watch it all at once. Now I just have to wait for the movie.

There is no 3rd season by the way.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I thought I saw 3 entries in MAL on it, shrug.
>> ARTICLE
The second season was split into 2 cours + a movie, iirc. 
>> ARTICLE
> Kuuchuu Buranko

This sounds very interesting, is it any good? I might give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have much to add to SSVD's answer, but yeah, while it isn't everyone's cup of tea -- which is fine -- it's a fascinating show which is definitely worth a shot.
>> ARTICLE
One of my personal favorites. It's more psychedelic and trippy than SHAFT shows, but its a show about psychiatry, so it's very fitting. Highly recommended if you like dramas. The show I think it's closest to in initial impressions/structure is The Tatami Galaxy.

It is episodic in nature, but every episode runs concurrently over the same 2 week time period, so they all interweave in subtle ways. Each one is about Irabu helping people with their mental problems, and it's consistently funny and touching.

In terms of production values, Irabu's VA lifts the show up 10 points alone, OP/ED are both great, music's wonderful, the art is excellent, and I hope you like live-action elements in anime, since this goes full Aku no Hana every now and then, (probably to cover up that there's very little animation in the thing).

I'd call it a 9, as it might have benefited a little more from a stronger overarching narrative, but the individual arcs are all fantastic.

Sounds awesome, I'll check it out later, thanks!

Shit, I thought I was the only person who did that. Spent a week watching both seasons, and when I was on my computer and not watching Chihayafuru the OP was playing in the background, because the OP is glorious.

Didn't expect to see MSG: The 08th MS Team on this list, but I imagine it fell under the radar due to being a 90's OVA for one reason or another. I for one think of it as a gem. Not to mention, Shiro and Aina had such a sweet romance.
>> ARTICLE
Just counted, and I haven't watched 54 of these. But seriously, we need to let others know [Patema Inverted](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12477). It's an awesome anime to watch.
>> ARTICLE
It is a cruel world that would ignore the majesty of Whisper of the Heart. A very cruel, world. 

Looking over the list it's funny to see how many 'must watch' anime are on it. Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Revolutionary Girl Utena, MSG: 8th Team, Conan, Dennou Coil, and Maison Ikkoku all stand out as being among the most critically lauded shows in anime history. 

None of which I've yet to finish, mind you. Which says an awful lot about me. 
>> ARTICLE
Some of them are pretty daunting, I should've included the number of episodes as well. The only one I've seen that you listed here is Dennou Coil, which was very good. Reminded me of Steins;Gate in its pace.

And the colors! The color palettes are kinda pale and faint, almost drab. Kinda overexposed.

Lol?
>> ARTICLE
I'm thrashing through LotGH at the moment. It's absolutely enthralling. Really can't stress how little it matters that it was made in 1993. It deals with things I've never seen another anime deal with, and is overwhelmingly compelling to watch one episode to the next. The only anime I can compare it to, in terms of how high a regard it holds its themes, is Monster. They're about completely different things, but the essence of how they deal with the real issues surrounding humanity is similar.
>> ARTICLE
> Revolutionary Girl Utena

What is wrong with you people? This is one of the greatest anime ever made. 


>> ARTICLE
> What is wrong with you people? 

Nothing *wrong* with these people per say... but you forget that the majority of people on /r/anime and MAL are basically the same age as Utena.  If it's 15 years or older, most people haven't seen it unless it's mainstream.

Also, most people here are guys, and won't necessarily get into things ostensibly for girls.
>> ARTICLE
I was being sort of facetious. The thing is anime is way more popular as a whole than when I was getting into the scene. There are way more of us now than there were 15 years ago. 

Anyway thanks for making me feel weird. /s It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.
>> ARTICLE
> It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.

I always found this funny.  Watching anime in general is already a niche that's, at best, looked at strangely by the general population.  The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing.  Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).
>> ARTICLE
> I always found this funny. Watching anime in general is already a niche that's, at best, looked at strangely by the general population.

Funnily enough even in its home country. 

> The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing. Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).

I think it goes without saying that our society is geared against folks that don't identify with the general norm. I read manga/watch anime for the art, the story and the characters but despite having all of those I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(
>> ARTICLE
> Funnily enough even in its home country.

Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

> I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(

Sure you are, do what you want!  I watch crap for kids and adults; crap for guys and girls, it doesn't matter.  Quality and artistry doesn't know gender.  Let the haters hate.  Besides, this is the anonymity of the internet too, so:

1) Who cares what other people have to say.

2) You'll find a lot more like minded people here than you would have assumed.
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

Oh definitely, tho there is rampant homophobia as well it just manifests differently (like being gay is considered a phase that kids go through in Japanese culture). But the stigma in Japan for anime in general is a lot like the stigma for watching cartoons over here in that its still seen as something primarily for children. 

> Sure you are, do what you want! I watch crap for kids and adults; crap for guys and girls, it doesn't matter. Quality and artistry doesn't know gender. Let the haters hate. Besides, this is the anonymity of the internet too, so:

I wasn't quite saying that I personally would change what I like, I've been watching what I like for damn near over a decade and a half now, just critiquing the dominant view. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm at episode 12 from 39 and to me it seems like the plot is just starting, while Ping Pong, the masterpiece of anime, already finished an episode ago. 

I'm definitely having fun up to this point and it'll probably blow my mind by the time I'm finished, but the show is taking it's time. And shojo's of the 90's look weird. NGE looks way better.
>> ARTICLE
You're almost at one of the best arcs ever made for any anime period, the Black Rose arc, look forward to it. 

Trust me, by the time you finish this, you'll be a believer. Just be glad you didn't get the movie four years before the series like those of us way back when. :p Also shjo, at least in manga, has not really changed since the late 80s except males have become skinnier, it's only in the anime adaptations where utena eschews a more shnen look for keeping the shjo flowery approach. 

NGE is my favourite anime ever, and yes it looks good, but so does Utena in a different way. 
>> ARTICLE
Just stumpled upon this thread and by now I have finished Utena. Still don't relaly know what to think. It definitely well done, but at face value it does so little and I am not all that good with symbolism. It had some really hilarious stuff. That's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck is wrong with you?
>> ARTICLE
Well rheumatism, arthritis, demen-wait what was I talking about again? /s
>> ARTICLE
It can be pretty painful to watch. I mean how many times must I see the stair climbing montage? Only to be outdone by the elevator taking montage. 

Also, plenty of times throughout the show I wanted to scream "What the hell are you trying to tell me?" So it can be a frustrating show for people that are driven by plot as opposed to themes and symbolism.  
>> ARTICLE
Man the stair-climbing/elevator-taking are when things get real in an episode, they serve an important point. Repetition is a huge focus for reinforcing themes. Remember Utena is about growing up, the stair-climbing, elevator-taking are symbolic of going from lower to higher, that is becoming an adult. 
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea how Utena is so low (comparatively) in terms of ranking, both popularity and score-wise. How have more people not watched this show? I've met people who've watched a ton of anime who've never even heard of it. Is it because it's a magical girl series (kinda)? Is it because Utena's a girl? Are most people really that unwilling to watch anime that's more than seven years old? People on here talk about Penguindrum fairly frequently, and obviously a lot of attention is on Ikuhara with Yuri Kuma Arashi. I wish that there'd be more discussion about Utena beyond it being mentioned as a classic because it has so much depth to it, it easily deserves threads on the level of, say, the NGE rewatch. 
>> ARTICLE
I got bored after 14 episodes and quit watching. I can't relate to anyone in the show they are all so backwards.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly there actually were rewatch threads on here for Utena a few months ago. But only like two people posted in them.
>> ARTICLE
It's odd because all throughout the late 90s - early 2000s Utena was hailed as a masterpiece even if half the people watching it didn't understand that it was largely a coming-of-age story. 

But really Utena is to shjo what NGE is to mainstream anime, remembering that shjo while influential on the mainstream is largely resistant to the mainstream as well, an endpoint to a bleak era after the economic downturn of the 80s-90s. It was a clean break between the themes prevalent before and after. I think there are enough of us around to create a decent discussion thread. :p

Is the 'Aria' series worth pursuing? 
>> ARTICLE
it is my second favorite series behind hunter x hunter
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. I watch very little slice of life because I often find the majority of them to be mostly pointless apart from them making you feel comfy. I noticed that the Aria trilogy was quite often referred to as best SOL out there so I decided to give it a shot and it turned out to be one of my favourite shows.

 It is a coming of age story what gets better with each series and ends perfectly in my opinion. What made me love this series so much was how the main character Akari viewed and interpreted the world around her in such a beautiful way that I couldn't help but feel warm and fuzzy inside. 

The OST is also great at making you feel relaxed and comfy, here is one of my favourite songs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1hGtQxHvs 

I can't recommend this series enough, the only negative I can think of is that I found the cat's voice a little annoying initially but like the series he grew on me very quickly.
>> ARTICLE
It's an episodic slice of life anime about rowing gondolas on terraformed Mars. There is an overall linear progression, but it's mostly about the development of its characters. There's no denying it's hard to get into for most people, but it's charming and soothing, and it ends on a conclusive high note.

I would say that a large amount of the sequels could have been taken out, as they typically have viewers that decided to watch based on the first season, giving them unnaturally higher ratings. 

Edit: You may also want to think about removing those with scorers around the 12,000 mark and above, because quite a few of them are well known (At least on reddit (as it seems to me))

Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of sports shows... including the best one: One Outs!!!!

Big Windup! is one of my favorite sports anime so I'm glad its getting the recognition it deserves
>> ARTICLE
Dennou Coil is a masterpiece. It really is just about perfect. 

It has an interesting and well thought out world. Characters are likeable and relatable. The story has a well pacing, is interesting and actual works out. The soundtrack, while nothing really special, is used very well, always fits and underlines the atmosphere, but also knows when to be silent.

But I'm sad X, Arjuna or Giant Killing didn't make it. At least X could've managed to get it. Clamp manga animated by Madhouse? It should've been popular. Arjuna has Yoko Kanno's best work, but a weird story. I like it.

**BUT** how in fuck did Inu Yasha get in there? Judging by the 120 episodes I watched before droping it, it isn't a contender for top 100.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen InuYasha, but this is the second season. To get there you must have already went through 167 episodes, and judging by the description, it seems to be much faster paced (covering 21 chapters in 26 episodes compared to 35 in 167, from my understanding), which must contribute a lot to its high rating.

There is quite some stuff on that list that I adore(Cross Game, Chihayafuru, Kaiji, Gin no Saji, ...) but it makes sense.

I got to most of those through checking the Top MAL scores and not because they got recommended or written about.

But there are also a lot of em that seem to sit on my ptw list forever, since there is always something "more important" to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen quite a few of these shows mentioned here but haven't watched them yet, I should really get around to that. The attach rate is interesting, most shows are below .6. It would be interesting if MAL included that stat itself so we could compare shows by what percent of  people dropped/finished it more easily.

[Kyoukai no Kanata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMlwer-lbow&list=PL04C93C0E6491D2E3&index=26) has a pretty beast ED.  This is the full version if that matters.

Also...[Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qrQWyuM3U) always got me hyped to watch the next episode.

[Shinsekai Yori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV31EHwtayo) just recently got voted best ED on this /r/anime.

Always gotta give some love to Cowboy Bebop's [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2rVnRwW0h8) and [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nftxDrStny8).

Personally, I love to listen to [Trigun's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSX58TglZRs) OP while trying to psyche myself up to go workout (hasn't worked yet, but I'll be happy when it does).

I think that not mentioning [Baccano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msg8ypnLqaw)'s OP would be a tragedy too.

[Soul Eater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDU2H7q_sJI)'s second OP is awesome and beautiful to look at. (Seriously, just watch it; it's awesome looking).  Although this isn't the full version of the song because copyright laws and stuff.

I think [FMA:Brotherhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfNGe6VCbhc)'s OP was like, super amazing.

[Spice and Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN_WgwEmRaw) has a very mellow OP if you like that kind of thing.

[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uH8a6Sra0)'s first ED isn't particularly notable until you watch it...the dance they do was a pretty big thing in Japan (and maybe other places, I don't know).  If you play LoL, it's Ezreal's dance. Also, I liked their second [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpF-xWBKmwk) (I say! I say! My heaven!)

Also, Aldnoah.Zero's (second?) ED was great, but there aren't any good versions of it on Youtube (it's called I say cry, you can find it if you google it) and the [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5v01DgVRX0) is pretty great too. (This one is a cover, but I think it's pretty indistinguishable from the original.)

Oh, and [Parasyte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZVr-Zu9vPM)'s OP, [Your Lie in April](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rG41l8FUNs)'s OP and [Log Horizon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW6sEkTGbUc)'s OP

Music man, gotta love it.

You mentioned a whole bunch of my favorite OP's and ED's.  GSN, Bebop, Trigun, Baccano (I should really finish this show), fucking paper moon (Soul Eater), Yui's Again (FMA:B; acoustic version is the tits, as well), S&W, and finally SUPAH DRIVAH!

Mah bruthuh/sistah, 

Post your faves I missed!!! I wanna know now since it sounds like we like the same stuff!!

I loved Nozaki-kun's OP! Beyond the Boundary's ED was also pretty special. Spice and Wolf's OP is what got me into the show in the first place, too. I'd add Nichijou's [OP1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfF7HqZm_vA) and [OP2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUzNLayMrJk) to the list, though. Heck, add its [ED1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKiph4Pren4) to the list, too!

One of my all time favourites is [Fairy Tail's first OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdrGjixAtKU). So catchy!
>> ARTICLE
Lol, so I guess I'm watching Nichijou next.   

Oh, and you mentioning Fairy Tail reminded me of my favorite [Bleach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFMg6GA5ja0) OP. (It's #6) (Also, I like guitar) (A lot)

Hentai ji to Warawanai Neko - Opening and ending... really catchy.
Tengen Toppa Guren Lagann - Not the OP, but the song Libera me from hell... not sure if it counts... but it should... that song is almost as awesome as Kamina.

Great list, and good call on skipping the sequels so we can see more series here.

I didn't know YYH was '92 though, damn.


>> ARTICLE
Not too surprising, considering that it was a competitor to DBZ.

Though the art style for both seemed to hold up fairly well, given the age.
>> ARTICLE
And so, my PTW grows even more.

Surprised that NGE, Gunbuster, Akira and some others really popular anime don't make the list. Great years I'm going to say.
>> ARTICLE
>And so, my PTW grows even more

I actually got excited by this list due the older series listings, as I absolutely love cel animation. That and it never hurts to expand your horizons a little.
>> ARTICLE
NGE just barely missed out (8.31 to Whisper's 8.34).  Gunbuster and Akira were both '88, and it's hard for anything to go toe to toe with two Ghiblis and LotGH.  
>> ARTICLE
So what you're saying is '88 was a great year.
>> ARTICLE
I still have a tank '88 pengi in my closet.
>> ARTICLE
1998 was stacked, holy crap.
>> ARTICLE
98 and 99 are the only two years where I've seen all 3 of the top 3. I was 2/3 for 97. I've also seen more Anime in the top 3 in the 90s than the other decades. Weird since I didn't start watching Anime until 2004 or so. 
>> ARTICLE
As was 1988. Also, 2008 is generally considered one of the stronger years iirc. 

I guess 2018 will be a year to look forward to.

Now I love InuYasha, it came out at the exact right time for me to love it, but is really the third best anime to come out in the year 2000? Guess Ill have to do some investigating.
>> ARTICLE
If you love InuYasha, have you explored the previous Takahashi Rumiko series like Ranma and more importantly Urusei Yatsura? Or Maison Ikkoku?
>> ARTICLE
In 2000, we didn't know that the story wasn't going anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
The manga ending was cute
>> ARTICLE
The list excludes sequels, so yes and no. Banner of the Stars, Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2, Detective Conan Movie 04 and Vampire Hunter D (2000) were left out. I guess it depends on whether you count seasons/sequels separately, or just count entire franchises/series as being one anime
>> ARTICLE
Hell yea, Dougram and Votoms made the top three of their respective years. Ryosuke Takahashi banzai~

Hell yeah Space Cobra! My mother was huge fan, as a result I watched a lot of episodes with her when I was younger and it was awesome. The rugball arc was one of my favorite thing as a kid
>> ARTICLE
Your mother (and by extension yourself) is a damn cool lady.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first season of Mushishi with a friend in the last few days and I have to say it's one of the most beautiful anime I have ever seen. It just sucks you into this world and you want to know more about the Mushi and everything surrounding them. To everyone who wants to see and anime that is athmospheric and tells beautiful stories of a rich world go and watch it!
>> ARTICLE
And I have effectively seen 0 of them, except for those that aired on TV. Great times.

Good to see patlabor there.

This list reminded me I still need to finish Monster. So much anime, so little time :(

so if i want a top 3 of 2006-till now what should i do? thx for doing this btw

Thanks for doing this.  I'm fairly new to anime, so I'm always looking for more titles I should watch.

>> ARTICLE
Shoutout to Kino's Journey for top anime I've seen that nobody else has seen.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen much of it, but I fucking love it.

Episode 2 was just... Woah.
>> ARTICLE
don't be silly, it's quite popular
>> ARTICLE
On here? Not so much I think. It's pretty popular among critics and bloggers though.
>> ARTICLE
firstly, I addressed someone who claimed *nobody has seen it*

secondly, here I believe it belongs to the broad category 'upvoted while regularly mentioned as *not popular, yet fantastic*'
>> ARTICLE
Okay, semantics. It might be popular but not many people have actually seen it, which is what he was trying to say in that "Shoutouts to" meme-hyperbole I think(only 38k finished it on MAL).
>> ARTICLE
Lots of great shows I recognize here, and lots of shows I guess I need to check out. Hopefully more people will watch Planetes and Princess Tutu, and other, older shows as a result. Anime existed before 2007 :D

Thanks for the list, very useful! I would've suggested also adding the English titles where applicable, though :)
>> ARTICLE
I was pleasantly surprised to see Princess Tutu up there. Didn't think it had a wide enough appeal for it to rank like that.
>> ARTICLE
Wide appeal is more about how popular it is, but how can you watch that show and not like it? I'm actually of the opposite mind - recommended it to some older friends with kids, like Avatar - everyone can watch it, and there are multiple layers to engage with it on, so the more you put into the show, the more you get out of it. Something for everyone to enjoy and appreciate without feeling like you're "watching down" or missing stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting that in 1970 the top 3 is spots anime.
>> ARTICLE
Urusei Yatsura!

Kimagure Orange Road!

Interesting to see how many full-length movies are in the top 3 over the years.
>> ARTICLE
No Ranma?
>> ARTICLE
It's there, under 1989.
>> ARTICLE
I guess 1972 was a down year for anime, considering the top entry is ranked #2763.

Well, it's either that or nobody's really seen any of the shows that aired in 1972.
>> ARTICLE
MAL's demographic includes few Japanese people and few people who were even alive in 1972, and not much of the anime from back has ever been exported. [Muumin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8235/Muumin_\(1972\)) for example was *super* popular in Japan, but has less than 500 completed watchers on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
> MAL's demographic includes few Japanese people and few people who were even alive in 1972

This. Absolutely, this. Basically no one in Japan uses MAL- why? because it is not IN JAPANESE. Nevermind there are many other anime info services for Japanese users...

Huh, I wonder if Dougram really is considered that good or if it's just #2 by virtue of being alright. Downloaded it a few weeks ago.

Making a list of just 5 is tough. There's quite a few shows that I might swap on or off the list given more thought, but if I had to pick 5 just off the top of my head I'd go with:

* Steins;Gate

* Durarara!!

* Berserk

* Kino no Tabi

* Ghost in the Shell (1995 movie)

In no particular order.
>> ARTICLE
how does the berserk anime compare w/ the manga? cuz the mangas pretty freakin intense! 
>> ARTICLE
The series is pretty much a promotional campaign for the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Its still intense. They removed most of the gore to get it on tv but left tons of blood and sexual themes. Also the series only covers the 'golden age' arc, Gutt's time with the band of the hawk.

Why is some jackass going round downvoting everyone's post? Do you not understand that people have an opinion and enjoy different things to you and hence the point of the thread? It's whoever you are that deter people from posting in this thread and sharing their top 5. 
>> ARTICLE
>Why is some jackass going round downvoting everyone's post?

Because Reddit is sadly full of idiots who don't understand what the purpose of downvotes is.

Or it might be the someone who just doesn't like the fact that lots of people like shows that aren't shounen. That's a bit of a long shot, but it wouldn't surprise me if there were people like that out there.

It's always nice to see someone reading comics nowadays. I haven't read comics in a really long time. Although I'm a DC guy I'm always to open to reading Marvel's stuff. You got any really good recommendations? 
>> ARTICLE
Thor: God of Thunder is great and [the artwork is beautiful.](http://atlforte.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/thor-vs-gorr-spread.jpg)

The current run of Moon Knight is a series of one-shots that do [a great job of making the character.](http://imgur.com/a/aSM08)

Ms. Marvel is great. A new character, [who is a fan girl](http://i.imgur.com/QzfWuoZ.png), has taken the name.

Red Lanterns is really good because Guy Gardner and Supergirl get some character development.

Cosmic Marvel is [reallllllllllllllllly good](http://i.imgur.com/FUM3v.jpg).

Also New Avengers is good here's a summary by /u/GamiSB. The Infinity War gave me hope for big events in Marvel.

Something happened somewhere that is causing the multiverse to collide into itself. The Illuminati becomes aware of this and sets out to try and come up with solutions for it. Caps idea is to use the infinity gauntlet as he is unwilling to blow up any earths. The rest of the group thinks this is dumb and after Caps idea works but no longer becomes a reliable option (The infinity gems shatter minus the time gem) they wipe his memory of the problem and the groups existence and kick him out.
Stark then creates a plan to pump up the Avengers on a huge scale. He needs a team that can defeat anything without him being present all the time so he can work with the illuminati and so they can meet any potential threat that comes their way because of all this. SO he gets some roids and starts asking every mother fucker he can think of to join. Cap comes along for reasons.
The first crisis they respond to is Ex Nihlio and Abyss who are left overs from a race of beings who sent them out to bring life to the universe. That race was called The Builders. They send to earth some pods that are supposed to kick start the Earths evolution again but because of the multiverse collapse universe 616 is damaged and nothing is working. So we get a damaged Nightmask, Starbrand, and Captain Universe. The rest of Avengers until Infinity is dealing with the clean up of this. Just all the stuff Nilo did not working which leads to a signal being shot off telling the Builders where Earth is and it's need for destruction. Did I mention this guy becomes an Avengers? Because he is.
Over in New Avengers the Illuminati are taking steps to build world destroying bombs and learning about what they are up against. They have captured Black Swan who was responsible for telling Black Panther what was happening. Not much happens other than preparation. We are shown the Mapmakers heralds who raise planets to weaken them for the map makers but that's about all. Also Stark builds a device to collect energy for the bombs that also serves as a prison.
Infinity
So this race of beings called the Builders gets the signal that Earth is fucked and needs to be destroyed. Even double because they are aware of the incursions as well and destroying an earth insures the safety of the rest of that universe from the collapse. They set off concurring any planets in their way and make a B line for Earth. The rest of the galaxy is kinda pissed at this and starts up a war with them. Quick and Dirty, Avengers save the day through Captain Universe and Starbrand. Thor has a cool moment and everyone else sorta just pretends like they are useful for 12 issues or something.
Meanwhile Thanos is on a mission to kill all his kids because Death's a bitch who can't make up her mind as to what gets her off. I personally think she just likes to fuck with the guy and he's just dumb enough not to get he's the joke. So Earth has one of his kids (i know right! So convenient) so while the Avengers are off saving the day he takes the shot to have a heart to heart with his son Thane. He ends up being betrayed by one of his own inner circle who sides with Thane and him and two of his lieutenants are trapped within a giant amber cube that is both life and death simultaneously. There might be a cat stuck in there as well.
Day is saved cook off everyone.
So now Stark is kinda worried. His Avengers team barely made it against the Builders and Black Swan is claiming those guys didn't have shit on other groups. He starts tinkering with his set up again and gets a gift from his granddaughter in the form of a new source of crazy energy through some pseudo crazy science about a world being in the same place as our earth just out of phase.
The Illuminati start using one of Reed's inventions "The Mirror" to start finding out about these other threats. The Black Priest are a group of magic users who go around fucking up earths and looking for people who can withstand "The Word" (that crazy language they speak) Strage get's a hard on for this kind of power and tries to sell his soul but haha no he's a fuck and has no soul.
The other group are the Map Makers. These are adaptiod creatures apparently created by AIM using data collected from the Avengers. They have tasked themselves with collecting data on the multiverse. They spread to earths, gather up data, and the destroy the inhabitants of that earth to insure nothing changes. They ride the Incurrsions in order to do so and have taken up residence within the space between universes.
With the last arc the two teams are split and no one except the Illuminati and now Dr. Banner knows what is really happening. Banner became a member of the illuminati after he figures everything out and using a double from another universe that AIM grabbed up to take the fall for him.
Steve remembers that the Illuminati roofied him and gets pissed. Goes banging down Stark's door asking why his butt hurts when the Time gem shows up and explodes. Avengers go all Bill and Ted a have a most excellent adventure through time, aka everyone except Future Franklin Richards tries to kill them. End result is Cap is told "don't be a dick brah" and we ended last issue on a cliff hanger over if he's gonna be a dick or a bro.
The Illuminati finally have their teenage existential crisis where Namor is the only one with a pair and blows up the "TOTALY NOT DC" Earth. Everyone freaks out on him and goes to cry after another incursion starts up. PLOT TWIST MOTHER FUCKER! after the 8 hours is up the earth isn't destroyed because King of the Sea formed up a new group with black jack and hookers and is off saving the day and staling for time. Questions?

How about The Punisher? is it good right now? and from where can i start? also how about doctor strange? and out of all the stuff you recommended can i just start and il be able to understand without reading all the previous comics?
>> ARTICLE
Punisher and Black Widow are good and had a crossover recently.

Usually with the Avengers you need some back ground, and Infinty is really good. However Marvel usually has a page telling what happened or has been happening.

Thor, Moon Knight, and Ms. Marvel need nothing to pick up. With Thor it's Thor: God of Thunder, with Ms. Marvel just make sure it's the current series same with Moon Knight.

Sorry for the late reply. Firstly thanks for your recommendations, i really do appreciate it.

I'm watching 9 shows that are currently airing. It was going to be 12, but there was no way I could keep up with everything. At least three of the shows I'm watching I'm five weeks behind.

Right now I'm dedicating everyday to marathon and catch up with a current show until I'm caught up with everything. I'm watching at least 3 OVAs a week. A movie everyday. A short 12 episode anime 2 days out of the week. And one really long anime periodically when I have time.

It's funny. I was out of anime for a long while until just last year. That's when I found /r/anime and MAL and now there's so much stuff that I want to watch, that it feels like I have to manage my time as if I were budgeting money to pay off a huge debt I owed.

Yea go Kuroko i think. Its freakin sweet. And third season is almost starting so its probably a great time to get into the show
>> ARTICLE
they're two entirely different shows about basketball, i've always preferred slam dunk because it was more believable and realistic than KnB. if you're into a typical shonen sports anime then KnB would be your best bet, otherwise i'd go with slam dunk. if you're not keen on the old animation style of slam dunk READ the manga, there's a reason why it's praised to highly
>> ARTICLE
Slam Dunk's manga is really good, and finishes a complete story, where the anime sorta fizzles out at the end. Slam Dunk is a great show though if you can get over the 90's aspects of it. It's on Crunchy Roll atm, and still pretty damn funny.
>> ARTICLE
Slam dunk is the way to go unless you want to read the manga after season 3 of kuroko.  Also, I remembered laughing out loud at slam dunk.  It definitely has numerous comedic scenes.  The biggest difference between the two is slam dunk doesn't have super power like making full court shots.  

Both are great.  Kuroko is the only other basketball anime i enjoyed after slam dunk ended a decade ago.  
>> ARTICLE
Watch slam dunk first since it's already done and it's very good anime and after you finish it read the Manga you can start where the anime left off.

Watch both. Honestly though. Slam Dunk is an amazing show. It's personally better than Kuroko.

Cross Game is a great sports anime. It's about baseball. It's a lot of fun to watch, I went through the 50 episodes like a breeze.

Chihayafuru and Ping Pong
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru is great. Like, I went into it thinking "Oh, well it's about some obtuse japanese card game. At least the character interactions should be good." Shit. The character interactions were great, believable, and even when they're playing it's intensely interesting.

The pacing is crazy too. Breakneck pace for a lot of the show, but some matches take multiple episodes. I feel I enjoyed a lot of the pacing TBH. Chihayafuru is way better than it has any business being.

Yowamushi Pedal is insanely good. It has a great premise, but slows down very much during the training part of the story, however after that it has the greatest interhigh competition ever imo.
Also the best part of it are the characters, especially the later ones. They all remind me of crazy pro-wrestling personas and gimmicks, that are not only fun to watch but work well with the story.

Slam Dunk would have no competition, how are you compering what once was japan's favorite manga, a series that moved the entire mdium and pretty much made what basketball is today in an entire country to some generic power level fujobait story.

If this rumor is true, which i fucking hope it is, it would be fucking huugee for such an influential series to get a worthy adaptation, the anime wasnt bad but the pacing was insufferable and the animation could be better.

I also wouldn't mind a complete redux a la Hunter x Hunter or Dragon Ball Kai.

Absolutely, if this rumor was true, which I doubt I dont see why they wouldnt just remake the entire thing, remakes are getting rather popular and they could cut all the 110 episodes into about 60 with better pacing and animation alltogether and contine with the story.

It's episodic for the most part. I don't think you'll lose all that much by just sticking to the movie, to be honest. The show is great and you'll definitely get a heavier dose of character development, but the movie (and its sequel) is a satisfying retelling of the core storyline.

I'll definitely give it a chance. All signs point to me liking it. Too much anime, and so little time
>> ARTICLE
The original incomplete Bubblegum Crisis beats Tokyo 2040 imo.
>> ARTICLE
Depends. Obviously animation as better on 2040, but let's sit that aside. While the original did a lot more with Priss (who is best character), it barely touched Celia, Lina, Leon, or Nene who got more development in the reboot.

On the other hand the original had Largo, the series' best villain hands down. 2040 had promise in characters like Mason, but never really did anything with it.

A very important question that could decide everything:

Is Ghost Stories the dub or sub version?
>> ARTICLE
Whichever you prefer. Not that I'd vote for either one. Even with the comedy dub, you're better off watching the youtube highlights of it than trying to actually watch all 20 episodes. Nothing could save that show.

Are you kidding? The dub is so damn good - so damn good that it saved the show. 
>> ARTICLE
Plus for god's sake, it's up against Vision of Escaflowne. Which is steampunk Gundam with dragons. And a solid romance, political intrigue, Yoko Kanno, and Maaya Gorram Sakamoto. 
>> ARTICLE
I always wanted to watch Vision of Escaflowne, but somebody told me it was girly. What's the verdict?
>> ARTICLE
OK, here's the thing.

Escaflowne was originally visioned as a shonen show, complete with action and violence and badass guys. Partway through development there were some hiatuses, and some staff changes, and new blood came in and decided it should have a more shoujo angle, with romance and pretty bishonen guys.

What came out was BOTH. At once. And it did so phenomenally. Escaflowne is a story about love, action, adventure, political machinations, war, death, and sacrifice; and it manages to appeal to both demographic groups while not losing anything. It literally stands in my top 5 favorite shows ever, and will unlikely ever be knocked out of that list. 

It definitely has girly parts; the lead character is a girl whose biggest concerns prior to the show were landing this guy she likes. But I'd recommend it to anyone. 

Just..do NOT watch the Fox Kids Dub. It never happened. And the movie is a separate continuity and...strange. Stick with the original TV series.

**Voting stats**: There was an average of about 650 people voting between the two rounds of elimination. People chose on average 12 titles each round. Assuming most of those 12 votes went toward the front runners, some of the lower ranked titles might have slipped into the competition with ridiculously few votes. 

Currently there are 118 voters in this round. On average, each user is voting in about 16 different matches. That's exactly half of the current 32 matches running right now.

I *would* have voted for it, if it had better voice-acting and a better soundtrack, but as it stands my nightmares are still haunted by awkward wah pedal guitar licks and tormenting cries of KIPPEI-ONII-CHAN.

I was also very close to voting for Ayakashi, but the poor directing in the first story left a really bad taste in my mouth, even though the second story was great (and, of course, the third one was absolutely phenomenal).

So hard to vote here T_T. I know almost everything reputation which should be enough right? Yea not really. Respectfully abstained from most of the voting with most of my votes aiding the underdog in certain landslides.

So many shows that I'm glade made it in. Sorta funny that ZZ made it in. I actually just finished it after waging war on it for weeks on end. It was satisfying but not even close to other UC titles in quality.

Elfen Lied... one of the stupidest animes I've completed watching.

Oh man. Round one and this already hurts.

* Bebop vs Tylor? The best episodic space series ever vs the third best sci-fi comedy anime? (behind Tenchi and Nadesico). That hurts.

* Lain vs Fushigi Yugi: Damnit do you WANT to give me an ulcer? Gotta give it to FY for my main man/girl Nuriko though.  
* I swear to god if Escaflowne loses because people vote for Ghost Stories due to its dub, I will hurt someone. Likely myself. 
* And there goes Mai-HIme. Too many people on this sub love planetes and have never seen HIme, probably.  
* And GX999 will lose to Love Hina. Which I can understand, it was like the textbook that all Harem Comedy since has been patterned after but...sigh.   
>> ARTICLE
I havent' seen Planates, but I have heard nothing but great things of it.  What I remember of Mai-HiME was the scooby doo reset ending, which i didn't care for.  I almost voted for it because of how cool robot girl with the modular weapons (including an S-Mart chainsaw) was.  Personally I liked Mai-Otome more, but it's endless sequels and spinoffs got kind of old.  
>> ARTICLE
> And there goes Mai-HIme. Too many people on this sub love planetes and have never seen HIme, probably.

Let's be honest. I've probably watched more shows on this list than the average /r/anime member, and there are very few match-ups where I watched both shows. That's the nature of the beast with a young fanbase and older shows.

Mai-HiME (that's how it's capitalized, BTW) and Planetes is one of the very few match-ups I watched both shows for. I like Mai-HiME considerably more, but Planetes is a better show. I voted for Mai-HiME, but I won't begrudge Planetes a win.
>> ARTICLE
A) Derp. I always screw that up.

B) To be fair it's "favorite anime" not "objectively  better" anime, so I can see voting for HiME over Planetes. And I did. Planetes was a great show, but HiME had me so worked up for the characters I would cheer or rage at my screen. Just...we don't talk about the asspull near the end, OK? That kinda almost killed the show for me.

But you outline part of why I think Planetes will win. You and I replying to each other here? Marks maybe the third time I've heard Mai-HiME even mentioned on this sub. Planetes gets brought up all the time (admittedly as "the show you haven't seen but should").
>> ARTICLE
Yup, Mai-HiME is barely mentioned. And yeah, I just ignore the ending for the most part. It actively undoes the show, but it's actually easy to ignore, all in all.

And yes, seeing Planetes mentioned by people who actually watched it isn't that common either.

Back when I used to give more recommendations, I'd recommend Planetes pretty often.
>> ARTICLE
The most interesting match-up is between Tutu and 12 Kingdoms, both fantastic shows, and I'm honestly not sure how it will turn out.

Also surprised about some of the ones that almost didn't make the cut. I thought shows like Nadia, Kamichu! and Tylor were more popular.

No fair, I loved Captain Tylor, but it is up against Bebop in the first round.  Lain vs Fushugi Yugi was tough to, mainly because FY was a fond memory of my early days of anime, but Lain is an all time favorite.  Also liked both Nedesico and GTO.  Ranma 1/2 vs ROLW was a tough one to.  ROLW OVA is one of the best fantasy anime ever created.  One of the few serious dramatic fantasy shows.  Usually they always end up as silly comedies.  Outlaw Star vs Rozen Maiden was another tough one.  Got to go with rule 27 It needs more DESU, and vote that way.  Really liked Nanoha, but Hikaru no Go is one of the best Shonen Jump anime ever, really under appreciated.  Haibane Renmei vs Boogiepop was probably the toughest call besides Bebop vs Tylor.  
>> ARTICLE
Wow, some harsh pairs like - Sakura vs Koi Kaze, Beck vs Negima. And vote for Digimon, guys. It's really awesome (sorry, I'm currently rewatching it that is why).

But I must admit that I've not seen a lot of title, barely 5 or so, even though I know a lot of them and had (or still having) intentions to watch some of them.

Don't make a fuss about it. From time to time, there's a grumpy old guy who pretends that everything was better before, and we make fun of his arguments by reminding him that Cutie Honey and Urusei Yatsura are not exactly recent. 

It's no big deal, just a recurring troll here and elsewhere. Heck, the idea that "everything was better before" is not recent, either.

Don't worry, a lot of us love moe and not-too-cheap fan-service. 
>> ARTICLE
[Relevant post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ila6c/before_railing_or_bitching_about_moe_or_todays/)

Many of us understand that anime is not going downhill because of moe/ecchi, but I agree that hearing people moan and groan about moe is annoying.
>> ARTICLE
>Compare that with Japan and the rest of Asia where stuff like Doraemon, Initial D, Ninja Boy, Kare Kano and Slam Dunk tend to be popular instead of Cowboy Bebop and GUndam Wing in the States.

I don't think Doraemon and Initial D count as "moe"...

Also, I think that many Western fans complain about the over saturation of  "moe"/fanservice/ecchi" because although initially western imported anime focused on the dark realm sci fi genre, today's imported anime generally falls into 3 categories: super high explosive battle shounen, moe/ecchi/hentai, trashy shoujo romance, in which 2 of the 3 focus on some form of moe.  Also, where sci fi animes generally have strong plots as their main point, "moe" anime in comparison focuses more on the beauty of the girls/guys and if the plot works, well then great.

**tr;dr** Anime imported to the states ARE getting saturated with more moe these days + differences in strengths of story driven anime vs. character glorifying anime 
>> ARTICLE
"I don't think Doraemon and Initial D count as "moe"

But they are stuff that most licensors think would never make it in the States.

You got a good point. THere is an oversaturation of moe in the market. But the thing about it is that what defines an anime as "moe" is pretty vague.

You said "where sci fi animes generally have strong plots as their main point," but moe is another factor for succesful sci-fi anime. It was Evangelion's Rei that kicked off moe as a whole. Ruri from Nadesico is a popular moe character. Mei from Darker than Black is a favourite moe character amongst /a/ and even Lin from Hokuto no Ken is proto-moe according to /a/nons.

"moe anime in comparison focuses more on the beauty of the girls/guys and if the plot works, well then great."

I think your description fits shoujo manga and anything written by Yuji Enokido though. Most moe anime have little regard for actual character designs. If they do, then the characters in yuru Yuri would have looked like the characters in Legend of the Galactic Heroes (although i wouldn't mind Yui and Kyouko looking like Yang Wenli and Julian Minci).
>> ARTICLE
>THere is an oversaturation of moe in the market. But the thing about it is that what defines an anime as "moe" is pretty vague.

No there is not sir. There is far to *little* moe in anime. In a perfect world, it would be almost everywhere.
>> ARTICLE
When I mean "Character driven" I don't mean character development, but rather the careful design of the character to the most "moe" potential either through visual elements (body proportions in both extremes, airbrushed girls ala denpa onna, etc) or character archetypes (ditz, quiet type, tsundere, yandere, etc).

There is certainly many different types of moe out there, but having elements of moe does not make an anime moe (just like a love interest in a movie does not equal a romantic film)

I completely agree that moe does help an anime's popularity but just feel like the twilight supernatural romance bandwagon, people are milking it way too much to make a quick buck
>> ARTICLE
>> I don't think Doraemon and Initial D count as "moe"

> So when stuff liek Azumanga Daioh, K-On! and Ouran made it to the States, many in the West kept complaining about the oversaturation of these shows

I don't think these shows are what people are complaining about. Really? Azumanga Daioh? Ouran? Please. When people talk about moe and ecchi killing the industry, they're talking about the success of shows like Infinite Stratos and Ro-Kyu-Bu, not Nichijou (which didn't sell that well) and Madoka (which was never meant to be, or was seen as, "girly shit"). 
>> ARTICLE
This comment = Yep.

Seriously were people ever complaining about shows like Ouran or Azumanga Daioh? Thats news to me...Its true that more "girly" shows seem to overall be less popular in the West but thats a whole seperate issue than the fanservice/ecchi drama.

Hell, I dont think people are hating even on the ecchi shows that have some other redeeming qualities...I think its mostly the ones that have no appeal or quality outside of crappy fanservice bs.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really know what to say, because I don't really like moe etc. but I understand what you're saying. That moe, echii, slice of life aren't ruining the industry, that they ARE the industry. 

I think it's mostly reddit people who dislike the moe etc. because they're usually older guys who saw Cowboy Bebop and FMA and loved that and only that. I've been on other websites where most western fans like all types of anime.

I just don't. I'm a lady, so I've liked things like Ouran, but slice of life/echii bores me. Is it because of the anime I was introduced to in America? Maybe.

Seriously. My favorite anime is One Piece. But I've talked to people who won't give it a chance because of the way Oda portrays women, and I really can't blame them.  
[This](http://www.onepiece.wikkii.net/w/images/thumb/1/10/SanjiFirstMeetNami.jpg/230px-SanjiFirstMeetNami.jpg) is Nami at the beginning of the series. [This](http://images.wikia.com/onepiece/images/0/07/Nami1.png) is her a few years later.

Edit: It's not just her either. [This](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100829231430/onepiece/images/b/be/Vivi_wednesday.PNG) is the character Vivi when she was actually a part of the story. [This](http://www.mangareader.net/one-piece/610) is the first picture of her after the timeskip.

Wow... I stopped watching after the "Skyland arc" and was somewhere in the manga near there too. I wanted to get back into the show, but seeing that is discouraging...
>> ARTICLE
See? This says nothing about the condition of the series at all. The female characters are not reduced to being mere sex symbols, he just draws them like that. But it's a huge turnoff for people. Skypeia is a horrible place to stop. It's a poorly-paced saga between Alabasta and the greatest saga of all of One Piece, the CP9 saga. If you bear through it, you won't regret it.
>> ARTICLE
Well I ended up stopping in one of the crappy fillers in the anime. That one with the sports competition or whatever. I wasn't even particularly disinterested or anything, I just got caught up in something else and forgot about it. Been meaning to pick it back up again but it's hard to get back into the middle of such a large show. One day...

Edit: Do you have any recommended subs? Might grab a few tonight actually. Or do you stick to the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Sports competition? You mean the Davyback Fight? The one with Foxy the Silverfox?  
Believe it or not, that's not filler. It's extended in the anime, so half of it is filler, but Foxy is actually an event that happens in the manga. It's a little breather between Skypeia and Water 7 so you're not constantly bombarded with serious.  
As for subs, you want Kaizoku Fansubs, hands down.
>> ARTICLE
Really? Felt a lot like filler just because of how it was mostly irrelevant to the plot. But like a said, it's not like I didn't like it or anything. Just got distracted. Will check out Kaizoku, thanks. :D
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah. Pretty much everybody who hasn't read the manga thinks that Foxy is filler, partially because they bring him back as a recurring filler character. Foxy basically becomes the Team Rocket of One Piece, although he's only reappeared two or three times so far.

I think everyone can agree with this to a certain extent, I don't mind an anime that has that one shower scene or that one beach episode, but it does get a bit annoying when they start overdoing it  *cough* Code Geass *cough*. I almost never have problems with moe characters though.

Sure, the American market has become broader and some people miss what the American market used to be. The people who complain about /that/ are blowing hot air.

But what and who exactly are you blaming? American licensing companies are at fault? That doesn't make much sense. We (Crunchyroll) try to license *everything* -- *everywhere*. Our available regions and anime selection are not things we try to limit. Taste only factors in when prioritizing how hard we push for certain series, because like all companies we have finite resources.

We license series all the time that are mediocre, or not "deep/intelligent/manly". Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi, a BL series, actually performed pretty decently, and if you look around you'll see plenty of shows that aren't particularly deep. If you think we're breeding people with a skewed perspective on anime you're just blaming the messenger. It's hard work to license as much as we do.

...And, by the way, we generally don't pass on licensing. The (prospective) licensors do. We've actually been declined an anime license before because a production company claimed that they didn't think people outside of Japan would watch it. When I heard about that from the licensing team it was a serious WTF moment.

And fans are accept***ing*** the likes of Nichijou and Madoka? Dude, so many of us have been open to that for years. If you think America has a skewed view of the Asian market, I'd say you have a skewed view of the American market.

You are so right it makes me sad. I got in to anime because I thought they were all like Cowboy Bebop. I reasoned that 'because it made it here, there must be more/better over there'.  
However, I have grown to love a much broader spectrum, see: Yuru Yuri :3  
I am still looking for the **my** next Bebop, and I really think that the search is fun and keeps me interested and trying new shows.

I like moe but not so much the ecchi stuff since as a straight lady it doesn't do much for me. I really enjoy slice of life and comedy, I'm really enjoying Nichijou and I loved Lucky Star, K-On, Azumanga, Ika musume...I really like cute stuff (almost a guilty pleasure) so the Moe stuff is fine by me so long as it's not too outlandish.
>> ARTICLE
>So i tend to blame Adult Swim, Toonami and licensing companies for creating an anime fandom based entirely on the belief that "all anime is deep/intelligent/manly"

FUCKING THIS. 

As an Asian person living in the West, I found it so weird that being a "true anime fan" would involve watching thought provoking shows/ action packed seinen anime etc. I'm one of the few people in Europe who appreciate the joys of just watching pure, adulterated, innocent, juvenile, serious, funny anime. Anime is not even supposed to be "deep". 

Upvotes for you and defending the moe culture! Come on Europe! Let's see more appreciation for Lupin III, Voltes V, Doraemon and Ouran High!

you think the problem with ecchi and fanservice is that it's "too girly" what?
>> ARTICLE
The idea that it is killing the industry is retarded because it's always been part of the industry and the industry's been doing just fine. However, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't complain about it. It's just like how people complain about Hollywood; oversexed and style-over-substance. Sure, it's always been that way, but that doesn't mean you're stupid for wanting to change it. 

Personally, I don't give a damn. Anime isn't real, it's a fantasy, and if the fantasy involves cute girls being sexy and cute, so what? If it's sexist then throw in some cute guys doing sexy and cute things. You look at the guys, I look at the girls, and we're both happy with this addition to our entertainment!
>> ARTICLE
I don't mind the moe so much as the echii. I don't think it's westerners as much as a generally some people don't enjoy the echii (I tend to avoid them seeing as they are usually the same plot in a different setting). 
>> ARTICLE
lol
>> ARTICLE
I only have a problem with ecchi/fanservice when it's used in an obviously irrelevant context just to bring interest. I don't even care if it's used on a show with low production values or generic plot. But when I see a good idea covered in fanservice for no reason I get frustrated.

Moe is basically its own genre at this point. If you're not interested, then it was probably not intended for you. People that complain about moe are the morons who go around YouTube bitching about Justin Beiber at EVERY opportunity.
>> ARTICLE
People who bitch about Beiber are middle schoolers who think they are being cool complaining about the singer the 12 year girls they know like.
>> ARTICLE
For me it's about the story and characters mainly. I've never really cared if the anime was well liked, I liked it and that was enough for me, I don't mind that I cry during Clannad and Clannad After Story. It's not about being a man for it's about being attached to the characters and their story, so if that means their tits are flopping around even though they're wearing bra's so be it!

Ouran High School Host Club is fucking splendid as hell, and I will throw my gauge before anyone that would differ. Blood will be spilled.

I think it has more to do with America's problem with showing any type of sexualization without getting up in arms about it. I'm sure for every fan that would crack up about a panty joke on Adult Swim, there are 10,000 more who would call into the station and demand the show stop being broadcast because it is "POISONING THE YOUTH OF AMERRRRKKKAAAAAA".

And in my experience, there are 2 types of anime fans in the West. One is the folks who grew up with Toonami and watched Dragon Ball Z all day, while the others were helping pioneer Bittorrent on sites like Animesuki and lurking in IRC using Bots.

Most people you find on the internet will be the later.
>> ARTICLE
There's a lot of difference inshows though. I love azumanga and lucky star, but I think k-on is garbage. There's a lot of stuff that is just gratuitous moe and that's fine if all you care about is how cute it is, but you have to have a good story or at least be hilarious to make up for it.  
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, the japanese marginalization of women is not a secret. I don't have a problem with an anime not being manly, as azumanga daioh is one of my favorite animes. I do however have a problem with women in anime being treated like objects, and if it means I have to disappoint a few scumbags by dulling the blade that is "moe", I don't think the industry would lose anything of value.
>> ARTICLE
I think the biggest fuss I have with the moe/ecchi/etc is the everything-has-to-be-cute art style.

I get it- Japan is the culture of cute, but don't shove it down my throat.

Shows like Madoka, Shugo Chara!, and Nichijou really have a golden ratio that mixes everything together well.

I don't really like shows like K-On! because they're not interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I think it shows the difference in culture preferences.

Not saying you're not entitled to your own though, just that it also gets annoying on our part (the cute-and-moe loving community) we hear constant complaints. 

I mean, anime is all about crossing all boundaries, right? It can be serious/funny, cute/action-drama. But being an ANIME FAN means you are able to at least appreciate all of the facets that come from Japanese shores. 

I've been an anime fan since I was 7, I am now 22. When I moved from Asia to Europe when I was 15, it saddened me that not all people can appreciate moe... not wrong though. I've made friends who like Gundam, Naruto, Death Note, Cowboy Bebop, Rurouni Kenshin. But I have yet to meet someone who also liked Doraemon, Slam Dunk, Mojacko. It's just... sad I can't share my love for the moe side of things.

The beauty of anime is that one doesn't have to watch every show. There's something for everyone.

Either way haters gonna hate.

My opinion on Inaho is that he wasn't even a decent MC before his death, for reasons that were already explained in a few other comments. I liked how he died because he had always been taking calculated risks, and it finally came back to bite him in the ass. It adds realism to a show which lacked it a bit, and it's also in line with Inaho's character. 

I'm torn on how this should affect the next cour, however. On the one hand, having Inaho dead opens things up for someone else like Slaine or the princess to take center stage and actually develop. On the other hand, there's no one left to play Slaine's foil, and Earth sucks without Inahobot. If Inaho was supposed to be interesting, there is no one left on the "good" side who is worth watching.

Of course, none of this would matter if Inaho miraculously survives/returns. If they go that route, there had better be a good explanation.

Midichlorians, naturally.
>> ARTICLE
Killing Inaho is probally the best marketing move i have seen in anime history. After ep 12 EVERYONE who watched anime was talking about it.

Complot theories, fuck Slaine, did the princess die?, did Ihano survive? Etc.
It really hyped the second season and boosted the popularity of the first season.

I really liked it, but i hope they won't do something like that often cause my heart will probally not take it.


>> ARTICLE
I shed mantears at the start of the flashback.
>> ARTICLE
While i agree it did both of those things, it is also taking a really big risk, and as it has been mentioned before, it puts the show on an interesting position. 
On the one hand they have to either play the "ohh they didnt die card" or risk people losing interest on the show by taking away the two main characters. Not only that but centering the show around one of the most hated characters of the year could also turn quite a few people off.
>> ARTICLE
After that ending I sat watching the credits and hearing that wind blowing in the hope that they would show something else afterwards to no avail. I was just a black screen with the sound of wind. I like Inaho I felt like he was a brilliant tactician, finding the kataphracts weaknesses while the rest of the military was just futilely.
>> ARTICLE
When I saw the ending I was like bruh. For 5 minutes just staring at the tv and wondering what just happen
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's wrong to call Inaho emotionless. Inaho is a kuudere, like Rei Ayanami who is also often called emotionless. Inaho has a lot of emotions, he just doesn't express them very well. I've never had a problem with him not speak much or him being the silent, calculated badass. The central writing problem with Inaho's character is that it's never explained why he's so quiet and dedicated. Sure his parent have died, but that was never elaborated on. I would like Inaho so much more if he was given a more in-depth backstory explaining what has traumatized him into being so withdrawn and afraid to express his emotions. I enjoy Inaho, but I would've liked him and the show so much more if he had more development.
>> ARTICLE
you don't use that word to describe Inaho.

Would you rather a Tsundere?

Do you have a reason why not? He fits the trope rather well.

I thought they were going to but with how much was in the first cour it would be hard to add an explanation and still end at the same point in the story, they still might have an explanation in the second cour though.
>> ARTICLE
I think they could've used some of the time they spent developing Marito to develop Inaho more. I feel they spent more time than necessary on Marito and not a lot has really come of it so far. The time would've been much better spent developing Inaho, the driving force of the story.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I agree, Marito didn't have much to do with the story
>> ARTICLE
I liked the ending of AZ and for the same reasons, that it gave inaho some depth with that last smile and a tragic end.  And I apologize for the subsequent ramble.....

But yo Inaho is a "pretty shitty" MC. goddamn where do I start with this bitch. As someone who empathizes with the logical and calculated characters who rarely display emotion and often make hard decisions, Inaho is lacking like really lacking when compared to its epitome, rossiu from TTGL. Well what do we know about Inaho....he's an emotionless genius and likes eggs,that isnt a "character" its a bunch of quirks in human form. Really thats quite an oversimplification, but there's practically no development of character at all ( except for the ending when he smiles at hime). Even if there is its brief showcased in seconds and extremely subtle. And no that's not character depth its bad writing. Every episode I'm left wanting more outta him, and I'm left disappointed when compared to his emotion filled counter part slaine who actually develops as a character and has clear motivations(his whole world revolves around the princess whereas inaho's revolves around eggs, idk he hasn't shown any desire other than that has he...). Watching Inaho talk about doing the "logical" thing is like being told your drinking a complex soup with subtle flavors and all I taste is boiled salt water.

His feelings toward the war and the other characters are dependent on "logic" at least that's what the show is calling it. Well whats is his logic survival of the human race/ survival of terrans /survival of his friends /survival of his sister / survival of eggs? what does he want ,why does he fight, what are his priorites saving the world or his friends?... Its implied that he cares for his friends and family but damn most of the time bitch doesn't give a flying fuck about anything going on the entire show, just goes into his robot despite everybody's objections (most of them are practically have no idea what they're doing anyway ) and just beats the (insert pissed of martian antagonist of the week here) with an understanding of high school physics. Yes I'm attributing his intelligent feats of robo destruction to physics(Something about barriers and different waves, heat conversion, changing molecular density, ultimate combo). He observes a phenomenon grasps whats happening apply it in a way detrimental to (insert pissed of martian antagonist of the week here) and viola you've got a recipe for a badass inaho. Now all you need is a kickass ost to build a hype train. And everybody just kinda goes along with it cuz you know why the fuck not, its trending right now to let the MC go out and solo the martian super robot in his orange trainee one because y'know plot armour and such(increasing the WTFucks of the last episode). This practice frankly is quite immersion breaking if shounen protags often have the problem of plot armour due to nakama last minute powerup, then Inaho's ability to just wreck everything in a trainee robot due to "badassery" is like a godmode thats constantly on which is really cheap.

Yes I do realise I'm shitting pretty hard of everyone's favourite series the last season but I had a bunch of pent up disappointment with this series that I've been repressing and it just happened to show its face in this post.  I'm not really sure why I'm super critical to AZ compared to the other seasonal animes, but I'm attributing it to it being this massively hyped series with an awesome setting/ ost /art/atmosphere and just squandering that with the mediocrity of the characters and plot. That being said I enjoyed the ending due to shock value and stuff but damn there's no way slaine can carry the entire second half by himself, despite my disappointment I'd rather Inaho be alive so he can get some freaking development , internal conflict resolution. Its an interplanetary war its supposed to be alot more tragic than it is.....I'm not the most confident about part 2 but theres still potential to mindblow if its written well.

That being said there's no right/wrong ans and if anyone thinks that inaho is and awesomely deep character and slaine sucks balls and should die, right on man . You do fucking you, I'm not some elitist snob trying to change or dispute anyone's beliefs over here. Especially OP who likes Inaho for the very reasons I think he's lacking. (lol not gonna lie I slightly chuckled when he got shot, but like you fans out there I think it'd be better if he were actually alive )

Inaho's death is a weird one. On the one hand I was glad because he is a terrible MC and by getting rid of him I thought the show could move on. 
But by killing him before he got any real development stunts his character. I was never given the chance to care for him, to learn why he acted in his own manner, and to see him change over the course of the series. The ending was all drama and no substance.
>> ARTICLE
Inaho is the least normal person imaginable. If your best friend dies in front of your eyes you don't react by asking for your pajamas to be ready. Plus since he is the only one (not) acting like that in the show, it sticks out way too much and feels out of place. 

Also he is most likely not dead. The ending was a cliffhanger done to keep us interested to watch more.
>> ARTICLE
I have no strong feelings on Inaho as an MC, but I now worry about season 2.  Who's going to be the MC?  Fucking Slaine?  Ew.

They could make it about his sister, but a lot of her appeal was interacting with her brother.  Inko?  She's nothing more than Inaho's fangirl.  The midget isn't MC material and the redhead had her character arc wrapped up fairly well.  There are other side characters and they can always introduce someone new, but I kind of hope they just go with surgical miracle.

If only one survives the other might snap and go on a rampage, but that's just my pipe dream.

Mostly I wanna see Slaine off himself.  Never really considered him a person anyway.
>> ARTICLE
And why not the PTSD guy ?

I mean he may have some link with Slaine's father and we can have some side story about it.

Him trying to get in a mecha again, kicking Slaine's ass, please !

I guess it could work, but it would feel weird jumping to someone totally different (though I guess that will be true no matter who they replace inaho with assuming they really have killed them off for realsies).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Inaho, even if people hated/loved him, was doing his job as a MC, now that he is dead the transition to the other MC will sure be difficult.

Let's just hope they do not destroy the whole show just for making Slaine the MC.
>> ARTICLE
I ~~may be one of the few people who~~ (edit: I take that back, seems many people feel the same as I do) watched that show to completion but actually really didn't care about the ending one way or the other.

Frankly I found all the main characters (princess, mr. bland, mr. blands sister, and mr. blands childhood friend who clearly has a crush on him) rather dull.   
The only exception is Slane, slane was brilliantly written - all the best intentions, but abused and twisted by the horrors of war and all too human emotions of jealousy, envy and unrequited love with conflicting loyalties to that love and his duty as a soldier. An almost perfect execution of a character you love, then love/hate, then just hate.

Aldnoah.zero had a great world, a really nice premixe, great animation and some utterly brilliantly written side characters - by every single one of the main characters was a dull cut-out shallow.

I utterly disagree with you that Inaho was "human", and that 30 second appeal to emotion during his death didn't do enough to change my mind.  

Saazbaum, Cruhtea and Marito (mr. PTSD) were all vastly more interestingly written than any of the younger cast members.

The Princesses "character progression" was literally the generic princess progression done hundreds of times in hundreds of tales - the tale of the sheltered princess who comes to understand that the world is more complex and dark than her simplistic childish views.   
As for Inaho, sorry but the occasional comment from his sister, and that flashback were not enough to make me care a damn about the character. 

Frankly he seemed like a high functioning autistic child - and I could have forgiven the character a lot more if that were revealed to be the case, but I still would not *care* about him.

I'm not saying they needed to make him cry, or spout his feelings, or overly emote like some shitty shonen MC - but they needed to focus in no details to show he had something going on in his brain beyond pure logic. The flashback was a good attempt at this but too little too late - they needed much more than that throughout the series.    
Because as it stood I simply didn't care when he died - he was nothing more than a background NPC compared to the adult cast.


>> ARTICLE
Inaho is an empty shell with 0 personality and a few desirable traits (genius, capable mecha pilot...), so the average viewer can project his own personality at him and say "Oh hey look he is just your everyday normal person, just like ME".

Sleazy marketing technique combined with lazy writing. And sadly I am not his sister to magically capture every single nuance of his amazing personality so I would have appreciated if the writers actually gave a sh*t considering he was supposed to be the main character.

I also love the fact that before the second encounter instead of formulating a battle plan around the reactive armor (which wasn't some makeshift armour, but a standard-issue military equipment) he kept the information for himself, let his comrades die and risked everyone else's lives on the ship. And thats just one example among his many qualities.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to jump on this and say: I love Slaine as a character. I hate what he did and I hate him but he's a good, consistent character. One of the big complaints I saw (and still see) is that Slaine's actions were "strange" or "out of character." They weren't. They were *perfectly* in character. Slaine doesn't think, and he acts emotionally. Hence his actions in the last episode. He's well written and a good character, if decidedly hate-able.

Go with Rose, we don't need wolves running around here.  I don't care how attached you are, they're still wolves.

Oh no, Kamichu! I am so sorry you have to go against Dragon Ball. :(

All my favourite SoLs are dying in this game.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else shocked that Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha was eliminated this early? Great show, and I thought it was super popular.
>> ARTICLE
Well, no surpri--

Wait, Excel Saga lost to Beyblade?  Dafuq people.

This bracket:

- Gundam 08th MS Team v. G Gundam

If G Gundam wins this I am going to roll over the floor laughing my ass off.  I'm already giggling imagining the salt.

- Macross v. Tenchi

I'm rather curious who's going to win there.

- Azumanga Daioh v. KGNE

I suspect KGNE is going to get crushed by Moecom.  T_T.

- Dragonball GT v. Crest of the Stars

Crest of the Stars better win this or I'm gonna flip some tables.

I don't know whether I'm surprised Ranma beat out Lodoss War, but I am disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
The granddady of harem comedy against what is very literally some dude animating his D&D campaign? Don't get me wrong I love Lodoss, but it didn't stand a chance. 
>> ARTICLE
Monster Rancher already lost? Man I loved that show.....well......love**d** . That was so long ago. I almost can't remember anything. Maybe it was really shit....
>> ARTICLE
G Gundam vs 08th MS Team was really hard to decide. They kind of represent opposite ends of the Gundam spectrum, in terms of seriousness and design. Ended up voting for G Gundam, because this hand of mine glows with an awesome power.
>> ARTICLE
Aww shit, Zoids lost but I still have a lot of contenders in the competition. Is it me or there are very few people in this contest compared o the greatest anime of all time and best guy contests?
>> ARTICLE
This is the fourth one I've run, and none of them have been very popular. I try to do a good job running them, keep them moving along smoothly, and make them interesting, but they never make it to the top. Heh, I even made [banners](http://i.cubeupload.com/yvWsLy.jpg) for each of the contestants in the [last tournament](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2l0sc9/greatest_year_of_anime_tournament_final_results/).

I knew this one wouldn't be that popular either considering the average age of the members of /r/anime. I like old anime though, so I ran with it anyway. I'm glad that it at least spends some time on the front page, even if it does get overshadowed by all the other contests going on.
>> ARTICLE
Too bad since a lot of these "old" shows are really amazing. I'm really looking forward to see how this ends. Keep up the great work!
>> ARTICLE
* Sigh. Bebop beat Tylor. I wish I could say I was surprised, but I doubt half the people here have even HEARD of it. Go watch it, you heathens.  
* FY Got REKT. Damn.  
* Fruits Basket beat the no 1 reason why CLAMP is amazing? I..I..I..SALT!  
* Nadesico, the best sci fi comedy ever made, lost. At least it was to GTO, But I'm betting the major reason is because none of you ever SAW Nadesico.  
* BeyBlade beat...ANYTHING? But especially Excel? Ugh. 
* Oh thank god Escaflowne won...but YYH is gonna beat it next round probably. Meh.  

Today's round:

* You neanderthals better vote for Yamato.  
* There goes Scrapped Princess...
* Kenshin vs Tenjo Tenge? Awww...Not a contest, but I'm sad, because I still like TenTen even if I'm definitely not voting for it.  
* Gantz is gonna beat Noir cause betting no one here ever saw Noir...  
* Nadia vs SAC. You ARE trying to kill me!  
* and 08th MS vs G Gundam. That's not even fair. 
* There goes Rayearth, because bet most of you never even heard of it...  
* And Crest of the Stars, one of the best scifi epic/romances, is up against the 80000lb Saiyan Gorilla. Fuck.  
* And there goes Abenobashi..man all my old faves are gonna die here... 
* Tenchi. Versus. Macross. You...bastards. Ouch. My heart.  

I'm not even salty. I'm bitter. And sad. And old. 
>> ARTICLE
Sadly X/1999 was against the biggest romcom of it's time.

But I do agree with you with everything. Especially Noir and Excel being beat by Bayblades (of all things).
>> ARTICLE
The X anime adaptation is average at best, the manga is where it's at, and of course, we still have Card Captor Sakura!!!
>> ARTICLE
I'd have to agree that the manga was infinitely better than any other adaptation. If only the were ever planning on finishing it...
>> ARTICLE
I read somewhere that they do have the intention of finishing it, only the intention...
>> ARTICLE
I think the last chapter came out like a decade ago. I'm not holding my breath.

Actually I just checked. Chapter 18, the last one published, was done in 2002, came to the US in 2005. So it's been 13 years. 
>> ARTICLE
Crest of the Stars is going to get wrecked unfortunately. And Rose of Versailles deserves better too. I gotta say that Gankutsuou is getting my vote over Yamato. And I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop a whole lot more than Tylor...although that was a really laughable result for Tylor
>> ARTICLE
I never liked Rose, which is hilarious because I'm a huge Utena fan and that show blatantly stole from Rose so hard it's not funny. Plus it's up against Wolf's Rain, which was just great.

Bebop is a MUCH better show overall in terms of story and quality, but Tylor's insanely funny. It's the better comedy.

And meh. I just don't like Count. But that's a personal gripe, the weird art style scared me off after like 2 episodes. It was too distracting. Plus it doesn't hurt Yamato (well Star Blazers) is literally the first anime I ever saw, and the reason I'm even here. 


>> ARTICLE
Tylor is funnier, but I didn't find it to be as consistently funny as most people. So, I felt Cowboy Bebop is better at what it aims to be. 

I'm actually a Rose fan, but not much of a Utena or Wolf's Rain fan. Go figure. Gankutsuou threw me off with its style but I grew on me, and now I look on it very fondly.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm bitter. And sad. And old. 

Pretty much how I feel every day around here. Although that BeyBlade victory means I have enough salt for an entire month's worth of margaritas.
>> ARTICLE
*Fruits Basket* was adorable, and Toru Honda is the dere-dere of dere-deres, opposite the quintessential male tsundere in Kyo.  I'm not even sure whether that was the movie or series version of *X*, but it had no right to beat *FB*.*Excel* losing to *Beyblade,* though... I might have to cook my ~~dog~~ emergency rations in protest.
>> ARTICLE
I assumed X the TV series. Which was a monster of a fantasy/magic epic with amazing designs and music, and a giant cast of memorable characters. 

This may also boil down to genre preference. I'm not gonna like; I'm not much for rom-coms, much less cutesy ones. 
>> ARTICLE
Were the character designs markedly different from the movie?  I never cared for CLAMP's typical overlong bodies/limbs.
>> ARTICLE
Nooooope. Noodles, Noodles everywhere.

That's one of those things you either like or you don't. I fell in love with their manga art back when I was a kid.

Are you kidding me? Cowboy Bebop was the only anime to beat Pokemon in terms of votes
>> ARTICLE
Welp, there goes *Hikaru no Go...* :'(
>> ARTICLE
Here's to hoping Kino's Journey makes it through.
>> ARTICLE
It has my vote. Nothing against Big O, but Kino's just on another level. It has some of the most memorable episodes in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh, I wanted *Witch Hunter Robin* to beat *Big O* last round...
>> ARTICLE
Berserk vs Initial D? Its too early for this shit >:/
>> ARTICLE
Ooh ooh so excited...let's see...

* You troglodytes..No love for Yamato?  
* Toldja Noir would lose...closer than I thought though.  
* Aw, Macross beat Tenchi. I mean, it's totally fair I can see why, but that makes me sad. Tenchi is one of my favorite shows ever.  
* Wow, Crest put up a good fight. I'm happy to see that. 

Today's Bracket:

* Kino's Vs Big O? That should get interesting. 
* Ah! Megami-sama is about to get rekt..sadness.  
* There goes Slayers...  
* And Escaflowne...damnit.  

>> ARTICLE
That Slayers vote was painful. :/

Agree about Escaflowne. Nothing against Yu Yu, but I think Escaflowne is the better show and I don't see it standing much of a chance. It's rarely mentioned here.

Noir losing was a shame too. Underrated imho.

Agree on Tenchi, still a classic!

Ye olde cave-dwellers of r/anime...

Really hoping initial D will survive this round. Come on, show some love, guys ;_;

If it gets knocked out we should make a "best racing anime of all time" contest, then it would reign supreme!

I'd be totally okay with that.

Except there are a surprising amount of contenders...

I'm curious, I can only think of a few off the top of my head.

Wanganm midnight, eX-driver (I kinda like this one), heck even Akira counts, F1 anime, uhhhhhhhh what else... let's and go, a few more I can't recall right now...

Yeah, me too, and even more after it lost in the first round of Favorite Anime of All Time, but Berserk...
>> ARTICLE
Not against *Berserk,* no way.

Yeah, fuck this shit mang. How is this even a fair fight?

Well, I guess that's the end for Princess Tutu. It had a good run, but I'm guessing there are way more voters who have seen Lain.

Some of these votes makes no sense to me I clearly remember some of the shows that lost being extremely popular when they came out.

Slayers is as entertaining for 78 episodes as Trigun is for 26. The hardest vote for me so far.

* Redline
* Berserk

Thank you, looking into Redline right now!

Something *really* manly you might want to look into would be Boku no Pico. It has everything a real man would love and enjoy; the pinnacle of "manime" if you will. Be sure to stick through all the episodes because it just gets better as you go along.
>> ARTICLE
I am in agreement with Sir RayLeeMental. He has fine taste in manime, and as such I second his suggestion.
>> ARTICLE
Boku no Pico may just be the manliest anime out there; a fine suggestion.
>> ARTICLE
I did some research, it seems that /r/anime has been playing a trick on me...

...

...by keeping this amazing show a secret.

I'll start torrenting it now so that when I come back from the gym tomorrow I'll be sweaty, covered in olive oil, and in the mood. Thanks, guys!

New Getter Robo.  A Go Nagai creation animated by Brain's Base, what more could you possibly ask for?  The "protagonists" are all psychopathic homicidal maniacs who are vindicated only by their raw manliness and the fact that they are fighting zombie demons.

Definitely hoping that LoGH wins, but it's probably gonna be Bebop or Evangelion.
>> ARTICLE
You say that but Heidi's on that list and it's gonna demolish the competition.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but I've never heard of that show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah most people on the sub probably haven't. It's just too old. And it's nothing special by itself really, just an anime that's more like an actual cartoon for kids. It's just that it's one of the precursors of the era  and since it was a success abroad, it is very famous among many adults as something from their infancy. A true classic in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
That might be, but if it's unpopular it's gonna lose, sadly.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's kind of a waste that nothing else even stands a chance.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I've only seen about 20 of these. I feel like a complete noob.

No need to, a lot of people are new to anime, I've been watching for 11 years and I've not seen even half of these.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen pokemon at some point, and a few episodes of digimon 10 years ago. Get on my level.
>> ARTICLE
My votes for a lot of the matches.

**Bebop** VS Green Legend Ran - I adore both of them, but Bebop's on another level. Tough luck for Ran. It really is a great sci-fi.

Rose of Versailles VS Infinite Ryvius - Infinite Ryvius has some of my favorite characters. It's really strong on the character development front. I haven't seen Rose, but I can't imagine it being better.

**Castle in the Sky** VS Cities of Gold - Only partway into Cities, but the first few episodes haven't impressed. Going to vote on the Ghibli classic.

Nausicaa VS **A Wind Named Amnesia** - I'm probably going with the worse choice, but I doubt anyone else will vote for it, and I did enjoy watching it.

Sakura VS Dear Brother - Ouch, another one of my favorites going against a powerhouse. ;_;

Outlaw Star VS **Anne of Green Gables** - One of my favorite shoujos. They really gave Anne a tremendous amount of personality.

Slayers VS **Blue Submarine** - Slayers has the better characters, but Blue Submarine has the better story.

Barefoot Gen VS **Future Boy Conan** - Toughest choice yet. Gen had the bigger effect on me, but Conan is definitely the more enjoyable watch. The animation in that is amazing considering it's from the 70's.  

Pokemon VS **The Door into Summer** - Heh, it doesn't stand a chance over the nostalgia monster, but it was a hell of an interesting movie. Forbidden love always makes for an interesting story.

**Porco Rosso** VS Nemo - Another solid entry from Ghibli. If you have kids, they'll love Nemo though.

**Galaxy Express 999** VS The Dog of Flanders - Tough choice. A little more substance in the former.

**Dragonball** VS Venus Wars - I'm usually a sucker for sci-fi like Venus Wars, but it felt very hit an miss. Dragonball was just plain funny. 

**Princess Mononoke** VS A Little Princess Sara - My second favorite Ghibli film! I did like Sara, but not as much as some other WMT series. It's another riches to ruins story. Lots of drama and suffering. Sara was a bit *too* perfect for me though.

**My Neighbor Totoro** VS Memories - Another unfortunate match up. I think Memories could win against a lot of this list, but not Totoro.

**Escaflowne** VS Yokohama - My favorite mech of all time! Yokohama's more like an art house film. I rated both highly, but I enjoyed Escaflowne a lot more.

Akira VS **My Daddy Long Legs** - Judy is one of my top 10 favorite female characters ever! Akira's going to win this one easily, but at least I was able to put in one vote for the opponent.

Fist of the North Star VS **Yawara**  - FotNS just wasn't my thing. I guess I'm not into GAR

His and Her Circumstances VS **Romeo and the Black Bros** - If the former had more than 10 frames per episode, and if it wasn't 25% recaps, and if it had even a slightly decent ending, it'd have my vote. Romeo was good, but it suffered from the same problem that A Little Princess Sara had, in so much as Romeo had no character flaws at all.

**YuYu Hakusho** VS Wings of Honey Mayonnaise - Yuyu didn't have great writing, but it was damn entertaining. Wings had some amazing animation, but it fails to really capture your full attention. I will say that Wings has one of the most disturbing scenes in anime.

Here's a tip for future reference OP, since this is a new contest and no doubt a lot of people have different interpretations on what's a classic can you include a description part which properly describes what series classify?

Seriously though, Blue Submarine No. 6 has been in my top 3 since I first saw it on Toonami in 2000. It's a short, great series. It does have it's downfalls like it's pacing issues and lack of explanations, but I still think it's a damn fine series!


Oh, and the [OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83TzooHQ3ps&list=PL97B8E6E4ED00FBA2) is fucking phenomenal.

Different time range and it was only open to television series.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely a good list of anime. I've seen 67/128 of them, and I've enjoyed most of them. Topics haven't been trending very well, so I don't expect many votes. However that just means that your vote is just that much more important. I imagine a lot of these matches will be very close.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen 27/128, but they only make 3/64 pairs. I don't feel qualified to vote at all lol.
>> ARTICLE
Rose of Versailles vs Infinite Ryvius on the first round is sinister, but great list overall. what was the cutoff year for this? 2000?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it had to finish airing in 2000 or earlier.
>> ARTICLE
I think I've only seen like 2 of these.  I should really watch more of the classics.
>> ARTICLE
Ouch. Not happy about having to choose between *Perfect Blue* and *Gunnm* in the first round.
>> ARTICLE
Lodoss vs Nadia will be a tough one.

Yamato vs Area 88 OVA will be also interesting. Area 88 is really good but Yamato maybe has advantage in the eyes of the fans for it's very successful reboot version.

Berserk vs Candy Candy - talking about polar opposites. While Candy Candy is the first anime series that was shown in my country (not entirely sure) and will forever remain a positive experience of my childhood memories, I have to give vote for Berserk, the best dark fantasy anime although it isn't complete.

Outlaw Star vs Anne of the Green Gables - I really don't want Anne to go out so early, but it seems that it will probably lose this one.
>> ARTICLE
Digimon! Digimon! Digimon! (Just kidding, who even watched that?)

Looks like I missed the elimination round. I'm a bit disappointed and surprised that Touch didn't make it into the main tournament. I would think Touch to be a much more well known title than some of the ones that made it.

Surprised me as well. I wish I knew how to view the vote counts for the elimination round, so I could see which shows just missed the cutoff.
>> ARTICLE
No Inuyasha :L

Too recent.

Are these all from before 2000?

The shows could air in 2000, but no later. Basically just 20th century.

Thats... a whole lot of stuff that only a handful of people on this sub might have heard of much less seen. I don't even think it's all subbed either. 
>> ARTICLE
Fairly certain they all have subs. They might not all have great subs (Anonymous Russian Rippers bleh!), but they're all fairly easy to download and watch. 
>> ARTICLE
If Slam Dunk's inside this competition I feel that Captain Tsubasa should be too. It's a classic as much as SD.
>> ARTICLE
Should have nominated it then.
>> ARTICLE
I missed the nomination period :( Would've nominated touch and h2 too
>> ARTICLE
Touch was actually nominated. You can find it in the [full character list](http://animebracket.com/characters/classic-anime-tournament-favorite-anime-of-the-20th-century/). I was surprised it didn't get enough votes to make it through the elimination round. It's fairly well known.
>> ARTICLE
When looking at the results page, the number is the over-all voting rank, right? Because there's no way something like Cowboy Bebop has only 1 vote.

The number is the anime's seed in the tournament. Think of it like the NCAA basketball tournament. The 1 seeds are the best teams.

Log Horizon's opening is one of the few I sit through every time. I always loved how the OP essentially drowns you in characters. The second season's OP is the same, only with even more of them.

Parasyte's (Kiseijuu) opening is also pretty damn good.

Black lagoon : 
guy gets held hostage by modern sea highjackers and ends up a part of their crew. Amazing show, hype as fuck, and INCREDIBLE stories with lots of gore and character development. One of my all time faves

Durarara: 
Its about a gang called the dollars and a mythical chick who is trying to find her head. Prob hands down the best anime on crunchyroll.

FMAB: 
Like cmon....fullmetal should be on everyones list

The melancholy of haruhi suzumiya:
A cynical guy named kyon becomes friends with the weirdest chick on the planet who happens to be the creator and god of the universe whos every single desire comes true but is completely oblivious and kyon, an android, time traveler and esper are all aware that shes practically god and have to make sure she never knows.

Steins gate:
A guy figures out for to time travel but something crazy happens and tries to fix it by time travelling

Cowboy bebop:
Objectively the greatest anime of all time. Just watch it, if someone calls themselves an anime fan and hasnt seen it i dont take them seriously when they talk about anime.

Neon genesis evangelion:
You have to watch this, even if you dont like it youre not really credible as an anime fan if you havent. A kid named shinji is forced to pilot a mech called Evas to fight off angels then becomes a mind fuck.



>> ARTICLE
Parasyte is on crunchyroll.
>> ARTICLE
Durarara is much better than parasyte
>> ARTICLE
> Put up an argument for the one you would recommend the most out of this list.

Check out NGNL!

The art/animation is pretty (and purple), the concept is intriguing (games galore), and the show is insanely fun (episode six is an episode you will never forget). :3
>> ARTICLE
It's not gory but man if you haven't seen it you gotta check out [Durarara!!] (https://youtu.be/_O9hRcIAza0) that show ia phenomenal I just started it like in the beginning of this month and I'm already up to being ready for the new season coming this spring. But if you like gory I suggest [Hellsing Ultimate] (https://youtu.be/0T0z-xMp908) I also suggest [Samurai Champloo] (https://youtu.be/4OuRajFzMYI) but sorry I don't know much about the goryer series but those are just a few series I find to be VERY good.
>> ARTICLE
> I liked SAO and Log Horizon is probably up there for my favorites.

DanMachi, Overlord and NGNL should be your top priority then.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to give you a few reasons to remove some of these off your list.

DanMachi - A carbon copy of SAO, except weaker in every single aspect.

Btooom! - Another SAO copy except you might actually get a kick out of the bomberman-esque battles. Terrible characters though. Not a single good one.

Fairy Tail - The amalgam of every overused battle shounen cliche in existence. Honestly not even worth staying for the fights. There's better shows with better animation.

From your list, I would say Overlord and NGNL are fun watches. I've heard great things about Slam Dunk too.

Now, I would like to add to your list. Two of these in particular are quite gory.

[Jojo's Bizarre Adventure](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14719/)

[Hunter x Hunter (2011)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/)

[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/)
>> ARTICLE
Btooom! an SAO copy? Okay.
>> ARTICLE
OP MC. An avid gamer that's suddenly trapped in a real life version of the game he's good at (#1 in the world).

Tsundere female lead that falls for him (and so easy too). Bonus attempted rape scene.

Pseudo-threat of death. (Because plot-armor)


>> ARTICLE
Lol what? She doesn't even properly fall for him until the end. And they knew each other before they even got thrown into the "actual real life game" She almost got fucking raped dude what do you expect? Of course she's angry. He has plot armor because the people hosting the game are doing experiments and are streaming it to other people. If everybody died straight away what good would the game be?
>> ARTICLE
I agree with everything you just said. Because everything you just said can and has been used to argue why the story is terrible.
>> ARTICLE
Yes i agree that the plot sucks, it's still interesting though. But in my honest opinion i do not believe the show to be plot centered. Instead i think it relies on it's themes and intriguingly accurate representation of the "what if i could" human conception. It also accurately represents how most people would act and think in those situations. And that's why i enjoyed Btooom!
>> ARTICLE
I've seen those 3 you recommended, Jojo is one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Nice nice. Okay, not letting you go empty-handed though. Here's some amazing series that are a bit more obscure stuff. I also recommend putting a My Anime List together so we know what you've seen.

[Kyousougiga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/) (Skip episode 0)

[Dennou Coil](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2164/)

[Kara no Kyoukai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2593/)




>> ARTICLE
* Fairy Tail

Follow Natsu (who actually isn't the protagonist, funny enough), who's a member of the guild Fairy Tail, as they tackle their daily lives various quests, internal struggles in the guild along with external trouble they have to deal with as it shows itself. 

Watch them grow, fight and become better friends. Friends are the keyword for this anime.

A lot of people don't like it, I've followed it since the beginning and think it's good.

As the recommendation chart also calls it:

My Little Wizards, Friendship is Magic.

* DanMachi

Follow this completely ordinary white haired kid (whose only reason to stand out is his white hair) get a harem meanwhile dungeoneering and moaning about his lack of ability and fauning towards the girls. Oh, he also is member of a breast god, Breastia, whose sole reason for being in the anime is to show off a ribbon never mentioned in the LN.

In all seriousness though. It follows Bell, a boy who just came to this huge town where there's a dungeon. You follow him trying to level up while also trying to make a living for his tiny guild only consisting of him and his Goddess Hestia. Bell is clueless towards girls, and there's only two things he thinks about.

1. Girls

2. Get stronger for girls.

* No Game No Life

Ever wanted to live in a world where everything was ruled by games? No killings, theft or rape? Sora and Shiro is a pair of gamer siblings, the meanest pair of Otaku/weeabo you can think of. In the gaming world they're known as "[ ]" and has never been defeated in game.

These siblings find themselves wishing to be in a world where everything was like a game. Somehow (I won't spoil how) they end up in this realm where everything is ruled by games, and now they have to fend for themselves there.

Mind you, everything I've written so far, is only the 1st or maybe 2nd episode... It's long since I've seen it last.
>> ARTICLE
DanMachi is pretty alright. Lots of fanservice, but when it gets good, it gets really good. Not the 'gory shit' you're looking for, at least not constantly (there's a few scenes), but it's still pretty cool. 

Just picture SAO, but it's not actually a game, it's real life. It's about [a guy](http://pm1.narvii.com/5772/906ea6c2a71439614d10f7181ef848cfee7b2e67_hq.jpg) going through a seemingly bottomless dungeon, and then coming back to [His one and only goddess Hestia](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCT1vtuW8AAy97U.jpg) to level up, and it's really a fun anime.
>> ARTICLE
Oh that's what Hestia is from? 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, DanMachi was popular on release, especially Hestia, and everyone's waiting for the second season. 
>> ARTICLE
Are we expecting an S2 for DanMachi? That's news to me, but I haven't followed it at all since the show ending.
>> ARTICLE
I have no clue, I'm just being hopeful/
>> ARTICLE
they got the $$$, the business model, the marketing set up, name recognition, and the endless source of connections to make them work. they've been playing the long game and have everything sorted out, ever since the 60's, when they basically brought to the mainstream the foundations for long-running shounen action shows, mecha anime, and mahou shoujo, among other things.  
>> ARTICLE
Yeah agreed...But then by this do you mean Toei Animation is on decline this recent years??

Only World Trigger is the significant anime I have seen this year I think :-D
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if I'd say they were in decline. over the last ten years they've given us some really solid shows that have nothing to do with any of their flagships, like [Lovely Complex](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2034/Lovely%E2%98%85Complex), [Mononoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2246/Mononoke), [Kuuchuu Buranko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6774/Kuuchuu_Buranko), [Kyousogiga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_(TV\)), and [Heartcatch Precure](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7645/Heartcatch_Precure!), all of which are considered among the cream of the crop in recent years and were massive critical successes (if not commercial successes). I think they don't care about the handling of their bigger titles since they sort of sell themselves, and if quality drops in DBS or Sailor Moon Crystal means they can produce something wonderfully weird and different like [Expelled From Paradise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13391/Rakuen_Tsuihou:_Expelled_from_Paradise), then I'll take the slash and burns without complaining.

Long series can be a big risk. They could end up being bound by contract to make hundreds of series for a show that'll never sell any blurays. Making a single cour anime is great for prodding interest. Toei seem to be the only ones willing to do it consistently.

Anime is also usually for marketing the source material, which means you don't need a full adaption.
>> ARTICLE
> Long series can be a big risk. They could end up being bound by contract to make hundreds of series for a show that'll never sell any blurays.

At that point break the contract may be more 'profitable' for the company.

Unless the cost of being sued for breaking a contract exceeds the cost of make 100+ anime episodes that will have shit sales.

>> ARTICLE
I see..so you mean to say that Toei Animation produces anime not with intention to market original material ??

Is it a anime only oriented studio ???

Then P.A and Madhouse are different??
>> ARTICLE
Ah, no, that's not what I mean, necessarily. If you're marketing something, you don't need a full adaption, but only a few cours, maybe even one, to create interest in the original source material.

But since Toei has a fuckton of money from their big titles, they can basically not care about any of that.
>> ARTICLE
I see regarding that explanation:

I am assuming u are watching Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry and Gakusen Toshi no Asterix

Gakusen and Rakudai are both kind of similiar anime in various aspects..But Gakusen is getting a second cours as well while Rakudai is not getting any at least for now...Gakusen is from Aniplex and Rakudai is from Sentai..Who Rich producers(Aniplex) create longer series without caring for the fact that anime is just to market original source material ??
>> ARTICLE
If they believe it's a good decision, money wise, then there's no reason for them to not make more.

It's not that they don't care about marketing the source, it's just that it's not as prevalent in their mind.

The anime market is slowing. Manglobe recently filed for bankruptcy, and as you can see, short, single cour are more popular, since they're safer.
>> ARTICLE
Okai..Thnx for clearing my doubts

Indeed I was sad when Manglobe filed for bankruptcy...I re-watched Hayate no Gotoku to pay my respects :-D

So we might soon have to turn to original source after seeing any anime.Sad there aren't any Shakugan no Shana's recently 
A perfect anime adaptation
>> ARTICLE
Having to turn to the source materialbis quite common for me. Bersker, S&W, Manglobes own The World God Only Knows. All series I want more of, but there is and there will be no more anime :(
>> ARTICLE
Agreed two year ago...I had to read only Usagi Drop and Sankarea..now I have more than 70-80 manga and LN in my Plan to Read List ..A prime example is this..anime ends before showing anything but that Light Novels are damn awesome [Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou desu yo?](http://myanimelist.net/manga/45855/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_desu_yo)

Toei rich af bruh. 
>> ARTICLE
Pls read the next question..then why do P.A Works and Madhouse not produce bigger adaptations ??

They are rich as well :-D
>> ARTICLE
Let me introduce you to a current ongoing show called **Ace of Diamond**

And Madhouse is in heavy debt atm
>> ARTICLE
They're not near as rich though. Late night anime studios like them. 
>> ARTICLE
What abt Anipex m8??
>> ARTICLE
That's publisher, like Sentai
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse does have some longer adaptations. HxH, Cardcaptor Sakura, Monster etc. Toei just has more staff so they can handle long adaptations and still do other projects.
>> ARTICLE
I see..Thnx for clearing my doubts :-D

Don't u think Toei has been on decline in recent years??

I have not seen any good anime for them in 2015 
>> ARTICLE
Watch Go Princess Precure then.
>> ARTICLE
I am not into Idol shows sorry but I will try to watch it :-D

Basically what I was trying to say here was after Lovely Complex quality anime from Toei has disappeared..Where all amazing series like Dragon Ball , One Piece are from 1990's
>> ARTICLE
It's a Mahou Shoujo actually

>after Lovely Complex quality anime from Toei has disappeared

That's not true though they did Kyousogiga and all those other Precure series. Besides Toei hasn't really been a quality studio since like Pre-90's

Okay I am sorry for the faux pax :-P


So u mean to say 60's and 70's were better?

More like 70s to late 80s is where the bulk of what built them up as a studio originated. Stuff like Mazinger, Getter Robo, Cutey Honey, Captain Harlock. Then of course you've got the Dragonball and Dragonball Z's that bled into the 90s as well as Sailor Moon. But most of what has come after those hasn't exactly been particularly noteworthy outside from a small handful.

Okai Thnx for the help m8

I appreciate them making them, love the longer ones as long as they are decent.

Also Madhouse got at least one long one which is pretty highly rated, namely Hunter x Hunter.

The reason a lot of longer manga get short anime is to promote the manga, and is like the curse of anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's a curse

Anime ends before showing anything...A prime example is [Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo)

School Days is often mentioned in a trolling sense because it has high shock factor if you weren't prepared for it, but it's not considered a bad story. A lot of people hate it though, the MC is quite possibly *the* most widely-reviled protagonist in anime.

Kiss x Sis is one that you'd suggest to someone with a nudge and a wink since it's ecchi sister incest that borders on hentai, but people who go for that sort of thing consider it a good show.

Baccano, Code Geass, Steins;Gate, K-ON, Clannad, Ano Hana and Evangelion are loved unironically by many.

The ones I haven't mentioned are considered decent by most people.

So the list isn't a troll.
>> ARTICLE
I figured most of them weren't trolls, but the incessant giggling did make me worry about a few. Thanks for the warnings!
>> ARTICLE
I keep hearing things like that about School Days (I haven't watched it am afraid to) but what's strange about it?
>> ARTICLE
**Ga Rei Zero** - Watch it. It's fucking good. Just watch the first episode, as they do the whole [In Medias Res](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_medias_res) thing where they just throw you in and you have no clue what is going on. If the first episode doesn't completely pull you in, or even spark a little bit of interest, I don't know what to say. I like to call it the spiritual successor to Berserk.

**Baka To Test** - Really well done romantic comedy. If you're looking for some light hearted fun, this is worth a watch.

**Slam Dunk** - One of the best sports shounen series that I've seen. It's pretty old (1993), but it still ages very well. If you plan to watch this, don't plan on an ending. Something happened with the studio and they literally just stopped animating it. If you want an ending, you'll have to read the manga, and even then, it's also cut short because of the problems they were having
>> ARTICLE
I started with Ga Rei Zero because that was the one most vehemently suggested by my friend. I love it so far, and I'm only on episode 2. That first episode ending was crazy. [](/s "SLICE")
>> ARTICLE
I have not seen all of them, but from my experience: Code Geass, Stens;Gate, Baccano, and Clannad are all very high quality. I have heard terrible things about KissxKiss and Baka Test. I have seen School Days and it is really, really weird but not necessarily bad.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you very much!
>> ARTICLE
>I have heard terrible things about KissxKiss and Baka Test

Opposite for me, I've basically only heard good things about them, and personally they're my favourite ecchi/comedy shows.
>> ARTICLE
All of those shows except for School Days have a decent score on MAL, and from what I've seen they all seem popular and liked.

If this helps at all, I've seen Baccano, Code Geass, Steins;Gate, Clannad, K-On, Ano Hana, Another and Evangelion. I thought K-On was kinda average, and Another was pretty good. I loved all the others. 
I tried Baka and Test but couldn't really get into it.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I'll wait to start on School Days. Many thanks!
>> ARTICLE
None of those are nad really. School days may be a bit out of your comfort zone if you're new. Same with evangelion.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I thought instead off looking them all up and trying them one by one, I'd ask people who've, collectively seen all of them. 
>> ARTICLE
As best I can tell none of these are jokes. They're mostly shonen. Granted KissxKiss is ecchi, bordering on hentai. Obviously I don't know if you are a boy or a girl. But, in general I'm pretty sure they're good titles, although a few of them I haven't seen myself, I'll list the ones I have.

Steins;Gate - It's really good, starts slow (or at least for me it did) but is worth the wait.

Another - Also a fairly good anime.

Ano Hana - Full name is Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Boku-tachi wa Mada Shiranai. I don't know why I have so much fun saying that aloud. It's really good one of my personal favorites.

Code Geass - I really liked this when I was a big shonen fan. Now I watch mostly seinen, still good though.

Eva - Assuming this is a reference to Evangelion. I have somewhat mixed feelings about it, but I still think it's worth the watch for everyone.

KissxKiss - Uhm, yeah I don't admit I saw this anime, it's an interesting recommendation compared to the others.
>> ARTICLE
I tried Stiens:Gate a few weeks ago. It was so slow that it turned me off. If you say that it was worth it, I'll go try it again. 

Yeah...I think KissxKiss was the 'joke' one, but I wanted to be sure.

On Eva, one of them just blurted it out as we were leaving the class. "EE-VEE-AY Write it down!" I never got the full title.
>> ARTICLE
Watch steins;gate until episode 12. From that point on is when you realize you're in for a ride. The effects of messing with time finally catch up to them and the series gets serious along with several unexpected twists.

Neon genesis evangelion is the full title you're looking for. S;G and Eva are my favorites of all time. Code Geass is also up there.

 The other titles you mentioned are all very good suggestions except for one.

I really didn't enjoy school days and would avoid it. It is usually a troll suggestion. The series has some of the stupidest and widely hated characters(makoto) and the story isn't that great either but it has one of the most shocking endings ever that left me speechless and I found myself slow clapping when it was all over. It was a twisted yet satisfying ending but was it worth watching all those episodes? No.
>> ARTICLE
Will do, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Schooldays
KissxKiss

Tears to my eyes...

Try Boku no Pico - really good. You might even prefer it to Code Geass...

Also - /r/animesuggest

Hope you enjoy
>> ARTICLE
I'll add Boku no Pico to my list then too!
Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks for the link to the other sub. Didn't even know it existed!
>> ARTICLE
boku no pico is *the* troll reccomendation on this subreddit. :) sorry for ruining everyones fun but this guy seemed too innocent and nice.
>> ARTICLE
I hadn't looked it up yet...
Thanks for that...
I haven't been watching anime for long. I just got back into it since I stopped early in middle school. 
>> ARTICLE
Right. Since I got trollblocked, I'll switch to actually helpful mode:

Don't watch Bakemonogatari until you've seen at least a dozen other series.

You may end up loving it as your favourite series of all time, but you need to be adapted to anime and all its quirks first, else you ruin the experience for yourself.

Same applies to Angel Beats! and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

Black Lagoon can be picked up and watched by any old chump, but it gets pretty heavy into dark themes and psychology.

Any case, happy watching!
>> ARTICLE
I'm at episode 11 of Bakemonogatari...

Damn. Am I really missing that much that I will ruin it by having watched most of it already? I really am loving it right now. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, shit. Nevermind.

I suppose just rewatch it once you consider yourself a seasoned anime fan.

You will love it even more the second watch, partly for the fact that it is a pedigreed anime (most Studio Shaft stuff is), and partly for the fact that it is such a brilliant, subtle piece of fiction.

EDIT: For the record - I've seen it four times over.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I hope its even better the second time then!
>> ARTICLE
Warning, KissXSis is really ecchi. Really good and great fap material, though.

Clannad and Clannad After Story.
Most amazing form of media I have ever seen, anime or not. (I've seen a lot of anime)
Clannad starts off slow and you will surely doubt if it will go anywhere, but it is necessary to get to the true masterpiece(After Story).
I have forced many people to get through Clannad to get to After Story and all have dropped to their knees and thanked me. I can't recommend anything more than that.

There is NOTHING more emotional than Clannad. Hardly anyone who has seen it and Clannad: After Story would disagree.
The feels it gave me are more than I thought were possible with a human mind. It changed my entire outlook on life and I can't recommend it enough. It's insane.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica isn't an adaptation of anything. It is anime original and has a 12 episode series (with a fairly conclusive ending), 2 movies which recap the series and a third movie which is a sequel, but it's kinda open ended, as in, it's a story in itself, but leaves room for another sequel.

If you *really* don't want a sequel-setup ending, you can watch only the 12 episode series and be fine with it.

also, quick suggestion, why not start up a [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net/panel.php) account to keep track of all the shows you've watched? I feel like it'd make things like this a lot easier.
>> ARTICLE
watched most of it.
I see Yuri Kuma Arashi is still ongoing as a manga, which predates the anime.
Other than that, ill try Penguindrum and Aoi Bungaku which i haven't seen before, ty.

Also about the list, I have too many that I can't even remember I saw, also many that I dropped after a few episodes. I already tried making a list in anime-planet, but its way too troublesome.
>> ARTICLE
Yuri Kuma's manga was written by the director of the show as a promotion for the series, not vice versa, so it follows a different plot, much like the Cowboy Bebop shojo manga and Evangelion shonen manga. the series is a complete package. hope you enjoy Aoi Bungaku and Penguindrum!!
>> ARTICLE
I guess the dates in the wiki page are misleading, I'll try Yuri Kuma Arashi  also. Ty.
>> ARTICLE
You might find [this](http://imgur.com/a/yyrny) useful.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you, but I see that I already watched like 90% of that, also a lot of these are still on-going, like berserk and spice & wolf.
I will use it though, maybe I can fish out some gems, ty.
>> ARTICLE
I believe Spice and Wolf's LNs have wrapped up and would encourage you to give it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
LNs aren't my thing sadly.
Gotta wait for a new anime season or for the manga to finish and hope  the manga adaptation is close to the source.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about a manga adaptation but there won't be any further seasons of Spice and Wolf. As much as I want to believe, that dream is dead. The existing two seasons are all we're ever going to have. That said, what we have doesn't leave you in too bad of a spot.

Sad. =(
Guess I'll wait for the manga then.

there is a remake planned so hopefully you'll give it a shot once its out.

Goody!

Kill la Kill and gurren laggan are originals Im pretty sure

Watched season one till the end, and when the cuteness wore off, I saw there was nothing else.
Not a big fan of shows with no real story.
Thanks for the suggestion though!
>> ARTICLE
* Suisei No Gargantia

* Almost every Gundam series (though some may have incomplete/untranslated spin offs)

* Katanagatari

* Darker than Black

* Barakamon

* Psychopass 

* Fate (One of the routes will probably not be animated and another hasn't started yet but the source material is complete and UBW is complete) 
>> ARTICLE
Almost everything here I have already seen or on my download list.
Also Barakamon and Suisei No Gargantia are listed as on-going (manga) in the wiki (I've been waiting for both to finish).
Also, by fate you mean fate stay night and fate zero?
>> ARTICLE
Gargantia and barakamon are both anime originals so the Manga is actually just an adaption of the anime. By Fate I mean the whole series. You can watch ubw now as it's a standalone anime while heavens feel (not out yet) is a different route /alternative story. Fate/zero is a prequel. Both are complete in the source material. 
>> ARTICLE
Ty, I'll watch them both.
>> ARTICLE
Like "Yurikuma Arashi" Gargantia is an original anime, therefore completed, and the manga is only advertisement.

In general, if an anime is based on a manga, you can assume the manga must have started more than one year (usually it's more) before the anime due to necessity that there need to be enough chapters to animate and because it takes at least half a year to get from the anime kickoff meetings to completed episodes (even if not all are completed when broadcasting starts).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the info! I'll download those then.
>> ARTICLE
Inuyasha? It seemed like it would go unfinished for a while after dragging on to 167 episodes with some being irrelevant to the overarching plot lines (basically a sort of filler), but then five years later they went and did a great final 26-episode season that was all relevant episodes and wrapped it all up nicely.

Midori Days should also be right up *everyone's* alley.

I see My Hime on there, but where's My Otome?
>> ARTICLE
I've seen Inuyasha, and both midori days and mai otome is in my download list.
Thanks for the suggestion tho!
>> ARTICLE
Initial D, if you like car racing in some way, though 5th and 6th seasons may not have the same pop. It is adapted fully from the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Tried to see it, finished the first season, but its just not for me. Maybe its the super dated CGI, but I think its mostly the downhill racing thing isn't exiting for me.
Thanks for the suggestion though!
>> ARTICLE
The animation does get better in future seasons, but I respect your opinion.

Aw...Big O! And Escaflowne. Not that I didn't see that coming, but I'm still sad.

And today...

* It's a shame Now and Then just got booted so fast. It's a damn good show.  
* The original Gundam vs Elfen Lied? Hmm. Who wins? Newness, or  monster fanbase?  
* Speaking of fanbases...GT vs Utena. Now, GT is almost universally hated, but it's still Dragonball. Which makes me wonder who will win this one.  
* Oh gods..Macross vs Dragon Ball (original). This is gonna be a bloodbath.   
* Well it was nice to see Wolf's Rain win, briefly...

Kino is going to lose to Cowboy Bebop next round. I hope it'll at least be close...

As for this round, I voted...

**Evangelion** > Now and Then, Here and There . Now and Then was pretty good, but Evangelion is one of the best. Its seeded #2 for a reason, you know?

Sailor Moon < **Last Exile** . I feel like I would have enjoyed Sailor Moon a lot more if I had watched it when I first started watching anime. Last Exile, on the other hand...its been a long time since I've actually watched it (rewatch potential?) but it was enjoyable.

**LoGH** > Cromatie . I'm currently watching Cromartie and...I'm not really impressed. I'm hoping it picks up a bit, but its nowhere near as good as LoGH

I really need to finish Monster and start Texhnolyze...
>> ARTICLE
I agree about Last Exile, even today it is still a gorgeous anime with amazing character design work and a fun story with solid characterisation (even if the ending was a little flat.

If you didn't like Cro High from the start you probably wont ever like it, if you enjoy its particular brand of ridiculous humor it is great but if you don't it is never going to stick.
>> ARTICLE
oh wow I can vote on two of these, this is great!

LotGH > Cromartie High School, easily  
Bo-bobo > Yugioh

The links are for me to keep track of some random things I feel like I could easily mix up. Also, some of the ranks seem to have changed slightly, so OP's list and mine won't match up on some places.

Censorship probably have no effect, sample size definitely had an effect.

I think I'll leave it there. Still, it's an interesting bit of data-crunching...
>> ARTICLE
IRRC the Anikore rank is based on popularity and not score, so I'm not sure how much it'll be directly comparable.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it will at least be including the total score number. And those at least seem to be following the rank number so far...
>> ARTICLE
The Bangumi rank is also slightly based on popularity.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam War in the Pocket:

> bangumi.tv: Rank 44

> MAL: Rank 764.

China > West. 

Also the fact that all the GitS being rated so much higher says quality tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I can get behind this list a little more (one piece is higher :D) 
>> ARTICLE
> 86 WALL-E

wat
>> ARTICLE
It's an animated movie, and a damn good one at that
>> ARTICLE
Yet again, Gintama within the top 3.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is fucking huge in China (pun intended)
>> ARTICLE
Im actually surprised Hikaru no Go is there, no one talks about it
>> ARTICLE
This is the first ranking Ive seen which puts Steins;Gate and FMAB that low. 
>> ARTICLE
This list isn't filled with hyped up shows like MAL is, interesting.

EDIT: I noticed the smaller number of people who rated these anime, which may attribute to the difference between it and MAL
>> ARTICLE
Yes, OPM isn't in this freaking list

[](#helmetbro)
>> ARTICLE
\#1 is Cowboy Bebop, I'm impressed
>> ARTICLE
They seem to like Mecha and Sci-Fi/Space more. Interesting.
>> ARTICLE
What's kind of interesting is that compared against MAL, you'd need to skew these scores up by 0.15 to 0.25.  I'm curious about their overall average score, and the number of anime on their list.

Some changes are nice, like not having FMA:B as an absurd 9.25.  But then again, Gintama is still up there, so wamp wamp.

Fumoffu at75, everything is right with this list

One of the best sports anime I've ever watched/read
>> ARTICLE
You have very good taste sir.
>> ARTICLE
[Haikyuu!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu) 2nd season has been some of the best anime I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a huge Kuroko fanboy, I will never not be, it may not be the "manliest" or have the most "realistic characters", but I do not give a single fuck. No other anime has given me that feeling of absolute adrenaline and motivation like KnB has and it will always remain my favorite anime of all time, period.

Sometimes I don't need a deep story or sidelining plot twists, I just want to see Green Haired Japanese Steph Curry shoot a 3 pointer from the other basket, or see an emo looking engrish speaking mothafucka with a chain use double team or blue haired Kobe Bryant with the behind the basket clutch with the Blue Eyes White Dragon lightning coming out his eyes.

GOT DAYUM!!!

1. [Ashita no Joe](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2402/Ashita_no_Joe) The story shows me the importance of life.

2. [Major](http://myanimelist.net/anime/627/Major_S1) It made me know how to play baseball.

3. [Eyeshield 21](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15/Eyeshield_21) It made me realize that American football is very complicated.

4. [Yu-Gi-Oh](http://www.kingrpg.net/2015/07/ordinary-yu-gi-oh-cards-to-ultimate-3d.html) LOL, I think it's a type of sport like Chess. I like its fantasy.
>> ARTICLE
Ookiku Furikabutte. Everything else pales in comparison for me. 

If you're willing to stretch your definition of "sports" a little, Chihayafuru is extremely good too, though very different from the average male-centered sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
Love the show, hate the mc
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game >>>>>>>>>>>>>> then Chihayafuru. Not taking anything away from Chihayafuru, because I loved the shit out of it, it just shows how good I think Cross Game is. It is imo the best and closest to perfect anime I have seen.

Man, these are coming up more often.

[Wanna Be the Strongest in the World!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11763/Sekai_de_Ichiban_Tsuyoku_Naritai!), it started out rough but in the end I loved it. It had an MC that I wanted to cheer of & reminded my why I use to love watching pro-wrestling. I have watched the show about 4 times now (twice in sub, twice in dub).

Cross game. It does not focus on the sport, but it still delivers very well in terms of characters and story. 

Other choices would include Kuroko because of the hype, and Ping Pong because of the directing and characters. Pending on my list are Haikyuu!, Diamond no Ace, and Hajime no Ippo so I can't really judge them yet.

Morbito was on Netflix. May depend on region. One of the best fantasy anime there is.
>> ARTICLE
It's still there in the US.  And on Hulu as well.  Both sites have the dubbed and subbed versions.
>> ARTICLE
Netflix -

Psycho Pass/Psycho Pass 2

Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works

Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood

Hunter x Hunter



>> ARTICLE
Doesn't Netflix also have *Fate/Zero*? Unless OP plans on reading the *F/SN* VN, they should probably watch *F/Z* before *F/SN UBW*.

edit: Also, Netflix is missing the last season of *FMA:B*, so you'll need to watch the ending elsewhere, OP. It's on Funimation's site. Though that site appears to be down at the moment, frustratingly enough.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero is on there too. I was just suggesting the *better* one. Chronologically, start there though.
>> ARTICLE
Its ok, everyone is wrong sometimes

>> ARTICLE
I respectfully disagree about which is the better anime.
>> ARTICLE
I understand that, it's just personal preference. 

Fate/Zero is well worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
I know a lot of the Major streaming platforms have HunterXHunter. And I know it is on Netflix. Pretty great show.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't Netflix missing the last 48 episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Ye but you can always just go to Crunchy Roll to finish it.
>> ARTICLE
Netflix:

- Silver Spoon (missing S2)

- Madoka Magica

- Aldnoah.Zero (this one in particular seems fitting to your tastes).

For Hulu, there's more than I can count, as Hulu has a massive amount of anime. Just to name a few,

- Trigun

- Cowboy Bebop

- Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun
>> ARTICLE
Netflix has *Silver Spoon* S2, it just lumps all the episodes together as a single season.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, it does? I've seen the show already so I when I saw just the main one on Netflix I assumed it meant just S1.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I just watched the first season for a contract last week.
>> ARTICLE
Sports anime don't sell dvds. Most attempts to sell sports anime here in the western world have resulted in financial losses, so they are very rarely even licensed anymore, let alone had money spent dubbing them.

Free is the only recent series I've seen a company willing to take a chance on, and that series has the fact it can be marketed as a 'fanservice' series instead of just a club/sport show going for it.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, makes sense. Still, I would think Kuroko would get picked up. Seems to be a pretty popular show.
>> ARTICLE
Slam Dunk does have an English dub.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, really? Is it a full dub?
>> ARTICLE
It probably was, but isn't being sold anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Just checked, and I think they dubbed like 70 some episodes, but not the full thing.
>> ARTICLE
Oh. I guess it wasn't popular in the US.
>> ARTICLE
It depends on who licenses it, I believe. For example, the second season of Free! was licensed and is going to be dubbed by Funimation. The first season was not licensed by them and will likely not be receiving a dub any time soon unless they get their hands on it. Ping Pong the Animation was also licensed by Funi, and it's getting a dub soon.
>> ARTICLE
They're not as popular as other anime genres in the West, generally speaking.  Popularity matters when it comes to a licensing company picking up a series and then deciding whether to release it subbed / dubbed, or not at all.
>> ARTICLE
prince of tennis? i do not know for sure...
>> ARTICLE
True, Prince of Tennis doesn't have a complete dub. It appears it had 50 episodes dubbed, but no more.
>> ARTICLE
Cuz 'Murica loves pew pew prw not talky talky. Setiously though the west mainly likes action, and sports anime just doesnt cut it. Not to mention people follow real sports here like it's a cult, so good luck trying to get them to watch fake sports with hugh school frarma mixed in.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say its more of the fact that the typical nerd in the west is not into sports as much as the people who watch anime in Japan (a grouping that is larger than just otaku).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I have read about that but you have to notice that so many movies with great messages fail. Not to mention a lot of these movies have action/drama, but fail if they are just a little sensitve. Idk maybe it's just me.
>> ARTICLE
Because they aren't actually popular.
>> ARTICLE
I would say that its only a rumor.
>> ARTICLE
Dam...  I just hate watching incomplete anime....  
>> ARTICLE
I just dont think this would be any good, as much as i love slam dunk, the manga didnt really end that well.
>> ARTICLE
Too bad sports anime/manga die a horrible death when brought over to the us. Incidentally though, niconico just finished up a live stream marathon of slam dunk last week. Often times the marathons mean some kind of promotion so maybe there will be an announcement soon? 
>> ARTICLE
The show is also getting some tribute 
http://sneakernews.com/2014/08/17/anime-inspired-air-jordan-6-slam-dunk/

The already 5 month old article says it's a rumor so don't expect anything.

Loving the praise for Akagami, Heavy Object, ~~KonoSuba~~ and uhh IBO! All 3 have been pretty good this season, HO especially has gotten so much better!

As for Megumin's VA she also had [a great role on Shirobako](http://imgur.com/a/L0UKT)!

Glad to see some sports love. They're exciting and the journey you go on with those characters is just amazing :)

One day I'll get to Free...
>> ARTICLE
>she also had a great role on Shirobako  
  
HAHA I had no idea that was the same person! Wow, I vaguely remember her... that's a lot of dedication to a small (but integral!) member of Shirobako!   
  
Free! is pretty great! I wish it had more of a story to it, but I mean the visuals are spectacular. I heard it gets better developed in Eternal Summer, so that and Chu2Koi Ren are on my PTW list...
>> ARTICLE
Yo, you didn't even hit me up.

I'd have been perfect for that segment, lol.

Also you linked to the wrong episode mai boi.

I'm sorry man!! We could've talked so much Kuroko Extra Game news, too. 
  
And yo thanks for the heads up that was a dumb mistake LOL

No problem man, but I'm glad this topic is being discussed.

You already know that I'm hyped for Extra Game, but I definitely did not expect the compilation films, I hope they reanimate some of those matches.

I am watching Prince of Stride [for this delicious trap](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/98/62/4c/98624cf14e89ae8971ccdaf54ce28025.jpg), the parkour is just a bonus.
