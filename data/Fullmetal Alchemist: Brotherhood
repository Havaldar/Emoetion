How can you guys only watch one episode a day? I cant do that!
>> ARTICLE
I imagine it's pretty easy at first. Once it hits about episode 20 it starts running on all cylinders and never really stops. 
>> ARTICLE
You tell yourself it is bad and then it works.

I'm a first time watcher, I have confidence in my willpower. In fact, tag me, and I'll try to prove it.

It's quite simple. Watch one episode, then lock yourself in a room without a PC or tv in it for 24 hours. Then repeat.
>> ARTICLE
That might actually work! Thanks for the advice.
>> ARTICLE
I wish I could watch even one... new semester starts up in just over a week and it'll vaporize all this glorious anime time I'm currently basking in. :(
>> ARTICLE
You won't have even 20 minutes a day to yourself?
>> ARTICLE
Well I will, but I have other free time activities that are more pressing than watching anime (reading, cooking, piano, SLEEP), so I usually only end up watching 3-4 episodes per week, so I can barely keep up with what's airing.
>> ARTICLE
Magic. Though it is really hard since every episode feels like it is 2 min long. I am thinking about increasing the episode count by 1 every 15 episodes. That way as the show gets better we will watch more. And it will come to a point where the last 60-64 episodes are in one day. 

**EDIT:
Due to the difficulty of watching one episode a day from this amazing anime, we will be increasing the episode count of the discussions by 1 every 15 episodes. So after we pass episode 15,30,45 and 60 we will be increasing the episode count by 1. That way by episode 60 the last 4 episodes will be in one day.**
>> ARTICLE
And so begins the adventure of the Elric brothers. I am getting so much nostalgia from this even if I watched it like 2 months ago. This is my third rewatch. Hearing the opening hits me hard.

I have a lot of OP's that I really like, but Again is definitely my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
The feels I got when the opening started <3
>> ARTICLE
Oh hey this is pretty good timing, didn't know there was a rewatch planned and my friends have been bugging me to watch this.
>> ARTICLE
Bear in mind that even fans of the show tend to dislike the first episode as it's kind of irrelevant to the story. I think it was mostly created because they wanted to assure viewers that it wouldn't just be a rehash of the 2003 series, but it comes across as pretty generic.
>> ARTICLE
It is kinda generic, and has a lot more humor than the rest of the series. Perhaps necessarily. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked it. Its a good trailer for the show!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the warning, but I'm not too worried about it. I'm sure I'll enjoy the show, I've seen a bunch of episodes scattered over time and the friends who really want me to watch it know some of my tastes well enough.
>> ARTICLE
Looking back, I liked the first episode because of [how](/s "chillingly it echoed the rest of the story")
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the first episode that got me into anime. Good times, guys. Good times.
>> ARTICLE
Woah, seriously!? I've been putting this one off for so long, but since apparently its getting removed from netflix soon, I thought I would start watching it. In fact, I was literally just thinking to myself "alright, I think I'm just about done surfing /r/anime, time to start watching."

And then BAM, here you are. Awesome!
>> ARTICLE
Goddamnit. Don't even get me started about Netflix. I tried to watch Brotherhood as soon as I finished the original like 3 years ago and I got stuck on the episode where Al goes into the snow. I just finished it for the first time a few weeks ago. I got all the way to episode 52 and it just ended. I thought thats how many episodes there were. Turns out there are 64. It is still missing that many episodes after 3 years! I ended up having to get the last 12 episodes by less than legal means. I would have paid for them but there was no way I was going to wait a week for a DVD when the tension in the last 20 or so episodes is at an all time high. *TLDR: Netflix can't update shit.*
>> ARTICLE
Netflix is missing the last season and has been for years, unfortunately and inexplicably.

P.S. hi Blitz!
>> ARTICLE
Netflix UK has all 5 seasons, though.
>> ARTICLE
Oh what? That's ridiculous, why don't we have it then?
>> ARTICLE
Hello Omega! 

Yeah, I know about that. I heard it was because of copyright reasons or something like that. I'll just have to go somewhere else for that part.
>> ARTICLE
Like 8 times aren't enough... I'll join you guys on my 9th time rewatching it!
>> ARTICLE
~~No one told me we were doing this! Brb editing in 24 minutes~~

It's been a long time since I rewatched the series so hearing the OP made me really nostalgic. 

[Very vague future episode spoilers](/s "This was basically "SPOILERS: The Episode" ") 

I'm watching the subbed version because I watched the dub first, and TBH I kinda prefer the dubbed voices but I'll keep watching this.

[Very **MAJOR SPOILERS**, first time viewers please don't look](/s "Seeing a certain character just breaks my heart") 

Edit#2: I thought I'd share some useful information. 

* **To first time viewers:** The studio gambled on enough people having seen the original FMA, which is why the beginning of FMA:B is kinda rushed. It isn't bad at all, but episode 14-15 is when it starts getting really, *really* good. So don't give up on it! Also, both the dubbed version and the subbed versions are well-done, so just pick one. 

* **To the manga readers:** Yes, this episode was filler. Next episode is canon, however FMA:B rushes through the first 30-ish chapters because of the stuff I mentioned above. After that, it is an almost entirely faithful adaptation. 

* **To the people who watched the original FMA:** Rejoice, you have seen the stuff that FMA:B rushed through, but you have also seen a lot of filler shit that was neither in the manga nor in FMA:B. Episode 8-9 is when FMA:B's story *starts* separating from the original FMA's story. However, I would recommend **not** skipping to episode 8 to avoid getting confused. 

I hope I didn't get anything wrong \^^
>> ARTICLE
There is a thread on the front page that in 4 hours I would make a thread about episode 1.
>> ARTICLE
I just woke up and went straight to /new/
>> ARTICLE
Have fun.

['Bout that spoiler] (/s "I fuckin KNOW. Every time I see him, I just think... Poor Hughes. I never suspected it the first time around (I watched FMA first, no manga), and I realized after how obvious it was... he was too good, too uninvolved, and too much a family man. ;__;")


>> ARTICLE
It's probably one of my favorite manga but I never watched the anime. Is it a faithful adaptation ? I'm watching ep1 right now anyway.
>> ARTICLE
The beginning is modified, but it is the same after 9 episodes. If not better. :P

Unless I'm mistaken, FMA:B rushed through the first 30~ chapters because the studio believed enough people had seen the original FMA, after that it is a faithful adaptation.

sorry about that
>> ARTICLE
One of the first anime I watched and it also has one of the best OPs too.

For first time watching people, prepare yourselves, there is a good reason why this anime is #1 on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
How do you rank all of FMAB's OP's?

I'd have to say 1>5>4>2>3
>> ARTICLE
1>3>5>2>4
>> ARTICLE
1=3>2>4=5
>> ARTICLE
3>4>5>1>2


>> ARTICLE
Excuse me, did you just fucking call OP3 the worst?
>> ARTICLE
They're all so good, they're practically all equal in quality. It's my least favorite but it still gives me chills/goosebumps. Happy now? ;)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's fine. To be honest, I was going to rank them until I realized that I was going to have to put something in last.
>> ARTICLE
I like this first chapter a lot more than the original anime first one, it presents more characters and it does that well. It actually gives more hype than the original one, that's for sure.

Bradley looks like a badass.
>> ARTICLE
Because Bradley is a badass.
>> ARTICLE
I actually never really liked this episode, always felt a bit too "fillerish" for me. I believe episode 2 is where the series really begins.
>> ARTICLE
I just like that they put a good amount of important characters already. I'm a first time watcher anyway, tomorrow I'll see if you're right.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I always found it to be weird as well.  You meet all of these characters, who immediately disappear for a long time.  And you find yourself some indeterminate time in the past, too.  You're then slowly re-introduced as if you had never met them.  While I agree it's kind of nice to see the personalities and action of the series up-front, I think it takes away more than it adds.  

Bradley being badass should be a surprise.  Armstrong's ridiculousness should catch you off-guard.  Mustang's aversion to water happens at a crucial plot moment.  But because of this episode, so many people miss out on those little things.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time watching and I've waited to start this anime for a long time, so this rewatch is a good opportunity to do it!
>> ARTICLE
I want to be in your position again. The anime is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Ooo this will be a good chance for me to catch up on the series. 
>> ARTICLE
I was never a huge fan of episode one but the series is amazing i shall join you guys on this adventure. hype!
>> ARTICLE
This first episode, though I have to admit isn't the best first episode I've ever seen pretty much gives you the basic rundown of what to expect in this anime. It has comedy (edward being short), action (don't need to explain this lol), and a real brutal glimpse of the dark undertone that the show can possibly have (taboos of alchemy, human transmutation).

Right from the get-go you can see whether you'll like this anime or not and it *can* cater to all audiences. Looking back really makes you appreciate the masterpiece of FMA:B.
>> ARTICLE
The first episode isn't really good, I agree. It reminds me of the first Gintama episode that did the same thing: Have a random filler story that wasn't in the source material and use it to introduce the world and all the characters and to give people a quick overview of the show (the first episode of Gintama however does a horrible job and is usually considered to be one of the weakest episodes of the entire show), then in the next episode go back to the very start of the main story.
>> ARTICLE
Having rewatched FMAB once I still can't believe it is over. It was one of the most interesting an well written things I've watched/seen. Looking back it feels like a dream that this anime exists. 2 months have passed since the last time I've seen it, yet I can't forget how glorious it is.
>> ARTICLE
I re-watch it about once or twice a year, depending on how bad the current season of anime is. Don't think I will ever grow tired of it. As much as I want more, [the ending](/s "was so extremely satisfying that I don't mind there not being more content. Seriously, giving up alchemy after being dependent on it for almost all his life is a really good finisher.")

Studio Bones really produced an extremely high piece of work, it's really depressing that there hasn't been another show from them like FMA:B.
>> ARTICLE
Guys, I will be starting my first time watch and this episode in exactly 15 minutes. You have the privilege to clear up this question for me:

Dub or Sub?

Remember, I am starting to watch the possibly best anime series ever created. Don't let me down. I shall wait for your answers.
>> ARTICLE
Sub. Personally I always prefer sub over dub.
>> ARTICLE
FMA is among the best dubs out there.  Since most shows benefit greatly from subs (for translational quirks or because the dub sucks), take advantage of the fact that you have a fantastic dub that doesn't take away from the show.
>> ARTICLE
Dubbed. The series starts to be amazing around 15 episodes. Don't be let down by the comedy the first episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Depends on what you prefer, i personally found the sub to be far better.
>> ARTICLE
Aww, I'm too late. But my vote goes for sub - Paku Romi is awesome as Edward!
>> ARTICLE
The Dub is one of the best out there. Also you can never go wrong with Troy Baker.
>> ARTICLE
the dub for this is amazing, but i feel like the sub is even better, and i'd wait to watch the dub in a future rewatch or something like that
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I will watch the dub for the first 10-20 eps and then rethink my choice. Thanks for your hard work onii-chans!
>> ARTICLE
I watched the dub in its entirety and just watched the subbed version of the first episode. 

Both are well-done - just pick one
>> ARTICLE
Having watched the show only once, dubbed, and now re watching it subbed, I have to say I so far prefer the dub (oddly enough as I'd call myself a dub denier :P).

I'll give it more time, but if it doesn't grow on me, I'll switch back to the dub.
>> ARTICLE
This should be good. I have been trying to find time to watch this so might as well join in. I saw FMA when it was on toonami a long time ago, I understand the story to brotherhood is different. 
>> ARTICLE
BUCKLE THE FUCK UP.
>> ARTICLE
I'm confused as to why we should spoiler tag in a re-watch thread.Doesnt that contradict itself?You have watched it already, why spoiler tag anything.
>> ARTICLE
There are people watching for the first time. That is why.
>> ARTICLE
Ah so it is not for re-watching and discussing small stuff you might have missed the first time.My bad then, misunderstood the concept.
>> ARTICLE
You are free to discuss that kind of stuff, just use spoiler tags appropriately. Nobody's going to get annoyed (or at least they shouldn't) about sections of the page covered in black bars, given the nature of the thread.
>> ARTICLE
In all fairness, that's not a bad thing to discuss, just so long as it's contained to what we've already seen. I'm a first time watcher and I'd love to see people who are rewatching discuss little things they missed, just so long as it doesn't spoil me on anything in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Damn thats weird, I actually started rewatching the anime like a couple of days ago :P what a perfect timing
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching FMA:B less than a week ago, I guess this is a good excuse to watch it all again.
>> ARTICLE
This is a great series that I am so nostalgic for. This was like my fifth anime I watched while attempting to delve into the eco-system that is anime.
 BTW i watched FMA third. I prefer it at a personal level.

>> ARTICLE
I rewatched this about a month ago after several years, and omg it was such a great experience. I had completely forgotten about every single twist and plot points and kept getting awe-struck and gobsmack by every  reveal including those that should have been obvious from my first viewing. Omg I had so much fun. 

10/10 would rewatch again.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god you guys are doing an FMA rewatch >.<

I love FMA >.> 


Dammit I'll just add another animu to my list >.<
>> ARTICLE
shit i rewatched the first 26 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I finished all the episodes in a week. It is a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it twice in one week. Never gets old.
>> ARTICLE
Really excited to start watching! I've watched the first few episodes before, but we skipped the first episode. It was cool, but it felt really weird to be thrown into the action.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree about the dubbed... If you can handle reading subs, the subbed version is really the way to go. 

Then again, I guess id rarely recommend a dub over the original.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty much sub all the way too but with so much praise for the dub, I'm probably gonna use this as an opportunity to check it out.
>> ARTICLE
Most people agree that the dub is ~~better~~ well done. Anyway we don't want to start a sub vs dub war now do we? It is highly likely that you have watched sub first or sub only anyway. Let us enjoy this amazing show.
>> ARTICLE
Did you watch the dub first?

No doubt whatever the first viewings makes us think that whatever VA "is" the character; when I was younger I saw the dub of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away first, so seeing the sub was weird. 

But honestly, Vic Mignogna's voice grates me in a weird way. I'm good with most of the English language VA for FMA/FMAB, and perhaps it's because his voice is so different from Romi Paku's that it was jarring, but to me VM just doesn't fit.

That said, I don't think that there's really anything settled as far as what "most people agree" on regarding this show or most shows, and ultimately the best way to watch an anime is to watch the version that sits with you best, whether that's because you've already seen it that way, you like the actors better in one version, or reading subs takes you out of the visual experience. 
>> ARTICLE
> But honestly, Vic Mignogna's voice grates me in a weird way.

Same! I tried the dub out after hearing so many good things about it and I didn't really see what the hype was about - to me, both Edward's and Mustang's VAs felt very off. Edward just sounded like a bratty and annoying American teenager and Roy felt very... wooden, I guess - not sure how to properly describe it.
>> ARTICLE
I actually watched the sub first then 2 days after I finished it I rewatched it dubbed. I don't know how it happened.
>> ARTICLE
I too rewatch stuff in dubbed

As long as I really like it. A whole new world...
>> ARTICLE
I tried that with Attack on Titan. But Eren's VA sounded like a joke compared to Yuki Kaji. Dropped it fifteen minutes into the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Kid Eren's VA is shit, but adult Eren's VA is better
>> ARTICLE
Bryce Papenbrook... he's your problem. Avoid Sword Art Online and Blue Exorcist in English too. He's a super nice guy but I just cannot enjoy his work. 
>> ARTICLE
>Most people agree that the dub is better. 

>we don't want to start a sub vs dub war now do we?

Uh...
>> ARTICLE
I derped there. Also I edited in things for the choosing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I completely disagree as well, I couldn't watch more than 3 episodes from the dub. Alphonse's original voice is simply perfect, so is Armstrong's.
>> ARTICLE
Ha, I actually really like both versions of Armstrong and feel like they capture him well. I think Edward and most villains tend to be pretty different though. 
>> ARTICLE
the problem is that one tends to miss the action going on-screen while reading subs...in the case of Code Geass while there's a hefty amount of dialogue during the very fast moving action scenes it kind of ruins it
>> ARTICLE
This is a good chance for me to get a second opinion on the show and really think about and discuss it.

OKAY, I have some discussion points:

Pros:

-The action, even in the opening episode, is top tier for battle shonens.
-The character introductions are done perfectly and the exposition is informative without being forced

Cons:

-The animation ranges from beautiful to crappy, with the "crappy" being at the parts where they do comedic things.  Having comedic animation has it's merits but I think it is a little much here.

-As others have pointed out, it feels a little bit too laid back and it is perhaps a bit of an odd choice for a beginning episode.  There are aspects of it that seem like it is a "slice of life", and this can have an effect in capturing the viewer.  I haven't read the manga, maybe it's in there?  I don't know why they didn't start with the Elrich origin story for this series.

Also, I have some concerns about how you are structuring the episode per day numbering.  In my mind, here is how it will be going:

- Episodes 1-15 go for one episode per day.

- Then we have 16-17, 18-19, 20-21, 22-23, 24-25, 26-27, 28-29, 30-31

So then we've passed 30, then we go:

- 32-34, 35-37, 38-40, 41-43, 44-46

So then we've passed 45, then we go:

- 47-50, 51-54, 55-58, 59-62, then we would have to watch 63 and 64 as our last ones.  If I am not mistaken, then this would mean ending the last day with the final two episodes.  

This would probably actually be OK, but if you *really* wanted to end with the final four episodes (which go really well taken in one session) then I would propose:

- 1 Episode per day until episode 12.

- 2 Episodes per day until episode 24

- 3 Episodes per day until episode 48

- 4 Episodes per day until the end of the series.

It is a little skewed but it's not terribly far off from the 15, 30 , 45 structure.  
>> ARTICLE
I think this episode is technically great, and does a great job giving everybody an intro for people to catch up, but thematically I think it was a mistake to have that guy there, because he apparently figured a good portion of the end game plot when it takes a lot of combined time and effort by our heroes to do so.

Also I don't like the Bradley is sinister reveal too early, I think part of the fun of King Bradley is thinking he's a cool old guy, then becoming seriously stressed when thinking about how dangerous he is and his earlier interactions with our heroes.

All that being said, I understand why they needed to compress/skip the earlier arcs.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because it was my second ever anime but I did not expect  [](/s "Bradley to be sinister till later, a bit before it was revealed. Then shit hit the fan and it got super exciting.")
>> ARTICLE
Yo, there's a rewatch of FMA:B going on?  I need to start setting aside time for this
>> ARTICLE
So I have never seen Brotherhood before, but I DID watch this episode when it first aired during the simulcast. And I really didn't like it that much back then. So I never went further than the first episode. The thing is, I watched it without ever seeing the original FMA. A couple years ago I finally got around to watching FMA and it was pretty good. But I've always heard that Brotherhood was so much better, so its been in my PTW for a while. Now, re watching this episode makes a lot more sense. It still jumps right into the middle of things, but now there is context for all the characters and story. I really liked the animation quality and I hope its consistent throughout the series. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the first episode of Brotherhood was essentially made for people who were already fans of the series, to be a more elaborate intro and include more characters than simply starting in Liore would. The Liore episode of FMAB is very similar to the Liore episodes of the original anime and that would put across the wrong message about the series to old fans, I think. They wanted to make sure it distinguished itself early, so it would be seen as something more than just "modern remake of FMA."
>> ARTICLE
The animation gets better. The action scenes are amazing later on. And there are a lot more feels here compared to FMA.
>> ARTICLE
Nice, I needed a reason to rewatch it *again*
>> ARTICLE
I watched the original FMA as my 'gateway anime' and everything spiraled out of control to now. From the comments of this post, I've decided to watch along with you guys!
>> ARTICLE
I really wanna participate, but there's no way I can keep up at one a day, let alone two or three a day. Maybe I'll give it a shot, but I doubt'll I'll keep up. By the way, why exactly was this rewatch started?

Also, I disagree about dubs. They certainly aren't bad, but they're (imo) not even better than the subs, let alone one of the best around. 
>> ARTICLE
The rewatch was started because I felt like it. Should there be any special occasion. And winter season seems like it won't have any great anime.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose that's a good enough reason, I just was wondering if I had perhaps missed some FMA related announcement or if the year 2015 was significant or something.

Holy crap, now that I looked it up, [the events were supposedly set in around 1914-1915 of their time](http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Amestris). If anyone asks again, say we're celebrating FMA's 100 year anniversary ;D
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching FMAB for the very first time just a few days ago. I wish someone had beat me into watching it sooner. There was a time where I forgot I was watching an anime. I was just watching a really great show with such depth and characters that develop something fierce. I really do think it's one of the best I've seen and definitely has a right to that title.
>> ARTICLE
oh god i rewatched this  like 1month ago dammit
>> ARTICLE
Great Fucking Show. So hard to watch 1 Ep A day though! 
>> ARTICLE
How come the alchemist can only specialize in a certain element? It seems more like magic than anything else. For instance, you have the ice alchemist, but why can't other alchemist use ice? 
>> ARTICLE
I think each element needs to be studied in order to use it. I think stuff like metal and earth are basic for everyone to use, but some have secrets for example

[Roy mustang spoiler](/s "flame alchemy. roy had to learn from risa's father in order to use flame alchemy. ")
>> ARTICLE
It's not that other alchemist's can't use ice, it's just that the so called Ice Alchemist is the best/most knowledgeable at it.
>> ARTICLE
Even though it is just filler, I love the bravado of this episode. 


>> ARTICLE
I honestly really wished that we could have seen more of the villain in this episode. His power was quite interesting and unique. Though i realize that he wasn't in the manga(to my knowledge)

>> ARTICLE
I swear the feels are stronger when you rewatch an anime like this. It felt amazing listening to that legendary opening. 
>> ARTICLE
Great first episode, I've seen it probably five times.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this caught me off guard. Perfect timing! I'm burning through Evangelion now and I had this planned next, looks like I'll catch up with you all in a few days! Should I be sure to watch the end of evangelion movie when i finish the series?

This'll be my first time viewing (subbed for sure) so I'm super excited to be watching it with the subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
EoE is very important for Evangelion.
>> ARTICLE
Great Episode
>> ARTICLE
First episode almost turned me off from this anime, I just had no idea what was what and who was what and frankly anything, I never watched the original and this was the 2nd anime I ever watched.

Super glad I stayed.

About to begin this epic saga again, DAMN I'm excited.

Oh ... right now im watching the original Fullmetal Alchemist, after that i wanted to start watching Brotherhood.

Wow as soon as the opening went off a whole bunch of fmab memories came rushing in. So far a very good introduction to the show with a nice balance of seriousness and humor. It kills me to not watch another episode 

>> ARTICLE
Second time watching this. First watched it last year so most of it is fresh in my mind. Should be fun though. Gonna watch the dub this time.
>> ARTICLE
By far one of the, if not the, best anime series I've seen. Them screams in episode 2 are haunting. I really have to commend the actors and actresses who participated because this shit became special.
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily limited to episode 1, but Akira Senju is a god. 
>> ARTICLE
This is great. I was just sitting here thinking I should rewatch Brotherhood instead of the original one.
>> ARTICLE
Arguably the worst episode of the entire series because of how it rushes through tons of the character introductions and is a weak introduction in its own right.

The first ever episode of anime that I ever watched.  Like a month ago.

Ugh... Not gonna watch it dubbed after I seen that scene with Father. What's the best BD sun group for this series?

Well the time has come, [friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5zGkqAWsWE) . I'll never be able to experience this for the first time ever again but truthfully I wouldn't have done it with [anyone but you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E2hYDIFDIU), /r/anime

* It's so quiet...
* So what exactly did these truth sacrifices...well...sacrifice if they are still alive and well?

* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH Hohenheim...before you had my attention, but now, you have my respect
* I have some much hype even Truth couldn't handle it
* Stuff is happening on the screen and there is colours and lights and I love ever minute of it

* I know hohenheim is dying and all but I think I just realized, did thousands of people watch him bang his wife? 
* Episode 64 is just an episode dedicated to ships right? I hope so, I haven't even seen Winry+Ed since so many episodes ago

**Episode 64**

* Ok so him solving the ishabal crisis is cool and all but when is he taking Hawkeye as first lady?

* "A fullmetal heart" 

Phew. Think I need few minutes to let this all settle in...

I don't even have words to describe the mixture of hype, shipment and satisfaction I'm feeling right now. This show is undeniably a 10/10 for me and I'm glad I choose to join in with the rewatchers. Getting the feedback from people who had already seen the show, seeing how my own theories evolved over the course of the series, it's all been amazing. 

10/10, would wear tinfoil again.
>> ARTICLE
They couldn't show Al nude when he came back because everyone would be envious of his massive schlong.
>> ARTICLE
Today i finished watching FMA for the first time. I've been reading your comments alongside. Thank you for your commentary on the series, you caught a lot of things that I didn't. I'll watch NGE and read your comments ts over there too ( I think I read you were doing that too if not ignore this)
Than you
>> ARTICLE
Glad you enjoyed reading these! I didn't really follow the NGE threads until the very end so I think I only posted in the first two threads and then the very last one. Sorry about that, I didn't quite get into the series right away so I ended up lagging behind everyone else and therefore didn't comment.

Have fun watching NGE though!
>> ARTICLE
Ended up watching bakemonogatari but nge is next in the list. Thanks
>> ARTICLE
You made the right choice :D
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget to watch the 4 koma theater
>> ARTICLE
Been lurking this whole time as a first time watcher as well. Managed to stay with these threads despite the temptation to just finish it early. Thoroughly enjoyed reading these on every thread and just helped add to the experience seeing thoughts written out similar to what I was thinking! Appreciate the effort you put in.
>> ARTICLE
I told you from the start that the show would throw all your theories for a loop. It was awesome reading your summary and reactions. Hope to see it again some other time for a different show.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks dude! + If you want you can catch up to NGE it is getting good around episode 15.
>> ARTICLE
I'll do that soon! Can't promise any comments but I will at least give the show a chance at watch it through to the end.
>> ARTICLE
>Screw it, sorry Envy, Greed is the best sin of all time

HAHA. Yes, I knew it! Always count on waiting till episode 63 for everyone to give in.
>> ARTICLE
So... it's been some hours since you've seen the ending, have you noticed something peculiar about Father during the show?

[Extracted from TVTropes](/s "Though it's stated numerous times that Father has expelled all of his sins, it's interesting to note he acts in a way similar to that of the sins: He seeks power at all costs (Greed), views humans as 'ants' (Pride), devours souls with no self-control (Gluttony), has a desire for a family like humans (Envy), prefers to let others do his bidding for him (Sloth), feels anger towards any opposition, principally Hohenheim (Wrath), and lusts after becoming a perfect being (Lust) ")

[](/s "Getting into Mind Screw territory, Father commits at least three of those sins against the corresponding desire. He subjects Sloth to hard labor, steals from Greed (more than once), and treats Pride more like a tool or a trained animal than an ally. A rather disturbing trend, potentially going into Fridge Horror when considering Lust...")
>> ARTICLE
I've spent some time reading previous threads on the show since it ended, with some of these points included. The attention to detail just gets better the more you look into it. 
>> ARTICLE
Won't he keep lust in a platonic relationship going by your logic.
>> ARTICLE
> To all those who have commented on my write-ups, consistently helping me keep up with the discussion and answering my questions, thanks  ;_;

You're welcome :). It was really fun to read your posts and see you experience this masterpiece for the first time. 

Episode 64 had me scared at first, because I was all, something is going to happen, the fight seems to be over but there is still an episode left. Thank god they made episode 64 though, the happy ending really fits here. 

Also, bonus question, who is the best couple/ship of the show. I'll personally go for WinryxEd (Winred? Edry?). I loved their interaction throughout the show.

One other thing. I just saw that they're doing a Shinsekai Yori (re)watch starting now. Since this is one of the 3/4 shows that I would consider better than FMA:B (although they're not really comparable and it is of course personal taste), I suggest you at least try it out. It will also give you a lot of room to create theories, even more so than FMA:B, and has some really nice reveal episodes.
>> ARTICLE
> who is the best couple/ship of the show

Not even Truth knows the answer to that. My personal vote is for Mustang and Hawkeye even though we don't get to see a real conclusion to their ship.

> I just saw that they're doing a Shinsekai Yori (re)watch

I'll put that on my radar. Need to burn through 1 or 2 shows I've been holding back for FMAB first but after that I'm pretty much open to watch anything.
>> ARTICLE
>I'll put that on my radar. 

Woohoo :). No need to hurry, this show is a slow burner. I really hope you'll be posting episode reviews again, because it's really funny to watch. I don't think I can really compare it to any show you have watched, so it'll be something new :)

But first you should finish Gurren Lagann.

On the case!

On a totally unrelated note, I have now officially tagged as Master of tinfoil. (should it be mistress of tinfoil?). Enjoy your honorary title.

That's brilliant :D

I'll let my gender be shrouded in mystery...

Not only see, but you have to think that they also *felt* it because they are a part of his body. Now thats crazy to think about.
>> ARTICLE
Little kids felt it...

;)
>> ARTICLE
First off, thanks for doing these great write-ups every day! You inspired me to get back into writing more, and showed why I like it so much. So, as promised, here is what I was eluding to about the Sins a couple of days ago, in nice, listed format!

Lust: Her bloodlust and need for suffering gave Mustang what he needed to kill her. She even commented on his bloodlust while dying.

Sloth: Worked himself to death. Or possibly he was just too lazy to regenerate, it was rather unclear to me to be honest.

Gluttony: Was eaten, simple enough.

Envy: Killed himself over how envious he was of humanity, the thing he claimed to be better than.

Wrath: Accepted his fate, and while it was an epic battle, he died peacefully.

Pride: Died begging for his life.

Greed: The prospect of the power of God still didn't satisfy him. Instead he sacrificed himself for his "things" or friends.

In the end, while their power was great, the Homunculi had large flaws. Father/Dwarf in the Flask lost because he just removed these things that make humanity strong, instead of embracing and learning from them.
>> ARTICLE
That's great that you found inspiration to create! 

That adds an entirely new perspective on the characters, another reason to like this show :D
>> ARTICLE
There's also some similarities in their deaths to the tortures sinners suffer in the Divine Comedy
>> ARTICLE
I did not know that, I'll have to look into that. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/FullmetalAlchemist/comments/28cli3/irony_behind_the_brotherhood_homunculi_spoilers/ci9qfft)

I should also add that the original Greed being boiled to death is also a reference to the torture
>> ARTICLE
The only failing of FMAB in my book is the choice not to use ["Bratja"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwzAEwzUI8k) in the soundtrack.  It fits the mood of the show like a glove.  Although FMAB's soundtrack is great, it's almost like it played it too safe.  ["Dante's Theme"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLp_wePNrZA) is also such a great song.

All in all, still a 10/10 amazing show, but it doesn't overshadow original FMA completely.  First time watchers, watch the original too!
>> ARTICLE
I love Bratja, but the recurring lyrical theme in Brotherhood ([Trisha's Lullaby](http://youtu.be/l2kwie-gs2o)) is also one of my favorites. (Fun fact, Bratja is one of the few pieces I can play on the piano!)
>> ARTICLE
They could actually have used it several times during the show. It would also fit perfectly with the FMA:B OST.
Nevertheless, both soundtracks are stellar and I go back listening to them regularly.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah! Use it during the Ed/Al training montages like in the original or something.  As to why they didn't, it's possible it would have been a legal hassle, but one well worth it imo.
>> ARTICLE
For some fun, here's an [altertnate fanart](http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=2930257) that combines the main antagonists and the homunculi from both versions of FMA.  

So all in all, quite a satisfying conclusion. Things are wrapped up nicely, with NO HANGING THREADS (the biggest problem with FMA original).

And only watched two opf the OVAs- The Blind Alchemist (which would fit right in as an original anime episode) and Tales of the Teacher (which is a nice backstory for Izumi, with quite a silly conclusion).  
>> ARTICLE
Greed's death was the most emotional for me. Dude was MVP for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
I just want to say thank you for doing this rewatch! I haven't been able to catch up yet because of school, but if it wasn't for this rewatch I would have probably waited years before watching this. It's an amazing anime!
>> ARTICLE
Man I had FMA:B pinned as a 9/10 throughout the series, but the last few episodes really pushed it over the edge and into 10/10. I was so teary eyed the last couple episodes, and it's just got the perfect ending. Left nothing to be desired, everything just was so great.

It's been a journey, watching this with all of you...I'm really glad I got the chance to watch this. Thank you, xArDDe for doing this. 
>> ARTICLE
No 4 koma theater discussion? [Screw it, I'm sharing it anyways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvkI4trmoN4&list=PL_zzCODVmJMKn-o1NDCtNZGJrKoR6L6lk)

[Also because I can, here are all the openings and endings of FMA 2003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWAZGbeg1kI) (I only really like the first opening and the second ending, overall I find that Brotherhood has better OP and ED but that first OP in FMA 2003), for those that didn't see FMA 2003 and want to, if you don't want to see possible spoilers, skip OP 3 and 4 since those have Wrath and Sloth which are anime original homunculus
>> ARTICLE
I tend to agree with popular opinion that first OP of Brotherhood is the best. That being said I actually prefer the soundtrack of 2003. The orchestral epicness we get in Brotherhood is great, but IMO it doesn't compare with the raw emotional music from the original (Dante's Theme is one of my favorite songs in anime).
>> ARTICLE
My favorite of the 4koma theaters is [Scar's and Wrath's true names](http://youtu.be/pSry_sK1XEg?t=2m24s) (starts at 2:24). It's a reference to [an old Japanese folktale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugemu).
>> ARTICLE
Oh God, it's raining in my room! 

I just wanna say I went into this expecting it to be just another overhyped show, but man have I ever been happier to be proven wrong. 10/10 will watch again!
>> ARTICLE
So is this in your top 3. It will surely stay in mine forever. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a 10/10 for sure. It isn't actually in my top 3 though, Steins;Gate/Madoka Magica/Mawaru Penguindrum/Shinsekai Yori are still better. Or at least I enjoyed them better, although it's quite hard to differentiate between 10/10s.
>> ARTICLE
I quite disliked Madoka ;/ But different tastes. Madoka's characters were bad.
>> ARTICLE
Let's just agree that we have different tastes :P No need to start a discussion about a different anime in the thread for FMA:B.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 63 fucking broke me. I haven't really straight out cry for an anime since AnoHana, the last scenes of Hohenheim did it. I just had to go to the bathroom after that and clean my face before seeing anyone in the house.

This anime was awesome, one of the bests without a doubt. 10/10

> Why would Mustang even bother with clapping for his flames? He can just... snap his fingers for that.

He could only just snap his fingers because of the alchemy circles on his gloves. The gloves were destroyed when Wrath pinned him down, so he can't do that anymore.

>How come Ed's arm is still muscular and Al's body wasn't?

If you look at the arm, you notice that it's considerably skinnier than his other arm and also had longer fingernails.
>> ARTICLE
cal me dumb but i didnt know that FMAB had special episodes, whats the setting of these episodes, is it after the series end or during?
>> ARTICLE
Mostly before, The Blind Alchemist could be considered during, the rest are definitely before
>> ARTICLE
I have just finished Hagane no. What to do with my life now? It's now the best anime I have ever seen, closely followed by Kill La Kill, HxH, AnoHana etc in that order
>> ARTICLE
There are still left very good anime, dont panic!

Does anyone else just feel really underwhelmed by this anime? Like it's not bad by any means but it's just not as great as you expected it to be? I've shown to a bunch of people and they all say the same

Thanks for the rewatch. I've mainly been lurking but the discussion had been fun to read

>> ARTICLE
I might pick up this anime again, but I already dropped it 4 times and couldn't get past episode 7...

I mean I've only heard good things about it but it's probably the most boring anime I've ever watched... Yet people seem to actually enjoy it and call it a masterpiece. I don't fucking understand man.
>> ARTICLE
Most boring anime? Man, how many anime have you watched. Also going into an anime expecting it to be a masterpiece will ruin you. It is your fault you aren't enjoying it.
>> ARTICLE
I dont have a MAL but judging by my anime folder alone I'd say 150+ series (easily). I've been a pretty hardcore watcher for the past 5 years. Fma:bh is actually one of the few anime I've dropped, in a pile of maybe 6-7 anime among the names of rolling girl (this season), watamote, sasami@, guilty crown, a couple of crap ecchi, and some other crap ive long forgotten. I also never went into the series expecting a masterpiece, as I was simply recommended it by a friend of mine in my early days of anime and didn't know there was such a huge community following. However after I found out it was top 3, I picked it up again and it was flat-out boring. Fast forward 4 years and I've got no internet stuck in china with all the episodes on my hard drive and decided to give it another chance to see if my taste has refined. Nope, I couldn't bear watching it. I'm seriously in awe of how people can sit through this thing, because even if it gets better later, the first 7 episodes turn me off from watching the whole thing. It's funny because I have yet to meet another person who didn't enjoy the anime.
>> ARTICLE
You can say that didn't enjoy the anime and it wasn't good after watching it. :P
>> ARTICLE
To be honest I forced myself through the first 15 episodes. After that I couldn't stop. So the first episodes aren't something you should go on from.
>> ARTICLE
I actually heavily dislike the art, characters, setting, tone and shounen themes from the first few episodes. I don't think half of those would change dramatically over the next 60 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Character cast is one of the best. The setting and tone change, they don't stick with the awful comedy. Shounen? The first time watching this I didn't even know it was a shounen. 
>> ARTICLE
The reason FMA Brotherhood is always rated so high isn't because it's the best anime of all time, but because it has such a broad appeal. You can be any age, any gender, and have an interest in any genre, and you will still probably enjoy it
>> ARTICLE
 The story holds up for the whole run with a satisfying and complete ending. The large group of characters are all interesting in their own ways. Too many shows either drag on, are cut short, or have too many loose ends. Brotherhood is as close to being like a good epic novel as anything on TV.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably also that it's relatively accessible, even to a western audience.  We don't need to understand a huge list of historical references and in-jokes, because it relies on a freshly-built world.
>> ARTICLE
If a show has such a broad appeal and regarded as a great anime by such a huge amount of people(which very few shows have achieved), why can't we just call it the greatest anime of all time?
>> ARTICLE
It depends on how you define "greatest". FMA: B appeals to pretty much every anime fan, but pretty much every anime fan has a show that appeals to them more than FMA: B
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. It's not the very best at any one thing, but basically everything it does, it does extremely well, and has such a wide range of appealing pieces that people drawn in by just one thing end up enjoying a solid whole.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't agree more. It has something going on for all kind of fans and is pretty easy to digest. There are no huge faults that would turn people off from it either. I have it rated as 10/10 myself but I don't think its one of the strongest 10s I have.
>> ARTICLE
Also, don't underestimate the fact that it got a great English dub and a lot of air time on Toonami. This made it very accessible for a lot of casual anime fans.
>> ARTICLE
Great English dub was key to getting a lot of people in North America to watch. I don't think the Toonami thing helped that much, but definitely having that dub cast helped expand to the casual fan
>> ARTICLE
It's one of the few (or many?) where I'd consider the dub cast better than the Japanese. Though I only watched a few minutes with subs before I realized I hated Al's voice and switched, so I can't comment on the whole thing.
>> ARTICLE
If I am not mistaken it's one of those really rare instances where a female artist captures to the core a shounen type of manga/anime.

It's amazing, I have huge respect for the artist/author. She knows exactly what to write so that it's accessible to a general audience.
>> ARTICLE
That and D-Gray Man, maybe, stands as some of the few shounen series written/drawn by women. 
>> ARTICLE
D-Gray Man seemed to have fallen into the great pits of Oh-Great after a certain point.

The plot got really really convoluted.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle by Clamp considered a shounen?
>> ARTICLE
It's really not as uncommon as people think. Blue Exorcist and Magi are both drawn by women iirc. 
>> ARTICLE
The recently finished Pandora Hearts too. It's definitely not an even amount of mangaka of each gender writing shonen but yeah it's not as incredibly uncommon as is assumed.
>> ARTICLE
My heart aches so bad whenever anyone reminds me of D.Grayamn. I really need closure with this series. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually believe the fact that the mangaka is a woman plays a big part in the anime having such a broad appeal because she created well-written female characters which is something that is so often missing in shonen unfortunately (/u/FateSteelTaylor wrote a really great comment bellow about the characters which I whole-heartily agree with).

There's no fanservice and there's no female character only existing for the sake of being the damsel in distress and that made it so much easier for me to get into the story. 


That's why I think a big part of FMA:B being so well-like is the fact that it can appeals to both gender, whereas a lot of other good animes have a more specific target demographic and thus won't achieve the same rating.

Also, it's a great story with magic and ninja fights.
>> ARTICLE
This is pretty much what i can ask for an anime to be. There isn't any fanservice, the plot is entertaining and the animation is pretty good. A great anime overall.

There's not *much* fanservice.

Was that scene in the Manga?

Tasteful fanservice is best anyway.

She had to be naked in the tub to advance the story

One scene in 60+ episodes is less then "not much" IMO. 

My point was that you don't get tits and ass thrown in your face at every turn and for no reason 
in regard to the plot. No boob squeeze or panty shots, the annoying and gratuitous kind of fanservice.

I think there's a distinction between having a scene with a character in a certain level of nakedness and fanservice. In the anime, we also see the naked body of Al waiting at the "door", but I don't think anyone would consider that fanservice for example.
>> ARTICLE
How about Mustang without his shirt? Or all of the times Ed takes off his shirt? Fanservice need not be just female characters. 
>> ARTICLE
Shirtless Edward Elric <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
>> ARTICLE
Fanservice is  certainly not gender specific, but nakedness =/= fanservice. 

The only time I can recall Mustang being shirtless is after his fight with Lust, and it was because he had to burn his wound to prevent himself from bleeding out (thus he had to button down his shirt to practice alchemy on himself). It makes sense, it's not gratuitous.

When Edward is shirtless it's generally to show his automail. The way the body is shown in the scene matter too for it to be considered fanservice I think. For example, you don't get a slow-mo shot zoomed in on his torso with a pastel color background or another character in the scene oogling him.
>> ARTICLE
Basically, fanservice mainly aimed at the female audience here. Not much at the male audience.
>> ARTICLE
Showing skin isn't fanservice unless it's sexualized. You can easily tell the difference. 
>> ARTICLE
You seem to think any character showing some skin is fanservice, regardless of whether or not it is justified by the plot. I don't agree with that definition.


Of the instances that have been mentioned in this thread, I think only the Winry bath scene fits the criteria of fanservice. Ed fighting and having his clothes torn off by an ennemy attack which is used as a way of revealing that he has an automail for his right arm is not fanservice IMO. 


Maybe there are other instances I can't recall, but if I can't remember them than that means there weren't too blatant and distracting from the story like fanservice tends to be.
I don't mind nudity, I mind overly-suggestive-for-no-good-reasons-other-than-to-please-the-audience scenes.
>> ARTICLE
If a woman had her clothes torn off in a similar way you'd be calling it fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
> a slow-mo shot zoomed in on his torso with a pastel color background or another character in the scene oogling him.

You might not get that with Ed, but... [(   )](http://www.fullmetal-alchemist.com/forums/uploads/1173597067/gallery_43623_1090_30538.jpg)

The link is broken unfortunately. Who was it supposed to be?
>> ARTICLE
Alex Louis Armstrong.
>> ARTICLE
A certain kind of fanservice that's been passed down the Armstrong line for generations ;)
>> ARTICLE
What would you say of Alex Armstrong? His instances of flexing his muscles is mostly humorous but could be construed as being at least a little fanservicey.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure he's the artist's ideal body build for a man. 
>> ARTICLE
I was actually wondering about him earlier. He definitely gets those "slow-mo shot zoomed in on his torso with a pastel color background" scenes every time he gets into a fight.

It fits the description of fanservice but like you said it's meant to be humorous, so is it still fanservice in that case? I'm not sure to be honest.

It didn't really feel like fanservice to me, though I do remember thinking it was getting annoying and felt really unnecessary after the 5th time we saw him getting shirtless and flexing his muscles while talking about his family heritage.

The interesting thing is that he is not drawn as the traditional female ideal of a man. I think most of us wouldn't consider him handsome and he's also way too muscular. If fanservice is supposed to be about giving the audience what they want, is it fanservice if a character is often portrayed shirtless (with all the traditional elements of fanservice), even if he's not conventionally attractive? 
>> ARTICLE
Saying he's way too muscular is like saying a girl has way too large breasts. Might be true for you but probably doesn't apply to everyone's preferences. Fanservice of female characters can be kinda played tongue in cheek for humor too and I would still consider that fanservice. So I'd probably still count Alex Armstrong although I will say in either way, FMA doesn't seem to have any fanservice that negatively detracts from the series no matter what your definition of that term is. 
>> ARTICLE
It's the Shawshank Redemption being the #1 film on IMDB. Is it the best film ever made? For most people probably not, but it has such a wide appeal to many and doesn't do anything wrong in order for people to hate it.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is that trying to define something as "the best show/movie/game/whatever ever" is kinda pointless. What is the metric for entertainment quality? How many people likes it? How many people thinks of it as their favorite? How many established critics think of it as a masterpiece (and how do you even define what an established critic is)?

And another problem: To make an educated attempt at finding the best anime, one would have to see ALL of them. And that isn't quite feasible.
>> ARTICLE
This is probably the best answer out there. Well said.
>> ARTICLE
I think a big part of it is probably how easy it is to get into it.

An anime fan can easily watch the show and absolutely love it, but so can somebody who isn't really into anime.

The dub's good, it's not too "Japan-y," and it stays pretty grounded in the rules that it sets early on.
>> ARTICLE
It's an amazingly well done series, with such an ambitious plot and fleshed out cast of character it's hard to end up really "hating the show". It never really stumbles over its own size, and leaves no stone unturned by the end, which is quite the astounding feat given the scale. 

It might not be everybody's favorite, but it certainly ends up being rated highly by a lot of people simply because of the quality is so good. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty well crafted "hero's journey."  Characters have flaws, find a way to cope with them, and you can see the passage of time.
>> ARTICLE
WARNING: What lies ahead is full of spoilers, my biased opinions, and as always, analysis that might just be BS in the end. But it is how I view FMA:B, which is apparently what you asked for, so here's your heads up.   
  
This is purely from the viewpoint of FMA:B and a little bit of the manga (I haven't seen the 2003 version nor have I played any of the games, so I can't speak to those). Having watched the show both sub and dub at least three times each (and the manga front to back too many times to count), I'm relying mostly on my memory for this, so please feel free to correct me if I slip up.   
  
 FMA is different from the norm for a variety of reasons: it's an action shounen written by a woman, there's little emphasis on fanservice, it is very much based in a "Western" world, from the names to the city structures, etc. And while these alone aren't enough to set it such high esteem, they do contribute. I believe there are four aspects that make FMA: B so highly respected: its wealth of characters, storyline structure, symbolism, and rewatchability.    
  
1 - Well-Developed Characters (especially women!)   
What I bring up first when I try to get people to watch FMA is the characters in this world. Each and every one of them is so well written and cared for that by the end, you can see them for their worth. For a series whose genre dictates more of an emphasis on action and battles, the story takes care to pace its characters in such a way that it reveals aspects about them that you never could have imagined in the beginning, twists them, and then twists them again. We know Edward and Alphonse are the main characters, and they rightly grow up before our eyes. Edward starts off as a very brash kid who recklessly jumps into battle and by the end... well, okay, that doesn't change much. But we see time and time again how he cares for people, and he continually says the right thing at the right time, from telling Winry that her hands were meant to heal and not hurt, believing in his father at the end, and even giving up alchemy. Of the two, though, I love Alphonse's path much more. Even after he helps save the world, his failure to save Nina keeps him grounded. When they're at the caf towards the end, that one failure is enough to have him keep searching. And really, Al gets a lot of shit throughout the series. One of Greed's henchmen is brutally murdered by Bradley *while she's still inside his suit of armor*, he has to question whether or not his memories are genuine, he endured a blizzard and total darkness with Selim, and yet despite all his bad luck, he continued to have a positive attitude on life. He recognizes he has a disability, but he doesn't allow it to control him; Alphonse controls what should hinder him and turns it into a weakness. He also shows he's not just some moral savior who's too good to use an advantage. When he's fighting Pride with the chimeras, he uses a Philosopher's Stone despite his earlier resistance because he recognizes it will save more lives and it's the purely rational thing to do. He also does this when he sacrificed his soul to get Edward back his arm. (Sidenote: How fucking metal is that? No pun intended.) Of course, we also know how great Roy Mustang is and Maes Hughes, but I feel like Scar and King Bradley don't get enough of their due. Scar starts off as the bad guy who murdered Winry's parents... and ends up joining the good guys because hey, being wrong before doesn't mean it's too late for you to make things right. It doesn't come easily for him, either, but at his heart, he understands that the best way to honor his memory is not to seek vengeance, but continue his work. As for Bradley, we're wary at him from his murder of Isaac McDougal, but he seems like such a cheery uncle kinda guy... until we realize he ordered the genocide of Ishval, offs some of our favorite characters, then offers up great lines ("As you can see, I've been dealt a mortal blow. Now which one of you will be the one to end the king's life?"/"Race, gender, origin, name, none of that matters now."/"Every choice in my life was made for me... except her. My wife was my one choice. That's what it means to be married. You would do well to remember that."), before dying a badass death.   
  
But what's really great are the women in this show. It's rare, at least in my experience, to find such well developed and well written women in shounen. Take Winry. In any other show, her role would simply be "support MC," but here, she takes control of her own destiny. She forces her way into Rush Valley to become a highly valued mechanic, she comes up with the plan for Scar to take her hostage, she is the one who ultimately agrees to give her life to Edward using logic he had never thought of before. Riza joins the military of her own reasoning, forced Mustang to erase the records of flame alchemy so no one ever has his kinda power, she is the one who stops him from killing Envy out of hatred and losing his way, and she is the one who keeps Mustang from committing human transmutation, who aims for him when he is blind. The future most powerful man in the country trusts one person with his back completely, and that person is Riza Motherfuckin Hawkeye. Oh, and Lan Fan cut off her fucking arm to save her lord (and thereby any chance of saving her clan) and started using automail within six months after hearing puny Edward did it in a year. Fucking A, these characters are badass and where we would normally see weak and underdeveloped stand-ins, we get full fledged characters who can hold their own just as well as anyone. For more on this, just look up feminist Fullmetal Alchemist essays that serve as character profiles on those gals. It's fuckin rad. (Continued in reply)
>> ARTICLE
For me, world building and character writing are tied for "most important" in a series. To pick up on your commentary on female characters: it is important to note that while all the females were badass, that wasn't their only quality. Many series suffer from assuming badass females = good female character writing. *Every* character in the series had their own badass qualities as well as their own faults, flaws, and weaknesses. Further, the characters had distinctive personalities. Every character was genuine to themselves and their beliefs. Their independent actions and their interplay were phenomenal. The series also had a good balance of "show and tell" to convey all of the character information as well, which some series are lack severely. Further, the characters were not broken for plot or story convenience. Too many series try to slip up characters to make way for a nuance, or even large element, to drive the plot the way they want it to go. Your characters are allowed to change, and this change can be rapid depending on the scenario, but you can't have a lapse of character.
>> ARTICLE
2 - Storyline Structure.  
  
Alright so it's getting late here and I'm on mobile because I'm on vacation but screw it this essay is gonna get written. Anyway, the storyline is another aspect that could have left FMA:B flat on its face, but instead serves as another strength. It deftly handled characters who are all over the map at different times (from Edward recovering to Al with the chimeras to Roy pulling the strings at central in the lead up to the end). And everything that gets brought up in the beginning has its place at the end, like the aforementioned swap of Alphonse's soul for Edward's arm (also fucking Mei fully committed to sacrificing the life of the man she loves to save the world), the mentions of Ishval and the presence of the homunculi throughout time, the bits and pieces of Father, the set up of Selim as a homunculus (also that amazing scene of Riza and Roy talking in code), Maria Ross's fake burning and her return, Havoc being consigned to a wheelchair but still contributing in any way he can to the man he committed his life to, Bradley's hands shaking at Hughes's funeral only for it to be revealed as anger later, Hoenhein's counter circle, etc. Every aspect of this story has a purpose and will be brought back later, which asks its viewers to think deeply whenever they watch something, just in case it might come back later.    
  
It also deals well with very human emotions, and features, in what can be at times a very funny and light hearted show, some of the saddest and most terrifying moments. We all know about Maes's death and Nina the chimera, but don't forget Armstrong's inability to stop anything in the Ishval war despite having all this strength, Captain Buccaneer's heroic death (with two of my favorite lines of all time: "How about we walk King Bradley down to hell together?"/"There's a place that's just a little higher than the peak of Mt. Briggs. I will see you there."), Greed offering his Philospher's Stone but unable to save the old man's life, Izumi Curtis and the loss of her child and the relief that comes when she realizes that the thing she brought back wasn't her baby again, the hopelessness Riza feels when she thinks Roy is dead, Envy's suicide, etc. All of these are times where it has (from what can tell) successfully conveyed emotions and feelings that most of us are lucky enough to never ensure in real life.    
  
3 - Symbolism.  
   
There was clearly a lot of research done going into this series. You can easily find posts of people detailing the parallels between the deaths of the homunculi and Dante's Divine Comedy. The references to Nazi Germany are not hard to follow, nor are many other aspects of the themes FMA portrays: togetherness, forgiveness, questioning your basic assumptions, recognizing the "other" is not so different from you. This stuff requires its own essay and I'm suddenly not about that life (at least for now).   
  
4 - Rewatchability  
  
Despite the plot twists it takes, FMA:B doesn't suffer as a result because of those on a rewatch. Instead, I've found it only enhances the experience. We, the viewers, can more easily pick up on Bradley and Selim's tics early on, we can sympathize with Scar's revenge streak, we know what Hoenheim is doing walking all around. Suddenly, we're not so much focused on trying to pick up everything that happens along the ride and instead can choose to enjoy and delve into whatever aspect piques our interest the next time around... and with all that went into this series, you can never be quite finished with details to discover. 
>> ARTICLE
While FMA Brotherhood isn't my personal favorite anime ever, still earns a 10/10 on my list and I can definitely see why many people do consider it so and why it is consistently top-rated. I finished the series about a month ago, having not seen the previous adaptation or read the manga. I tried to think about what made FMA: B unique and stand out from all the other anime I've seen. If I had to single out the defining feature that made FMA: B great for me, it is probably that the show is simply really well-balanced. The show does a great job of balancing character development, story progression, action sequences, and even some feelsy moments without ever making one aspect seem too drawn out or feeling undeveloped/ignored. I could easily talk about a slew of things that made the show great such as compelling characters, an epic story, great themes, and excellent voice/animation. But for the sake of time, I'll stick to the one aspect which I enjoy above all else in anime: the characters.

 FMA: B has a massive cast whose stories take place all over the country and it still amazes me that every single character feels fully fleshed out and realized. No one with a name is created simply to be that guy who gets 1-shot by the villain just so the protagonists see that the bad guy ain't messin' around! Each character has a unique backstory, goal, and motive to drive what he/she does. While it is absolutely impossible for each episode to feature every single character, each person is given enough relevance and development so that no one ever feels sidelined. 

One aspect of character development FMA: B absolutely nails is its utilization of the age-old (yet easily forgotten) storytelling mechanic, "showing and not simply telling." We've all seen those shonen anime moments when the protagonist shows the bad guy mercy. The bad guy realizes the error in his ways and swears that he will change. And then he leaves and we never see him again. It is implied that the bad guy becomes a better person but the rest is up to our imagination. In FMA: B, we actually see the characters change. We see them take action to change and we see the results of their efforts. For example, let's take a look at Rose (though not really a villain in this case), a fairly minor character whom our protagonists meet early in their adventure. When Edward and Alphonse meet her, she is a devout follower of a phony priest who subverts his followers for influence and power through deception and false promises. After the priest is revealed for who he is, Rose is crushed from the betrayal, but is encouraged by the brothers to take control of her life and move forward. Now in most anime, this should be the last we hear of Rose. Her story arc is concluded, what she does next is left to the viewers' imagination and the story moves on. 

However, imagine my surprise when 20-30some episodes later, the brothers return to the town and we meet Rose again, who is helping rebuild the town and feeding the hungry! Her reappearance was by no means necessary, but the continuity here helps sell the world and the characters so much more. I really felt that the characters of this world were real people with lives and emotions rather than simply NPC's who serve to move the plot along. What is amazing is that I can cite this kind of continuity and development in just about every character we meet. Rose is simply the first minor character I thought about. I could easily go on about bigger characters like Winry's relationship with Scar, Ling Yao's unique alliance with Greed, or Envy's jealousy of humanity. 

In summary, part of what makes FMA: B great for me is the attention and care given to its characters. Even minor side characters are well-developed and as result, everyone truly feels significant in the world. Just realized this is my first ever post in /r/anime :)! I apologize for the giant wall of text. I'm interested in knowing what everyone else thinks made FMA: B so great. Feel free to share!  

>> ARTICLE
I think story progression is the absolute key!
>> ARTICLE
Is it truly the best anime series ever created? No.

Is it widely regarded as extremely great by a very large amount of people? Yes.
>> ARTICLE
It's a shonen with an ending.
>> ARTICLE
Nicely summed up.
>> ARTICLE
No, it just doesn't have enough people that *dis*like it enough to give it a bad score, unlike all the other good anime.
>> ARTICLE
So it means from what are you saying,  that most people who watched liked or loved it and few dislike it ? isn't that the definition of being good. 


>> ARTICLE
Yes, but that is only one of few ways of quantifying "good" literature. It also doesn't make it the best anime out there, (see /u/pittman66's comment) and additionally there are a lot of stupid people that dislike good anime and then rate them a 1 just because they're popular. Like NGE, Madoka Magica, and Kill la Kill. FMAB does not have this problem because it's pretty standard and has wide appeal. 
>> ARTICLE
Kill La Kill is bad though. Like, its got subpar animation, poor fight choreography, the pacing collapses midway through and slows down to a crawl for several episodes, and the show is generally poorly written.

Its only really good from a pure 'turn off your brain and be entertained' angle, but even then there are shows that are far better for that - like TTGL. Comparing it to Evangelion or Madoka is just inaccurate, and I don't even really like Madoka all that much since other shows have done nearly everything it tried to much better.
>> ARTICLE
Paging /u/7teenwriters

Sorry, not exactly sober right now so I'm not the best person to mount a defense. 
>> ARTICLE
dont make us call the great slayer of shitposters
>> ARTICLE
Being fair, "turn off your brain and be entertained" is exactly what KLK was going for. It was entirely self aware, and that's what I liked about it. The animation quality, choreography, etc. is pretty subjective. I'll admit it wasn't absolutely gorgeous the same way Fate/Stay Night was, but it fit the campy, satirical tone they wanted.
>> ARTICLE
You and he are kind of ignoring all the overtones of empowerment against shame and rebellion against conformity, in the same way someone might miss how FLCL was all about puberty.
>> ARTICLE
Well of course, if you turn off your brain you miss all of it's uninteresting, weak and barely explored themes/excuses for the fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
Also it appeals to people just starting out with anime who tend to rate every show they see a 9 or 10 at the start, then they never go back to change afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
There's a few problems with anime ratings on websites. These biases mean that certain kinds of shows end up rated highly while arguably superior shows will have more mid-range scores.

First is survivorship bias. Longer shows tend to have higher scores because the people that finish them tend to be the ones that like them. On websites like MAL if you don't watch at least a certain percentage of the show your score doesn't count, so the people who didn't like it probably didn't watch enough to have their votes bring down the score. I believe MAL is 20%, so for FMA:B you have to watch 13-14 episodes and then drop it for your score to count. Very few people are going to get that far in and then drop the series because they didn't like it. I think this is likely the strongest bias and one that is present in almost all of the top 25 series.

Second is inflation of ratings of people new to the medium. There is usually a honeymoon period where people are watching anime for the first time and tend to rate things higher because it is a novel experience. Shows that are more accessible tend to be the ones people watch first (especially those that are dubbed and/or appeared on the viewer's home TV networks).

Beyond that shows like FMA:B are going to have broad appeal and not generate the kinds of strong reactions that some other works might, so there are fewer people purposefully downvoting it.

These are largely why I don't look at scores when determining what to watch. I prefer to rely on reviews from people who think like me or be exposed to a series through gifs or short clips and get interested that way. The only time a score influences my decision is if it is universally low though even then I've watched some shows rated on the lower end (around ~7.0 on MAL) that I still enjoyed, so even that isn't necessarily a good indicator.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it does deserve its position. All the shows that I consider better than FMA are "polarizing".[1] They have many detractors and flaws. FMA is very good, and I would argue that it has less flaws than many "better" shows, even if it doesn't reach the same heights as those shows.

As well, it's very often a show that people watch early in their anime career, when they are just getting into the hobby. So it gets a glow from being a good memory.

I mean, what show should be at the top of these lists? Why not a very good show with few flaws, that is enjoyed by the vast majority of the audience. If a show is second-best in all elements, is it better than a show which is first in some elements, and 10th in others?

[1] Well, maybe not Cross Game. But not enough people have seen Cross Game.
>> ARTICLE
I have never heard of Cross Game, but after skimming some reviews on MAL I think I'll give it a whirl after my current shows are done. Thanks for the introduction!
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game is actually my second favorite, right after FMAB. They both pace things well and have great characters, just a couple small things keeping Cross Game from being my number one.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing that, as a lot of people have said, it's those "couple small things" that prevent some shows from taking the spot that FMA:B occupies.
>> ARTICLE
Putting aside exciting sci-fi alchemy being a new twist on magic, it boils down to one thing. 

* Cohesive world-building.

It is the same reason why Avatar: The Last Airbender is critically acclaimed in Western society despite being an animation. 

From the alchemy to the characterization to the plot itself, everything is molded for the world's thesis rather than attached arbitrarily to fulfill the writer's whim. This level of planning is why Arakawa's next work, Silver Spoon, was an instant success even though it fantasy thrills of FMA.

That is why others are saying it has broad appeal. Everything fits together, so little air time is spent lecturing about how things work. It can all be presented or stated in an intuitively accessible manner. 

This level of consistency, simplicity, and deepness is what gives it the broad appeal to be #1.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the best in any one aspect, but it's extremely good in all areas.  That makes it very hard to people to find fault with it and give it a lower rating.  Its western setting also makes it more accessible to casual Western fans.

As to whether it deserves it...I don't know, man.  It's one of several shows that you could argue deserves it, but it's not head and shoulders the best show out there.  It's overrated, but not by much.
>> ARTICLE
Well one of the reasons would be simply, it's practically a perfect show.Everything it attempts to do or convey is perfect...the only thing it doesn't do well was comedy unfortunately.
>> ARTICLE
Comedy? I thought the comedic moments were highly appreciated by the fandom. Although I have to agree that during the first half there's way too much comedy mixed with drama. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, aside from its broad appeal, it just gets so many things *right*.

It brings up politics without botching it. It introduces female characters without botching them. It even brings up issues of race without botching that too. Plus it has great world building and doesn't force us to sit through long lectures about it. It shows not tells.

It just. Wow. So much is fantastic, man. For serious.
>> ARTICLE
Agree. It's masterfully executed and never feels forced or shoehorned.
>> ARTICLE
For me it's not even a matter of feeling forced or shoehorned in; it's just that sometimes, other shows get it all wrong.

Not anime but in The Legend of Korra, they really dropped the ball on the "Equalists" plot. In Naruto (back to anime again) Kishimoto would always talk about how "great" a kunoichi that Sakura was, but he never followed through with it. She is the poster child for a pseudo-action girl.

As for Race, I've seen My Little Pony handle it terrible. Like the episode when Zecora (the Zebra) came to town; they tried to frame their prejudices as just plain "fear", or a "misunderstanding", but actual irl race issues are more than that.

Anyway sorry to ramble! I'm basically saying that FMA did not screw up with any of these; with the exception of LGBT issues, in which the only gay/trans/etc character in the entire series is a flaming stereotype :/
>> ARTICLE
LGBT in FMAB? Envy??
>> ARTICLE
Oh, no I was thinking about [Garfiel](http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Garfiel).

But that's a good point actually! It could be argued that Envy is androgynous, non-binary, or a non-gender-conforming male. Maybe something else entirely...I don't consider Envy a stereotype, that's for sure!
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that guy, so minor I barely remember him... I wonder why anime always tends to include that kind of flamboyant males when they want to add a gay character. 
>> ARTICLE
I think a part of what is good about it is that it is so easy to get into as well as because it doesn't have many faults. You see most good anime are super super great in some regards but then are really bad in others. Fullmetal Alchemist both versions are not like that they lose one super so they are only super great but they are in almost everything.
>> ARTICLE
Cause it followed the manga storyline. It could have done a better job but overall it told a fantastic story full of excellent characters. Its one of those that you can watch endlessly.
>> ARTICLE
A copy-paste of my comment on another thread.

*I think people sing praises too much about FMA. I mean, I hate how it change tone from a grim fantasy type of story to some mellow defeat final boss and all conflict resolved with no repercussion. Yeah while there are consequences and such but I think it was quite minor compared to the grand scale it was showing in the beginning of the series where morality,nationality and humanity stands at a very blurry line.*

It's like suddenly all these philosophical and intellectual subtext (order vs morality in the war/human experimentation/ power exploit through use of religion/ethnic conflicts) was suddenly dumped into a basket of trash in the end.
>> ARTICLE
It's an accessible (mostly) and fun, straightforward action adventure with a great cast and an epic as hell final act. That basically sums it up.

Now, the second question? Absolutely not. I can think of several anime better/more "perfect" and more thoughtful than FMAB off the top of my head.
>> ARTICLE
Which ones would say are better? Now I'm curious.
>> ARTICLE
In no particular order: Steins;Gate, Madoka Magica, Monster, Gankutsuou, Cowboy Bebop.

There are several others I would include as well, but they're much more debatable, though I do firmly personally believe they are better than FMAB.
>> ARTICLE
 I agree with everyone, it has broad appeal, but it is also a great anime. I would give it a 9/10 overall.
>> ARTICLE
is it one of the best of all time? 100% from start to finish it is nothing but great
>> ARTICLE
Your problem is that you think MAL's ranking means anything.

The ranking isn't some all knowing, 100% objective measure. It doesn't even attempt it. It's subject to countless human biases.

People don't finish shows they don't like. They drop it and forget that it even exists so they never even bother to rate it. Because they're not rated, the only ratings that are LEFT are people who already enjoy it and finished it.

Then you have most of the anime fanbase being young people with shit taste. They come into anime and think everything is the greatest thing ever. That's why everything is rated 8/10, 9/10, 10/10. 

On top of that, people don't even attempt to be objective about their reviews. They just base it on how they feel or how much they "enjoyed it." "I really liked SAO so it's a 10/10 show!" Then you have a better show like Brotherhood come along and that's a 10/10, also, to them. Then what the fuck is the point of a 10/10 then?

I understand what you're saying, but if we don't count ranking, what other tools do we have to measure an anime's perception? Google trends?
>> ARTICLE
Ask yourself what you want from a "ranking."

Do you want it to measure how many people like versus dislike it? Then it's easy. Do what YouTube does. A binary "Like/Dislike" system. It's extremely easy for users. Rating a show on MAL is a lot of fucking work compared to YouTube. 

Back when YT had a 5 star rating, they noticed that people either vote 1 or 5 stars or don't vote at all. You don't want people NOT voting because then your sample becomes biased.

"X show has a 90% like rating. It's probably good. But Y show has a 50% like rating. It's probably not."

>> ARTICLE
Ratings have been and will always be subjective. There's nothing wrong with rating something you enjoyed a 10/10. 
>> ARTICLE
Not if it's a personal, private ranking.

A ranking should serve the purpose of separating what's good and what's bad. But if you're going to dilute the 7+ pool with your shit taste then you've made the rankings a worthless tool for anyone trying to find a new show.

IMDB actually does the rankings decently well. Anything 7+ is consistently (i.e. most of the time) a good movie. But unlike anime, movies are bite sized and IMDB doesn't fucking make you write an essay when you wanna rate a show. You pick a star and that's it. No drop down menus, no rating on its "art/story/characters/sound" or whatever other trait you wanna bog down the rating process with.
>> ARTICLE
Really dont understand why you even use the term shit taste. Thats a term thats overused a lot here, the way your using that term makes me think that youre the kid. The point of ratings is to be subjective to ones taste. You call other people shit taste cause it isnt the same as yours, or cause they dont look at things from a critical view. Just because people rate anime based on their enjoyment doesnt mean that you get to be an ass just cause you like to be a critic about every anime you watch.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody honestly has bad taste, so it sounds like you're being pretty pretentious. And who are you to say what's good and what's bad, we all have different tastes. Doesn't mean they're shit because it's different than yours.

Right. I use MAL a lot when looking for anime to watch and while I don't necessarily agree with all the rankings and stuff, the ratings are *generally* decent measurements for how "good" something is. Of course I have my own opinions that reflect my views (I fucking love complicated borderline pretentious shows that mess with my head, while I can't stand something with a bad plot) but I usually end up rating something within a range of one higher or lower than the most common score (so if something is usually rated an 8, I'll probably give it between a 7-9). I've found that MAL is actually a nice indicator of how the average casual watcher might like a show, and so long as you look at the scores with that mindset everything seems pretty reasonably rated.

It's probably not *the* best anime series ever, but it's definitely a masterpiece, the show and the manga. I have to agree with the other comments: it's a story that almost anyone can enjoy, whether they be a fan of anime/manga or not. It's easily accessible because it's not too...well, "weird". In fact, it was this series that got me back into anime, which I almost always avoided because it scared me (that, and the fans I encountered). And, honestly, it has so many likable characters, both the villains and the heroes, and it's such a huge story! It's...it's not the greatest, but I consider it one of the best out there.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's just really well known.  Whenever I hear someone recommend an anime for someone new to anime, it's almost always full metal brotherhood.  It's got a lot of viewer appeal to newbies

It's not my favorite anime of all time but that is just because of personal preference, it's one of the best anime ever created and it totally deserves to be number one.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty much the only one who still prefers the original.  It has a stronger emotional core and gives the homunculi a much stronger connection to the characters.
>> ARTICLE
But does it have a resolution?
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely, it all came full circle with the film's ending with regard to equivalent exchange.

My problem with Brotherhood, why I don't think it's the best thing ever, and why I believe it's so well liked in general, is because it isn't truly ambitious in that it doesn't push any envelopes, and so it doesn't alienate anyone (except for those of us who don't like *absurdly* happy endings, but clearly /r/anime's demographic enjoys that to a very high degree).

It told a very well known sort of story in a fairly straight way without any real surprises beyond a couple tragedies very early on. Little-to-no moral ambiguity, all the good guys were good guys and the bad guys were all really bad guys, with one token bad-guy-who's-really-just-misled, and in the end the good guys beat the bad guys, the hero gets the girl, peace reigns over the land, and everyone lives happily ever after.
>> ARTICLE
Which film? Shamballa or Milos? Are they worth watching? I think I've read they're quite bland...
>> ARTICLE
Conqueror of Shamballa; it's *literally* the ending to the 2003 version of Fullmetal Alchemist, and without it the series ends too abruptly and without enough resolution. People hate it for seemingly no other reasons besides (1) like most of FMA 2003 it isn't canon with the manga, (2) it isn't anything like Brotherhood's ending in tone, and (3) it involves Nazi Germany which is like a trigger or something for these people. [Spoilers for both series](/s "Ed and Winry having a familial/sibling relationship instead of an out-of-nowhere romantic one probably rubbed a lot of them the wrong way too.") I thought it was the bee's knees though.

Star of Milos was some disconnected Brotherhood movie if I recall correctly, but doesn't really bring anything to the table. I couldn't actually finish that one, there just wasn't any tension to it knowing that it doesn't factor into the overall story at all.
>> ARTICLE
> (1) like most of FMA 2003 it isn't canon with the manga

Although wasn't that at the Manga-ka's request? The anime studio caught up to her, and instead of doing the Bleach/One Piece/Dragon Ball thing where they artificially stretch out the story and/or add filler, she told them to make up their own story from the point they caught up and forward.

It's the easiest for the American audience to get into, and the dub is so good that casuals love it.

It's not the best anime ever, no doubt, but its definitely up there. It's something that's almost universally accepted as brilliant so I feel its OK for it to hold the moniker of 'best anime'.
>> ARTICLE
Quite frankly, no.

Fullmetal Alchemist is one of those anime where I just dont see the appeal. Even some of the more critical people of anime like Thatanimesnob or Digibro think its a great anime.

First of all the story wasnt anything particularly amazing to me. It had interesting concepts and plot points, but as the show went on they quickly became meaningless. For example I liked the idea of that worlds Alchemy and equivalent exchange, but it quickly became obvious that it was just magic with no real rhyme or reason for what is "equivalent", and towards the end of the series all the main alchemy users didnt even need alchemy circles. And even when I tried to get engrossed into the story, the show rips me right out because of its terrible timing in humor. Never has a show seemed like it has actively tried preventing me from enjoying it than Fullmetal Alchemist. Lets take an example like when [FMA:B](/s "Izumi is talking about her dead baby and then all of a sudden it goes into its wacky "LOL RANDUMB" mode.") It wasnt funny, it was just annoying and frustrating because I was actually engaged into Izumi's backstory for a moment there.

The animation wasnt anything special. At the beginning and middle it was just meh, then during the final battles it got pretty amazing.

I cant really say much for the characters because I never got to feel for them. Again, the humor pulled me out of the experience so much. The humor didnt even appeal to me, it was literally just "LOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL ARENT WE SO RANDOM?", there werent clever jokes and any running jokes were just one word insults like "pipsqeuak" and then following that Ed would get mad. *So funny.*
>> ARTICLE
It's amazing how you're being downvoted for answering the question differently than everyone else. This sub never ceases to disappoint me. I'm with you, I've seen 24 episodes and put it on hold, because honestly I got a bit bored with it, and part of that is because of, which you said as well, the awkward humour that pulls me out of the experience (kind of like Hellsing Ultimate, which at least had the benefit of not taking itself very seriously the rest of the time either).
>> ARTICLE
I started FMA brotherhood yesterday. i am very disapointed at the childish humor. i would like the anime otherwise, but the bad humor tropes every 5 minutes in the middle of an otherwise serious moment is preventing me for liking it. i am 10 episodes so far (i had a 14 hours flight thats why) but i doubt i will reach 51. 
>> ARTICLE
This is a pretty good summary of why I dislike FMA:B. Mind if I simply use this as a copy paste?
>> ARTICLE
Sure, go ahead.
>> ARTICLE
(Copypaste of my reply to u/Radiobandit):
Most people agree the humor is the weakest part of the show. Whether on not you can overlook that depends on how invested you are into the rest of the show. If you can ignore it and get invested in the rest of the show, it improves on itself over time exponentially. If you can't, I don't think you'll get anything out of it.
>> ARTICLE
Its really hard to get invested in a show that is constantly taking you out of the experience, I just cant do that.
>> ARTICLE
I think the original FMA did better in that regard, no LOLFUNNY chibi scenes and a noticeably darker tone overall. I think the best way to enjoy the franchise would be to watch FMA up until whatever point it diverged enough from the manga then continue at that point from FMA:B. Then finish up FMA because it's still pretty good. 
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people had FMA as one of the first anime they watched. As it is fairly accessible to new audiences people tend to look back on it fondly, as is typical of entry level shows. 

Also shounens are typically higher rated than other shows as they have more episodes. Since their is an episode limit threshold for scores to count, many people who hate a show their votes don't count

But if you're asking if people can dislike it. Yes, for example I dislike it. 
I won't even go into how childish Ed's "humor" scenes are, or by extension how insufferable I found him. 

For one to me it was extremely tedious, the arcs took forever and I didn't feel like anything interesting was happening in many of the episodes, basically it was boring too often. 

Scar was fun though, best character in the show. 

>> ARTICLE
I have something semi-relevant to share...

I tried to introduce my parents to anime for a long time. I started on FMA:B because wide appeal, crisp animation, quick pacing, yada yada. My parents didn't really like it though. We watched up to about episode 40 because they were doing it for me but I could tell they weren't into it so we stopped.

Fast forward a little while, I found a new anime that I really liked called Hunter X Hunter, which got so good at one point that I just couldn't stop talking about it. So, I got my parents to watch that one and they loved it.

I asked my mom why she didn't like FMA:B and she echoed back to me pretty much the only gripe I have with it... the characters are bland. I think this is a problem that plagues most anime. My mom is a writer and English professor, reader of literature, etc. FMA:B's characters and plot are solid but simple. It's very much a child's anime. HxH, on the other hand, has complex characters and plot twists that are far more engaging than anything in FMA:B.

So, there are people who don't think FMA:B is the best anime ever. I personally rated them both a 10 but I have to admit that seeing HxH made FMA:B pale a bit in comparison. That is to say, it opened my eyes to its weaknesses. FMA:B has a more cohesive plot overall, an unwavering pace and a very strong resolution. But HxH at its best is a sight to behold.

^^^^FMA ^^^^was ^^^^better

It is *one of* the best anime, but it's also easily accessible for basically anyone. It serves as an introductory anime for newbies, myself included.

I honestly couldn't make it past the second episode. The cringy, overwhelming humor mixed with 2-dimensional interactions between all the characters was a complete turn-off. I thought at first it was just the typical nostalgia-boosted hype that most anime's aimed at a younger audience receive but it seems that even older audiences applaud the series. Maybe I'm missing out on something glorious here but I just don't understand why FMA is so highly rated.
>> ARTICLE
Try watching the original FMA. Brotherhood shafts the beginning because the original existed and the original has overall less humour as well.

i wanted to watch brotherhood because its more recent and would have better graphics, but after 10 episodes, i think i will either drop it or try the original FMA. i cant stand the cringy humor moments they push every 5 minutes just after someone died.

Overall yes I think it might be the best Anime of all time IMO.

Ofc there are a lot of different series that have different advantages over FMA but I don't think there are any that can beat FMA in more than 6/10 categories. For example FMA has really really good animation but Attack on Titans is slightly better. However AoT is generally considered inferior to FMA in basically every other category.


I think there are a lot of older Anime that could be right up there with FMA due to plot but they suffer from terrible voice acting or animation. A lot of people ofc are willing to overlook terrible animation and VA for good plot but for overall mainstream appeal quality animation and VA is a must.
>> ARTICLE
Best anime series ever? No. Best shounen? Propably. And since shounen is the most popular anime genre, and shounen fans tend not to be critical when it comes to ratings, it makes sense that fullmetal alchemist is always at the top of the lists. 

What truly makes it good though, is that it appeals to a wider audience than other anime of its genre. I don't know if it deserves the top spot in the lists, but i'm happy with it being at there, because i think it is the safest choice to recommend to someone new to anime, or someone just looking for a good show, and imo that's how rated anime lists should be used.
>> ARTICLE
But HxH is the best shounen, you're wrong.
>> ARTICLE
While your statement should be taken as opinion based and not  "FACT", I watched brotherhood and then watched HXH 2011 directly after and can say, there were times when Brotherhood may have been better than HXH but HXH and that damn chimera ant arc.... that solidified it over brotherhood for me. It made me feel feelings never before felt for a tv show. 
>> ARTICLE
HxH is not for simple mind like you, and you cannot see the true value of HxH at the first watch. FMA:B for me is just a super casual shounen, with some good storyline, no where near HxH.
>> ARTICLE
you're a retard. I said HxH was better
>> ARTICLE
Well it's definitely NOT the best anime ever created. There are so many anime that are better imo (HxH 2011 is one of them) but it's still my favorite anime of all time :D. It's kinda weird but it appeals to the viewer that much, everything is perfect you get the feels you root for the brothers it makes me feel different inside when I watch fmab also it doesn't matter what age you are, it's still nice to watch as an 40 year old where as K-on would be weird to watch as a 40 year old 
>> ARTICLE
Best shounen maybe. 
>> ARTICLE
This is really quite a silly question. FMA:B is where it is because it has quite a bit of popular appeal to what happens to be a very large demographic in the anime community. The idea of calling it, or anything else, the "undoubtedly best series ever created," simply on the basis of it being a lot of people's favourite series, is silly. 

If it's your personal favourite, then that's totally cool and you should own that opinion. But there will always be people who have seen Brotherhood who a) like something else better, b) enjoyed it but didn't necessarily love it, and c) straight-up didn't like it. And none of those people have the wrong opinion (any more than the people who adored Brotherhood above all else have the "right" opinion).

My recommendation: instead of worrying about whether or not your favourite series can lay claim to a status as "the best" series ever made, maybe devote some time and energy to really understanding *why* Brotherhood is your favourite, and what elements there are in that particular series that speak to you in a way no other show thus far has. You might learn a couple things about yourself that you didn't know before in the process. :)
>> ARTICLE
First of all, FMAB is not my favourite anime, I'm simply posing a question based on facts. Second, what other tool do we have in the anime world to know which series are the best? We don't have Academy Awards or Roger Ebert, we don't have Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes, we don't have Sight and Sound or They Shoot Pictures Don't They, we don't have Rolling Stones or Time Magazine lists, we only have those rankings and personal lists written by bloggers. So I think these ratings should be taken into consideration when we try to make a selection of "best anime series ever" because they serve as a filter selection for the thousands and thousands of anime works created.
>> ARTICLE
IMO, the flaw in this approach is that the very idea of "trying to make a selection of best anime series ever" is ridiculous - and becomes fundamentally flawed when you try to take *anything* into account other than your own personal opinion of those series.

How good a series is or isn't is an incredibly personal thing. What shows you or I consider to be the best out there is - invariably - reflective of our individual understandings of the world around us, our emotional centres, life experiences, and what we seek when we consume our media. It's something that merits discussion, certainly - but trying to use that discussion to create a concrete "these are the best anime ever created" list, while not impossible, is ultimately meaningless.

Not that there's no merit in lists existing at all! As you pointed out, it's a useful starting point for a viewer to filter their selection. But (and this was my experience, when I started really getting into anime) when trying to use other people's preferences as a filter, *context is everything.* I've had much better results finding individuals/critics/etc. whose preferences I understand (and are usually similar to mine to some degree and in some fashion), and looking at what *they* recommend, than I have looking at something like MAL (which at this point I basically just avoid like the plague) or any other generic "best anime ever" list. Those amalgamated lists indicate *popularity,* which certainly says SOMETHING about a series (and it's something that shouldn't be dismissed or ignored) - but it doesn't do much to say how "good" a series will be for me.

Back once more, still trying to keep up best I can but don't be surprised If I suddenly stop commenting. 

**Episode 9**

* The sound of that bitch slap was so satisfying. Ed gets his wake up call then.
* Ah nice reincorporation of the after credits scene
* Woo! Winry joins the team!
* That group stare down, Ed has certainly learned his place
* Couldn't they just solve Al's concerns about his humanity by showing him a picture of himself when he still had a human body? It's not actually like there is a State Photoshop Alchemist. Or is the problem that he thinks he is just a clone?
* Birthday party scene was great, Papa Hughes pulled a pistol in front of the kids
* If his daughter dies I quit this show
* Well this episode just got deep
* Winry helplessly hitting Al with the wrench ;_; *SHE'S SUCH A GOOD CHARACTER*
* Scar hard 2: Scar Harder

**Episode 10**

* Starting to see more into this civil war. After Mustang and the Fuhrer had a stare down I'm definitely of the opinion that he is actually evil. I mean we have yet to see the real reasons behind *why* they are systematically slaughtering the Scar people. We saw last thread that Scar was being hunted down by the Sin folk and I theorized that it was because he was actually a good guy and was interrupting their plans. With this in mind perhaps the fuhrer is also in cahoots with the Sins and was actually killing the Scar people for the same reason they are. I mean that would be a plausible reason as to why this war keeps getting brought back up and why every time it is the State side always looks like the oppressors. 
*  Fuhrer certainly does have a split personality, he also seems more than just curious as to what the MC is up to. ***I HAVE MY EYES ON YOU MR.***
* Screw him deciding you are trustworthy MC, you should be questioning whether HE is trustworthy
* Holy shit what if the Fuhrer is the 'Father' we have been hearing about. I mean all you have to do is swap out a few letters- trust me this is compelling evidence! But seriously it could explain how Lust and Gluttony were able to track down Scar if they used his information network that he just mentioned. It could also link to the war and how their goals seem to align. Here's how it works; The fuhrer, otherwise know as the 'Father' to the deadly sins devises a plan to destroy the world or whatever evil reasons he needs. He needs Alchemists to carry out his plan so he creates an organisation of state alchemists to basically unify then all together under his control for when the time comes. At some point he realizes that the Scar people can stop his plan. Maybe it's because they are like Scar and are anti-alchemy or something- I distinctly remember Scar or someone mentioning that he only uses the first two of three stages to alchemy (so perhaps the third stage is what is important to 'Fathers' plan). Given this information the Fuhrer manufactures a reason to invade and kill the Scar people so that he could go unopposed without the average joe catching onto his plans. It makes perfect sense holy shit. Seriously the Fuhrer would be the perfect person to be able to pull something like this together given his power over the state.
*  Going back to episode 1? I think...we see the Fuhrer getting SUPER pissed at the guy who was rampaging through the city. That was because he was intentionally or not killing off his alchemists which he needed. He wasn't just pissed because he was a bad-ass (although he still is) but because the guy was pushing back his plans. In the previous threads we saw the samurai brothers get killed off by the sins before they could tell Ed about the sacrificial circle. Maybe, JUST MAYBE, the fuhrer plans to gather all the state alchemists (including full metal) into a room, use the sacrificial circle thing, then create the biggest most fuck-off sized Philosophers stone, then use its power to destroy a now defenseless empire (no alchemists left, no scar people). If so this dude is a genius on so many levels. It would also make for a cool storyline where Mustang and Full metal lead a revolutionary army against the now openly evil Fuhrer. **OMG I HAVE TO BE RIGHT GUYS PLEASE THIS IS TOO GOOD**
* *ahem* back to the episode now...I'll put my tinfoil hat away
* YES Winry has an excuse to tag along!
* Dude in the trench coat on the train looks suspicious...and conveniently sat behind MC...sorry I was supposed to put my tinfoil hat away
* With Ed+Al crying about how tough their master is I'm almost betting on the master and Winry getting along like best friends
* WHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT Hughes is onto to what I was thinking *we are so in touch*
* NO HUGHES NO NO NO NO NO NO 
* RUN
* RUN FOR YOUR DAUGHTER
* RUN FOR YOUR WIFE
* RUN FOR YOUR LIFE
* YES TALK TO MUSTANG NOT THE FUHRER
* HOLY SHHHHH THE REDSHIRTS ARE ACTUALLY EVILSHIRTS?!?!?
* OMG NO THAT IS ACTUALLY ENVY! BASED HUGHES IS SO SMART
* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ;_;
* SHES GONNA GROW UP WITHOUT A DADDY ;_;
* Fuck..I hate this show
* Is it raining in my room? I think it might be...
* 'General Hughes' 
* "Looks like it is begining to rain" *"No I don't think so"* "No it's raining alright" **That might just be one of the best scenes in an anime ever** 


*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO* I'm so glad I started watching this series, episode 10 especially, There is so much to dissect from what the show tells you and man if Hughes death didn't take something out of me...

So hyped for future episodes! I'm rooting for Scar to 1v2 Lust and Gluttony and kick their asses back to hell! I WANT TO SEE THESE EVIL SONS-OF-FATHER TO DIE! Also Mustang needs to be the one to kill the Fuhrer!

I knew something had to be up when Hughes and his family starting getting the spotlight all the time but I'll admit I wasn't expecting it to play out the way it did. It was handled fantastically however, so respect to the creators!
>> ARTICLE
Regarding what Scar said about alchemy, there are 3 parts of alchemy, comprehension, destruction and creation. When you see for example ed use alchemy, he first finds out what material he is about to transform, then he destroys that material and finally he creates something new from that material.

Scar however only uses the first 2 parts, comprehension and destruction.

Btw, I really enjoy watching your theories about what is happening. You're certainly better at making them than I was when I was watching it for the first time. I'll agree with /u/Slackwork, it's even better than you think.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for expanding on the Alchemy thing with Scar. I knew he said something like that but I couldn't remember precisely. 

It seems to me that if the Fuhrer or Sins are wanting to sacrifice humans to create an uber powered Philosophers stone then that would certainly be a violation of the 'creation' part of the Alchemy process which Scar is against. Makes sense. Should be good to see Scars story unfold in future episodes. 

Btw the trick to writing good theories is to just guess 50 things at a time like I do :D

I too have failed, this is my second time watching FMA:B. I'm up to episode 41 and I don't see myself stopping my pace anytime soon
>> ARTICLE
Episode 50, started two days ago. Second time watching.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say about 70% of first time watchers have failed. But at least they will watch it. :P
>> ARTICLE
I'm holding true still. Also I have to say, I didn't expect that scene from the famous gif to happen so soon.
>> ARTICLE
26 here, i had watched the original but thats it
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit episode 26, I remember that ending scene, can't wait to reactions when we finally reach that episode
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't recall the episode so I looked up the summary.  Oof, goosebumps from a summary, I must be getting soft.
>> ARTICLE
I'm definitely with Hughes, :D Ed and Winrey are already bickering like an old married cou- oh... shit. :(  
Where'd I put my umbrella?

On a side note, looks like all the FMA:B spoilers I knew happen pretty early, so that's a pleasant surprise. 
>> ARTICLE
Good, only a REAL asshole would spoil stuff that happens later on. Such a good show.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I'm an asshole because I sorta "accidentally" spoiled something pretty big for myself a little while after I posted my comment but goddammit, I ain't even mad! :D :D
>> ARTICLE
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Don't worry theres lots, so hopefully nothing to crazy, feel free to respond in spoiler tags about what it was.
>> ARTICLE
It was [last episode I think, for other nosey peeps](/s " "I'll give you half of my life if you give me half of yours" "). And you don't need such a big reaction. :p I took it the same as if I hadn't seen the scene until it actually happened. Besides, happy spoilers = good spoilers in my book!

[Hmm... XD](/s "I guess *that's* why it has so many upvotes")
>> ARTICLE
ohhh yeah, your all good. Thats like nothing to worry about, you'll understand my reaction once you get to the later stuff. It is amazing and crazy and awesome, goddamn this show was/is so satisfying to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I'm *super* hyped now. 
>> ARTICLE
Finally, I was looking forward to this thread

[It's a rainy day today](http://i.imgur.com/SCq9lCX.jpg)

Finally the 2003 show and this version begin to fully separate, while not completely until late episode 14 since the 2003 version grabs parts of the manga as an inspiration for some episodes while changing more stuff so the pacing is still a little fast for the next few episodes
>> ARTICLE
I almost break down on the Hughes funeral, if I'm almost breaking down 10 episodes in I don't know how I will handle the rest of the anime.

Both episodes are great. I'm gonna miss Hughes, a lot.
>> ARTICLE
When his daughter starts yelling about "why are they putting dirt on daddy", I almost lose it every time. It ain't raining in my house today!!
>> ARTICLE
So I wonder why they put [these two](https://imgur.com/Nv03D4Z) into episode 9
>> ARTICLE
IIRC they were in the manga, it also kinda shows they have a life outside of what happens during the show
>> ARTICLE
They were in the manga in that scene.

FMA was fully planned out from start to end when it was being drawn, as such there is some cool foreshadowing and early-bird cameo's that go on.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I know, IIRC Arakawa told studio Bones how the story continues when they were doing the original anime so that way they could make a completely different story
>> ARTICLE
[F](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/FMA_rain_6856.jpg)

Goddamnit. That's not fair. He literally was too much of a good guy. The juxtaposition of his funeral with Ed, Al and Winry talking about him and his family was just rubbing salt in the wound.
>> ARTICLE
aw man...Hughes was one of my favorite characters ;----; I'm really getting hooked now.  It's getting reallllly good. 

I'm just speculating but I'm guessing the Fuhrer-President organized the Ishbalan exterminations to create an ultra-powerful philosophers stone. 
>> ARTICLE
Loved the scene with Bradley sneaking into Eds hospital room.

[Later spoilers, DONT READ if you haven't seen the show](/s "Bradleys entire speech too Ed, Armstrong and Hughes is a lot more interesting when you know his motives. Makes me wonder who hes really talking about when he mentions how far the enemy has infiltrated and how they're one step ahead etc...")
>> ARTICLE
I am not sure if I can watch only 2 episodes a day after episode 9+10....
>> ARTICLE
I never felt so sad about any other character than Alphonse, he can't do anything, but trust his brother that he truly exists and is hopefully gonna get his body back. 

Also, I don't know why, but Hughes' death got me harder this time than the first time I saw it. He was such a good guy too, always looking out for the Elric brothers.
>> ARTICLE
I always want to give Al a hug ten times as big as he is when he's acting sad. :'( 
>> ARTICLE
Hughes :(.. It's raining here too :( :(
>> ARTICLE
So, uh guys, around which episode shall we start watching 3 episodes a day?
>> ARTICLE
I think sticking to the plan of increasing the count at ep 15 should be fine
>> ARTICLE
So I increase it by 1 episode again in 3 days?
>> ARTICLE
Either that or at the very least make episode 27 skippable since there's not much discussion for that one

EDIT: alternatively make episode 20 and 40 the episodes where the episode count increases
>> ARTICLE
I would make 3 the cap otherwise I will be left behind ;_:

>> ARTICLE
So if I make 3 episodes a day, will you be able to follow? A lot of people are already watching 20 episodes a day 
>> ARTICLE
With 3 episodes a day it would be tough and I will probably have to play catch-up in a few threads but if you started doing 4 episodes a day I probably wouldn't be able to join in anymore. 

Edit: So that is a yes, if I wasn't too clear.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I am in a difficult situation, didn't expect this to happen. People have lost patience and there are people that can't keep up. :( Though around episode 30 I will make them 3 episodes per day. No more I promise. But the last day will probably be 5 days because nothing else will be after that. :P Seems fair doesn't it? I am sure that after episode 26, you won't be able to stop watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Well I appreciate that many people want to keep watching beyond the pace of the threads, as is their right but I suppose at the end of the day these are discussion threads and having too many episodes crammed into one thread would kind of defeat the purpose of it. People who have watched ahead can always discuss previous episodes but those left behind can't discuss the latest ones.
>> ARTICLE
As somebody who watched Brotherhood I agree that 3 episodes should be the cap, even with not as many good anime this season (at least IMO) 4 episodes already require more than one hour to watch all episodes and I really enjoy seeing first timers posts, specially since /u/rascorpia has tons of fun conspiracies and reactions to read
>> ARTICLE
Same here, I'm a first time watcher and can barely keep up with 2 episodes a day. Working 40 hrs a week and watching 10 other anime doesn't help either.
>> ARTICLE
As a first time watcher who has seen the original FMA, I'm really happy to see this picking up. I was a little nervous about the first few episodes because they felt rushed and underdeveloped but both of these were perfect. If the series keeps ramping up the tension at this level of craft I'm excited to see where this goes. On a side note: I'm really starting to like the soundtrack of this series.
>> ARTICLE
The soundtrack is great, but there are really only 3-4 different themes, and everything else is different orchestrations/arrangements of said themes. Also there's no Bratja :(
>> ARTICLE
They felt rushed because they wrote Brotherhood with the assumption that peeps have already seen the 2003 series.
>> ARTICLE
That makes sense. The only problem is that now it's harder to resist watching ahead.
>> ARTICLE
I can't participate in rewatches haha. I'm too impatient, I have to marathon everything

I can't participate in rewatches haha. I'm too impatient, I have to marathon everything

Dang it! haha I had no idea this was going on. I bought the whole manga collection about a month ago. And am on volume 11 right now. I will have to start re-watching the anime too. I cant get enough so this sounds fun. Just need to catch up now.
>> ARTICLE
 As someone who has just finished watching the original series and hasn't seen Brotherhood yet, the minor differences are pretty interesting to see.

Hughes's death this time seemed a little less sad since you don't see as much of him in Brotherhood as you did in the original. Still fucking sad though. 
>> ARTICLE
At least Hughes' death has bigger consequences in this show than in the 2003 version
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know the name of the song playing while Ed was on the phone with Winry?
>> ARTICLE
I had watched the original and now I'm making my way through Brotherhood. I'm currently on episode 20. I'm trying to finish before it's taken off Netflix.
>> ARTICLE
I skipped to episode 20 while watching Brotherhood. I figured since I watched the couple episodes of the original, I'd be fine skipping right into the story.

 
Edit: I said while watching Brotherhood. Not watching it right now, finished the series two years ago.
>> ARTICLE
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand now you're completely lost since episode 11 is where both show begin to separate
>> ARTICLE
It don't matter! I know how it ends! 
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood has a very different ending from the original though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Im totally aware of that... I finished Brotherhood twice already. 
>> ARTICLE
I think he probably has spoiled himself.
>> ARTICLE
Is Roy really a womanizer though? ;)
>> ARTICLE
I agree with it being a facade.  

In the manga (I believe) after learning about Dr Marco's cook book they explain that alchemists hide their alchemy notes. Then their was like a side-track panel where they explain Ed's notes are in the form of a travel log (that Alphonse can't read) and Roy hides his in the form of a date appointment book.

As much as they joke about him being a womanizer the only woman he pays attention to is Hawkeye. 
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't act the part much during either show's plot, but he definitely has a reputation for it that he frequently uses to fly under the radar.
>> ARTICLE
In the early days of the manga he definitely was. It carried over into the original series a bit too. In the episode where Roy and Ed fight, one of the officers yells, "Give me back my girlfriend!" when Roy is introduced.
>> ARTICLE
He kinda plays/pretends to be one. Though I'm sure he never got farther than first base knowing Hawkeye, pretty sure there is more to her name than her marksmanship. 
>> ARTICLE
And I'm sure he's scared of both.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, he wasn't. He did put up the facade to hide from the upper reaches of the military.
>> ARTICLE
Plus, he uses it to tease Hawkeye a lot.
>> ARTICLE
He makes fun because he doesn't know how to say he likes her.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I'm fairly certain they were well aware of their feelings for each other.

In fact I got the vibe more than once that they were totally already an item but obviously couldn't be public about it because that would be fraternization and they would no longer be able to work together. 

In fact, in the Manga Artbook 3, in response to answering a fan questioning about why hasn't Mustang married Hawkeye at the end of the series, Arakawa stated "I can't get them to marry because of Military Regulations. If they got married, they could no longer stay as superior officer and subordinate".

Long story short....they were totally an item but the military regulations requires they hide it.
>> ARTICLE
That's always the way I looked at it too. He's like a middle schooler in that way. So is Hawkeye, in a sense. Neither of them really are adults about it.

And if I remember correctly, both Hawkeye and Mustang have ruined their own moments a few times. One of them will start to say something sweet, and the other will ruin it.
>> ARTICLE
Really? As a huge Royai shipper, I've always seen their relationship as very mature. I personally think they both know about their feelings for each other, but can't say it out loud (or marry, for that matter), because of [FMA and FMA Brotherhood](/s "Roy's goal"), and them being in the military.

For example, if their feelings were common knowledge, the higher-ups who hate Roy for [FMA and FMA Brotherhood](/s "his ambition") would use her against him... [FMA Brotherhood](/s "well, that actually happened, but it would have happened a lot earlier, and a lot more often.")

But now that [FMA Brotherhood](/s "Grummann, the Shipper On Deck is Fhrer, the military issue probably won't bother them. But they'd probably want to wait until Roy becomes president anyway.")
>> ARTICLE
That's a pretty interesting way of looking at it. Personally, I always saw the military in FMA and FMA Brotherhood as being surprisingly relaxed regarding the personal relationships of its members. A lot of them are very close, goofing off despite being in *very* important positions. I think they both were more than capable of keeping it out of the workplace, but a lot of their interactions just seem to portray them as two people who aren't yet comfortable with telling each other their feelings bluntly.

They're both very mature, I agree. But even the most mature people can resort to the same behaviors that less mature people do, for the right reasons. I think the emotional and professional risks both kept them too nervous to actually allow themselves to give in.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, the anti-fraternization rule is canon. Arakawa said it in one of her artbooks. She even said that's the only reason why she didn't marry them, so Royai is canon too, if that wasn't obvious enough already ;)

I don't think they told each other their feelings, or are in a secret relationship or anything (that would be dumb), but I don't think they *need* to say it. And not because they're really nervous about it, at least I don't believe that's the main reason. It's more about Riza's loyalty as a subordinate, and her fear of becoming a burden to him. Likewise, Roy doesn't want to see her kidnapped because of his position. That why I see them waiting for Roy to become Fhrer to marry.
>> ARTICLE
Does that apply to the anime though? Is it canon for both the anime and manga, or just the manga? I mean either way that's pretty cool!

Do you think that perhaps they realized their feelings (or each other's feelings) later on in the series? Because they seemed to have a lot more suspiciously sensitive moments as the series progressed.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, don't see why it wouldn't apply to the anime. Amestris army is still Amestris army no matter the canon. However the people that made the anime probably didn't kow about it, so I'm not sure. It doesn't really matter anyway.

No, I personally think they realised their feelings early on, maybe during the war, maybe a bit later. Probably was progressive anyway. At least Riza probably knew it by the time they went to the Elric's house, as she told Winry the reason she is in the military is to protect Roy. I blame their increasing involvement with the main plot for the rise in ship-tease moments. Also the fact that they literally went through hell together.
>> ARTICLE
This is also true, though I've read so much RizaxRoy fan fiction I don't know what is cannon anymore. 
>> ARTICLE
[This is cannon for Roy.](http://i.imgur.com/UetoOyQ.png)
>> ARTICLE
It's been so long since I watch either series or read the manga, so I might be getting things mixed up, but I think I remember that it's at least implied that he goes on a lot of dates.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I'd put it past him to do that as a smokescreen.
>> ARTICLE
He went on lots of dates for two main reasons:

A: to conceal his ambitions to be furher. Other officers in the military would dismiss him as a "threat" because they see his goofy, womanizing persona and don't expect him to amount to much.

B: after being scrutinized by the Amestris Military, to communicate Discreetly. Several times over the course of the series he'd go on a date with a woman and slip her a letter to pass on to whoever he needed to contact. On top of that, several times he'd have a conversation with someone (Typically Hawkeye) over the phone in "code" by disguising the conversation as flirting. Agreeing to meet somebody someplace for a "date", delivering "Flowers" to x address, ect.
>> ARTICLE
The "bar", he frequents was a a hot spot to exchange info. Even when he when out alone to hook up, he was working.
>> ARTICLE
> Is Roy really a womanizer though? ;)

I guess if you *really* wanted to, you could argue that love is similar to a burning passion, a heated feeling, or a hot emotion; in other words, she was consumed by the very flames that drove her.

Hiromu Arakawa is a genius mangaka, FMA: Brotherhood is a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Silver Spoon... enough said!
>> ARTICLE
I am kinda split between which version of FMA I like the best. I liked certain aspects of the first FMA anime series but there were definitely also aspects of FMA brotherhood that were done better. For example, I highly enjoyed how homunculi were created in the first FMA. 
>> ARTICLE
Well it should be known that Arakawa's work (the manga) is experienced through Brotherhood, not the original series (considering how it diverges from the manga very early on), though you're probably already aware of that. 
>> ARTICLE
If I were to rate mangakas based on the series I've seen thus far, I'd put her in the top 4. In no particular order:

Eiichiro Oda (One Piece)

Hideaki Sorachi (Gintama)

Yoshihiro Togashi  (Hunter x Hunter) (I'm evaluating writing level, not work ethic :P)

Hiromu Arakawa (Fullmetal Alchemist)

And she's definitely my favorite female mangaka.

Obviously there's many other incredible mangaka, but these are the 4 I find truly elite, who I believe truly master their craft. And if anyone is about to bring up Berserk, sorry I haven't read it :P (I'd read it in a heartbeat if the manga's release schedule was reliable). 
>> ARTICLE
And now put Vagabond everything else. There is so much Wooooooooooow in the manga it is mind blowing. 
>> ARTICLE
You should look into Berserk. It's absolutely crazy how good Miura's art is on every panel. 
>> ARTICLE
Not just the art. The story-telling, character development and world building is also phenomenal. Berserk is an incredible read and worth every bit of time invested into it.
>> ARTICLE
As far as female mangaka go, I think Takahashi Rumiko belongs on that list as well.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing the rest of these are masterpieces too, more anime for me to watch then! :) Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
The 3 others are quite long (HxH being 150 episodes, Gintama being 265 with a new season coming, and One Piece being 680+ with no sign of ending soon), but they are all REALLY great. Gintama is my favorite anime ever, and HxH and One Piece are far up the list.

Also, if you watch HxH, make SURE you watch the Hunter x Hunter (2011) version, NOT the 1999 version. Not that the 1999 version is bad, but the 2011 version is obviously more recent, and is beautifully adapted by Madhouse and goes much deeper into the story. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the info!
>> ARTICLE
No problem, enjoy! :)
>> ARTICLE
Im thinking of getting into Gintama. Is there character development/ overarching stories? Should I start from the beginning? Is it mostly funny or serious at times?
>> ARTICLE
I'll be more than happy to answer any questions you ever have about Gintama, so here we go:

The character development is quite superb, if slow. It's much more different though, because the character feel way more multi-dimensional than most anime. What I mean by that is that they feel like real humans. You will see them act stupid, you will see them be hilarious, you will see them feel depressed and sad, you will see them be overcome by rage, and anything in between. They are fully fleshed out. The characters in Gintama are, in my opinion, the best characters in anime. My 3 favorite characters in all of anime are all from Gintama. If you enjoy well-done characters, Gintama is an anime you should really consider.

That being said, the anime is, for the most part, a comedy. As in, you will not see any serious development or progression. You will see the characters being hilarious while getting an emotional story here and there. 

However, there is an overarching story. Many characters get introduced over the course of the story through their own introduction arcs. There is a main villain and a story behind Gintama. This ''main story'' progresses through what is known as ''serious arcs''. These arcs are usually 4-8 episodes in length in which legitimately serious developments happen, villains get introduced, amazing fights occur, and everything else you'd want from a ''serious'' arc. Overall, I'd say Gintama is about 85% comedy, 15% serious.

You should definitely start from the beginning. As most people claim, the beginning is definitely not the best part of the series, but for good reason. You need to watch a few episodes to grow attached to the characters and realize how incredible they are. Once you reach about episode 25 it really kicks into gear and everything gets good from there. Also, it just gets better, and better, and better as the series goes on and as you get into serious arcs.

And yeah, as I would describe it, Gintama is "mostly funny, but serious at times" and when its serious, it's really serious (although there will always be jokes snuck in here and there). 

Note: There's a new season starting in April, so if you want to get into Gintama, now is the best time :)

edit: Sorry if you didn't want to read all that here's a **TL;DR** for your questions:

1- There is character development (the characters are the best !) and an over-arching story (although ~80% of the show is episodic)

2- You should start from the beginning to get to know all the characters (the show starts getting REALLY good ~episode 25 and gets better as the series goes on)

3- It's mostly funny but serious at times (serious arcs are the best!)
>> ARTICLE
Hey, great response I appreciate the writeup

I was mostly worried that it would be a lot to watch without much payoff (getting attached to the characters) and more of a show for casual watching. Sounds like it does both quite well, I will give it a shot thanks!
>> ARTICLE
The first 2 episodes are back story and most people would encourage you to start on ep 3.
>> ARTICLE
9 and a half days it would take to watch ALL Current One Piece Episodes (based on each one being 20 minutes)

And it's still amazing.

I honestly have no idea when it's going to end or if it'll ever end.  

Sunday mornings are amazing.
>> ARTICLE
It took me a solid week off work to catch up with the manga.  That was when the current chapter was like 410.  It's closing in on 800 now.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed :)

It really, REALLY makes the best use possible of its absolutely enormous length. I don't think anything else can be so enjoyable for such a long period of time, and how it ties everything together so well is just something else. 

When it ends, it will be such a sad day, but at the same time I'm sure the ending will be absolutely incredible. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait for Gintama to come back. Funniest anime IMO. That show had me in tears laughing. This is one of my favorite episodes....

While she is definitely one of my favorites.... I have to give my favorite spot to Rumiko Takahashi.... she wrote way too many gold series.

>> ARTICLE
I may be guilty of judging mangaka based solely on their greatest work (or at least my favorite of their work) :P
>> ARTICLE
That's a great list! On top of Urasawa and Inoue I would also recommend you look into Hayao Miyazaki. Yes *the* Miyazaki. His manga version of Nausicaa Valley of Wind is one of the best work of manga I have ever read. Whilst it's not a lengthy tome, the characters, the moral ambiguity, and the ideas contained in this manga is top notch. The art is gorgeous, and the expressions on characters speaks louder than words. For me it is one of the greatest fictional work I have ever read.
>> ARTICLE
He has made more manga, unfortunately none but Naussica has been translated and released. I crave the manga version of The Wind Rises. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved the manga of Nausicaa, but it does make the film much worse (for me at least) simply due to how much better the story is in the manga :(
>> ARTICLE
For sure! I still have the Nausicaa collector's set in my room somewhere... and have a copy of the 7 volumes on my ipad for the occassional read. 

And yes... the anime....... just couldnt fit so much as a movie, truly the series should have been a series rather than movie. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest with you, I was not aware he dabbled in writing manga. Thanks for the recommendation :)

>> ARTICLE
It was not very well known when I found out. I felt like a manga hipsters. But hunting down copies of the translated manga was very expensive at the time, and it was *tiny*.

Now? Viz has lovingly re-done the manga in a lovingly well done Hardcover box set, and surprisingly the whole boxset cost only $41! It is the best bargain imo in terms of enjoyment per $! You have found the perfect time to read this masterpiece.

You should read some older/sienen manga, there's a reason Naoki Urasawa, and Takehiko Inoue are Japanese national treasures.

Those guys/girls are great, but other than having very good/entertaining series, I don't think they are really pushing the craft, or have a true mastery of conveying information through comic format. 
>> ARTICLE
I've loved Monster (Naoki Urasawa) so far, but it's so tough to get my hands on. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm not really rating based on their innovativeness, because if I were then none of these would probably make the cut considering how they mostly mastered an already defined style rather than inventing or attempting to define a new one. However, I do truly feel as though their writing is close to perfection in itself, while perhaps not being "ahead of their time" or something like that. So I agree with your first point in that they may not be pushing the craft, however I'd disagree on your second point, I do truly believe they have mastered what they do. 

I am a big shounen fan though (while I do still love seinen). 

And I really should get into Slam Dunk and Monster at some point! Thanks for reminding me. 


>> ARTICLE
I think they're all great mangakas, with enjoyable stories, unique art, and fantastic frame composition. I just don't think their work gains anything from the manga format, as evident by the fact that they all have adaptions of around equal quality (minus One Piece). On the other hand, trying to adapt an Inoue manga would be a sin, because it requires the manga format. So while I think those guys/girls are great storytellers, and artists, I don't really think of them as amazing mangakas, but I'm probably over thinking it.
>> ARTICLE
That's a very arbitrary argument to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I think that's more related to how you define the skill of a mangaka. Personally, it's mostly just based on the quality of the story itself, excluding whether or not it can be replicated through another medium (like an anime). I don't mind what exactly they do with the paper itself, I just really focus on the quality of the storytelling and writing, and all the elements that are encompassed by it. 

 I can see and respect your own definition of what makes a mangaka truly "great", but I think that's just a matter of difference of opinion, and what you value as important when reading a manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Slam Dunk is definitely great. It was the sport's manga that convinced me that the sports genre for anime and manga is not as bad as I thought it would be.

And I hear a lot of good things from Monster so I might read/ watch it at some point.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the market for some good new manga. I just finished Berserk, then Shigurui, so violent stuff. Suggestions?

EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions, y'all. My cup runneth over.
>> ARTICLE
Not entirely violent(though it does have a lot of brutal scenes), but Oyasumi PunPun. #6 on MAL and one of the best manga I have read, up there with the likes of Berserk.
>> ARTICLE
Holy Land. It also had a Drama, which I never watched and no little about, but the manga is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Bastard

Rainbow
>> ARTICLE
GUNNM/Battle Angel Alita, and the sequel, Last Order. (starts out slowish though, becomes more scifi-y and more fighty later.
>> ARTICLE
This is more or less the perfect reccomendation for Berserk fans IMO.

Just a question,I loved the ending of the original Alita,should I read Last Order or will it ruin it?
>> ARTICLE
Uhh, yes because its very interesting and expands more on the universe. It becomes very fighty though, and they explain a bit of events and wander into very deep character questioning
>> ARTICLE
Wait wtf is Berserk done? Last I checked Skeleton Dude fucked up so hard unicorns became real. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not done. Nowhere near done. I'm sure he means he caught up with the latest chapter.

Check out Gantz. It's not entirely new but it is a masterpiece. Similar theme to berserk, tragedy, supernatural, gore etc.

Did they finish it yet? I lost track of it after [spoilers](/s"the aliens took over")

I'm just impressed how 1 man can be responsible for both 20th Century Boys and Monster. The pacing is so different in both of them, and he nails it. Love his works.
>> ARTICLE
I always felt that 20th Century Boys felt a lot like Monster. The constant suspense, I hated/loved it at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
I loved both of them, and the idea of a unknown, shadowy enemy like Friend and Johan is common. His style comes through in both, but the pacing is pretty much the polar opposite of each other. 20th century just keeps escalating and escalating, taking short breaks every now and again. It creates suspense through like 3 different time periods and multiple climaxes at once, whereas Monster goes the other way. It creates suspense with very slow, very deliberate development.

I find it amazing that one guy can write both of those stories, and have them both be cohesive and so good. He has completely mastered pacing.
>> ARTICLE
I think Pluto is my favorite. 
>> ARTICLE
20th Century Boys is probably the best manga I've read.

That's not irony. That is poetic justice.

I would argue that envy and possibly prides death are ironic but all of them are poetic justice. 
>> ARTICLE
"*If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?*"

Thanks for teaching me that device, I hope I can remember "poetic justice" the next time something similar comes up.

Wikipedia says it can often be accompanied by irony, though. Or rather "by an ironic twist of fate".
>> ARTICLE
Isn't that why they're called the 7 Deadly Sins?

They're meant to be destroyed by the antithesis of their entire being, making each of their conclusions diactic as apposed to synthetic.

It's called excellent screenwriting.
>> ARTICLE
Hoenheim says something about Father literally creating them by expelling his own basic desires (or at least trying to).
>> ARTICLE
man, I wish I could also just expel that stuff. Well, at least sloth would be nice. But I guess I would have to sacrifice some peoples souls for it...
>> ARTICLE
I thought Wrath's was that he died at peace. Also I thought greed's was because he did something selfless. And didn't pride not die because it exists in all humans? That was my take on their deaths.
>> ARTICLE
Different intepretations, but nevertheless you have to hand to the author for thinking of ending the 7 sins with appropriate ends. I didn't even think much about it until OP pointed it out. But makes sense regardless. 
>> ARTICLE
Wrath's was an interesting one. He was basically driven to be the strongest, and so in a way death was his escape from that life.

From what I rememeber, Greed was defeated when Greed realized that the reason why they wanted everything was so they could hide the pain of not having what they really wanted: Companionship. So he gave up everything to just save that concept of companionship.

Envy had the same thing. It was revealed that Envy was just always envious of people who had things to care about, and people to care about them. So they wanted to take things away from people so that maybe it would cause people to care about them.

I loved how they were portrayed. Apart from Gluttony and Sloth, their Sins were just a product of the vulnerabilities they felt. Usually they were things they missed out on from not being "human", not wanting to admit that they wanted the same things humans had.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't that the whole point? Father tried to become the perfect human by removing what he thought were flaws and manifesting them into his children. The main ones each eventually realized that what they are is part of what makes people human. 

The best justice is when Father tries to absorb Greed to make himself stronger. Despite literally removing Greed from his being, he still had Greed as he wanted to become stronger still. It backfired when Greed turned his body to useless carbon.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but the things he was removing were the things they used to cover up their insecurities. Father, to my knowledge, wasn't trying to remove those insecurities themselves. He already decided to do away with companionship, love, and other things like that. So while he removed the concept of Envy, for example, he didn't really seem to be trying to remove his need for love and happiness. He never wanted that in the first place. At least, that's what I got out of the character.

That was such a satisfying moment! Greed was probably my favorite of the Homunculi. What makes it even better is the fact that Greed only knew to use that tactic from his fights with Edward. So it was symbolic in that sense as well, because gaining some humanity is what allowed him the chance to critically injure Father.
>> ARTICLE
This is the exact opposite of irony. Irony is if something happens that's the opposite of what you expect. Considering they're NAMED AFTER SINS, it makes sense they die like their namesakes.
>> ARTICLE
You expected Gluttony to die via being eaten? And Envy to actually admit she's envious of humans? 
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty thematic, and FMA is not subtle. So I didn't know what Envy would envy, but I knew it would be her downfall. Ditto Gluttony.
>> ARTICLE
Yah, I think the correct term it's poetic justice (although I could be wrong).
>> ARTICLE
Technically yes. Since they're literally living embodiments of something immoral. 
>> ARTICLE
This isn't even the height of the poetic justice, irony, and plain tragedy in FMA:B. Just look at what the Alchemists who did Human Transmutation lost, and what their aspirations all were. It's pretty freaking amazing how the device worked.

Spoilers: But you knew that already.

Edward: [Spoiler](/s "Lost his leg because he wanted to walk with his mother, brother, and Winry. He also lost his arm because he wanted to hold hands with his mother, which was the second thing he lost.")

Alphonse: [Spoiler](/s "Lost his entire body because he wanted to hug his mother. No body means no hugging.")

Izumi: [Spoiler](/s "Lost her ability to reproduce. She tried desperatley to bring back her dead child, making it so that she could never, ever have a child.")

Roy: [Spoiler](/s "Lost his eyesight. He wanted to see the future, he wanted to see his nation when he eventually and inevitably becomes Furher Mustang. If he is blind, this task would be nigh on impossible to accomplish, being the Furher and seeing his nation when he became it's leader.")
>> ARTICLE
It has been a while since I have seen it but [did this really happen](/s "did it imply at the end that Roy got his eyesight back, or was it just the guy get his legs back?")
>> ARTICLE
Yes, both of those things are said to happen. He's making some serious reaches on this.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "To be fair, Father directly pointed these out when he had all of these characters gathered together as his sacrifices. Truth aka God seemed to delight in enacting poetic justice on alchemists who were so bold as to attempt human transmutation.")

I suppose it fits with the entire theme of FMA. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Equivalent exchange, indeed.

i don't thinks so. Both the manga and the show handled those deaths in ways that made sense, and the fact that the homunculus fell to their respective traits was relatively subtle, and not in your face.

And Ed, who has relied so heavily on alchemy, finally wins with his fist. Not his powers.

UH? The ultimate Irony of Fullmetal Alchemist is that the power Edd sought was the very thing he had to give up to get what he wanted. Isn't it?

I noticed as well, tho I disagree with the Wrath and Greed interpretations.
>> ARTICLE
He's not a womanizer...  He's got his main girl and that's that
>> ARTICLE
Wait, Mustang was actually a womanizer?
>> ARTICLE
I have to disagree with the greed one. Instead of being greedy and attempting to take the world for himself, he sacrificed his life in order to turn father into brittle carbon. He gave up his life for the companionship and love of others, for other people. In the end his "irony" was dying for the sake of others and not for the sake of himself, ie, greed.
>> ARTICLE
for those questioning roy being a womanizer, you have to remember his mother ran a whore house. assuming he was raised in it then certainly he would know how to womanize like a pro.

I'm not sure I understand the one about Pride...

It's kind of funny, since Envy seemed more prideful about not being human, but at the end of Pride's "life", he wound up turning into [FMA: B spoilers](/s "a baby. A human baby.")

Envy wasn't prideful, he was masking his jealousy under the veil of pride.

You're right! I totally forgot.

Pride thinks humans are beneath him and yet, in the end, he becomes one.

And lets not forget that Mike Wazawski killed markiplier
>> ARTICLE
Its been some time, I should go back and see this series again.
>> ARTICLE
This has probably been said but I agree with every one of these, except for Lust. I think the irony is that she used her beauty and seductive techniques to get what she wanted (or what father wanted) and was killed by a man who was not swooned or intimidated by her (since he cared for another, or it's insinuated at least). The irony is that she was killed by a man like Mustang, one so focused and intelligent that she couldn't fool him. 
>> ARTICLE
Mobile-friendly summary, please?
>> ARTICLE
Lust was killed by a womanizer
Gluttony was devoured
Envy killed himself out of jealousy
Sloth died in a long, hard battle
Wratg was killed by a vengeful man
Pride became one of the creatures he despises
Greed tried to get what he wanted and was absorbed

For one, I didn't know Envy was a man. And for two, that was hell trying to navigate on my phone.

I really like Mohiro Kitoh although some of his work is inconsistent some of it is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't that the point? How each 'sin' is defeated by itself.

I found it unironic in the sense of what the characters have conquered or needed to conquer in themselves. The Armstrongs and the Curtises killed sloth, because they had years of experience killing sloth in their own lives. A driven man like Mustang had to kill Lust to direct his focus on his actual goals. etc.

Of course it was. That doesn't happen accidentally. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes.. this was obviously done on accident... this many coincidences couldn't have been intentionally done by the mangaka.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't seem like the OP was suggesting such.  Also, irony is not defined by coincidence and is a common literary device that relies on incongruity and intended significance.  So the OP's use of "irony" is valid.
>> ARTICLE
No. Irony doesn't rely in intended significance. Intended significance on what? Irony is defined as an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often amusing as a result.

OP didn't find irony. OP found a pattern. A pattern deliberately written in.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think irony is really the suitable term to use here.  We don't say it's ironic when someone's faults end up being the end of them, we say it's fitting.

Who said it was an accident?

Okay, I like the show so far. I have just one little problem: the jokes about who the "Fullmetal Alchemist" is and about how tall Elric is.

Do the jokes stop at some point or do I have to endure them 64 episodes?

They never stop.  They do calm down as the tone gets more serious, but they never actually stop.

Holy shit I REALLY did not notice how much he grew up. I guess it's because it was such a slow growth like I was used to seeing him so I didn't notice it that much as he slowly grew. Just like how your friends think you are way taller after summer break but your family doesn't notice it all that much.
>> ARTICLE
I just marathoned the series like a week ago and the growth is slow but then in one episode he's significantly taller. (Like people mentioned, there is a slight time gap, plus certain circumstances surrounding the brothers at that time.) They did do a good job at being subtle about Ed's changes though; his face gradually gets more mature looking and it would take me by surprise every 15 episodes or so.

Well, this episode has my favorite quote from anything, I even have it as my phone background.

Just joining in now, so I had some catching up to do. Never seen this before so might as well give my thoughts so far;

**Episode 1**

* Pretty kickass OP, super catchy, can tell I won't be skipping it for the time being 
*  "Freezing and boiling, the elements of water" Gee...thanks for explaining that to me...
* Pretty great animation for the fight scenes so far, love the lightning and steam effects.
* Not entirely sold on the humour though. Not really a huge fan of Shounen's though so that might explain it. Think I would enjoy more it if it took itself more seriously than it currently does.
* Have to say the art style seems pretty unique to me, really fits the setting of the anime IMO
*  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone! Voldemort arch-enemy confirmed.
* Soundtrack is awesome as well. Sounds great and is never too overpowering, nice.
* Grizzly eye-patch guy being badass as expected, interested to see how the cast so far develops.
* Wait so if breaking the seals stops the magic then why the hell did no one think of that before the manic laughter guy went super saiyan? 
* Oh no looks like eye-patch guy is the father of an important character and furher, looks like he is doomed to die.
* Flamboyant Mr.Muscle = 'Bro' 2.0 
* General Esdeaths sister makes apperance
* ED is quite charming, not really sold on the song though so will probs skip unless it changes later on.

Looks like it has a lot of potential so long as it doesn't fall into the trap of explaining things to the viewer as if they are five years old. Hope the characters get fleshed out too but with 64 episodes this seems guaranteed. Also Akame ga kill references are because I just recently finished it and it seems somewhat similar to this. 

**Episode 2**

* Nice to see alchemy getting some explanation.
* Paid more attention to the OP animation this time. MC has a sister? Unlike the two brothers she doesn't seem to get the lightning treatment so will have to see where she is at. Also I'm guessing the tall guy with the blond pony tail is their dad? 
* Eh still not sold on the typical shounen humour so I hope it gets kept to a minimum when shit hits the fan.
* So human transmutation seems to be foreshadowing that someone has to die for another person to come back to life, guessing that's how the girl dies and his brother comes back.
* **God is a dick**
* Looks like he got his brother back through the power of love and a little bit of magic...zzz...guess that makes my prediction wrong!
* Like the character development for the most part, starting to get the hype at this point. Feel like personal loss is handled much more maturely in this show than Akame ga kill which is good.
* "You transformed my automail, didn't you?!?" "So you're gonna transform my head instead!?" Ok, I'll admit I laughed at that.
* Looks like the girl is this shows resident Tsundere. "Like I care if I'm cute, I'm only helping you until your limbs are better **BAKA**" 
* I also like the fact that the MCs powers aren't just pulled out of his ass like they seem to be in Hunter x Hunter, he at least has a reason for having them. A la **God is a helpful asshole** 

Guess that ends episode 2, should be up to date with this thread starting now. HYPE. 

**Episode 3**

* "He [God] can resurrect the dead huh, sounds fishy" You realize this is the same God that took your limbs and body away right? 'course it's fishy!
* Dude has crazy eyesight to be able to see that ring from where he was standing
* Wait you're still an atheist after coming face to face with God? Am I missing something here...
* Sheesh 'Look at the MC he is so small hahahaha', they really are forcing that joke down the viewers throat holy shit
* Looks like MC is /r/atheism incarnate
* I can see why people are mistaking who the full metal alchemist is, I mean he's kinda the part metal alchemist next to his brother. 
*  Yeah lady, [THIS GUY](http://i.imgur.com/1lTuM8h.png) is surely acting in your best interests.
* 'Tearing my clothes off because I'm a badass even though that clearly shows which parts of my body are made of metal and which are not'
* Love how the MC runs animation-wise!
* I was thinking that the bell was going to be used as a weight to rope down the tower but I actually really like the way they incorporated it into Mr.two-dimensional evil priest's monologue instead 
* Soundtrack continues to be epic
* Esdeaths sister even has the tattoo in the same place, it was meant to be

Welp that is me up to date. Having fun so far, not quite certain this show will be worth a 10/10 by the end of it but like I said I am no shounen fan and it's still early on that's for sure. 

Bring on Epsiode 4!

Bearing in mind that I have far from finished Hunter x Hunter, so take this with a pinch of salt, but I found the fact that a 12 year kid doing near impossible physical feats and going toe to toe with people twice his age and size with no explanation to be really jarring.
>> ARTICLE
While it's never fully explained where his superhuman abilities come from, it's made apparent Gon is special when he [](/s "reels in that big ass fish"). Considering you're only 5 episodes in, don't let the the 12-year-old superhuman thing get in the way of your enjoyment. Attribute it to genetics and being brought up in nature--if that isn't good enough, you're going to experience a lot more that feels jarring. Otherwise it's a fantastic ride and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

Well I'm gonna stick with it through to the end but I can't say it doesn't bother me.

> 'Tearing my clothes off because I'm a badass even though that clearly shows which parts of my body are made of metal and which are not'

I think that's the point.
>> ARTICLE
There isn't actually a "god", you seem to be interpreting it as something monotheistic. The simple no spoiler answer is that it's not.
>> ARTICLE
Huh? Could you explain that to me in spoiler tags? (I've seen the show before, but seem to have forgotten what you're referring to)

He is known as "Truth" in most translations which is a more accurate answer translation

>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Yeah, but he's pretty much an all-powerful, all-knowing being. And the characters treat him like god, so...")
>> ARTICLE
Ah well I guess that makes more sense then. I watched the scene in episode 2 where the MC performs the ritual and gets sucked into that alternate world and the 'being' there referred to itself as a God so that is where I was getting the idea from.
>> ARTICLE
Some translations refer to him as a "god" but the original translation for the white man at the gate is "truth". I think he refers to himself in many names and one of them is "god".
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, some characters actually do call him God
>> ARTICLE
> Feel like personal loss is handled much more maturely in this show than Akame ga kill which is good.

Oh trust me, seeing Akame ga Kill after seeing Fullmetal Alchemist completely ruins Akame ga Kill because deaths in Akame ga Kill feel extremely cheap compared to Fullmetal (there are a couple that don't impact the viewer so much but overall is much better handled)
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, part metal alchemist was a good one 
>> ARTICLE
Nice to know the thoughts of a first-time viewer! Yeah, FMA:B does have a somewhat disappointing start for something that's hyped up to be the best thing ever. But let me assure you, it gets really, *really* good. (especially after episode 15-ish)

...Please do share your thoughts on the next episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Looking forward to it then! And will do.
>> ARTICLE
1 quick thing, he didnt get his brother back through the power of love and some magic, he gave up his arm to affix his soul to the armor, so its still according to the law of equivalent exchange, and it makes sense according to the rules of alchemy :)
>> ARTICLE
Interesting...does the concept of equivalent exchange get expanded upon later on in the show? At the minute it is hard for me to grasp what is equivalent to what. 
>> ARTICLE
I understand that at its most basic, when Ed creates a spear, the ground where he made it from is gone, aka conservation of matter. Human transmutations don't do so well because there isn't anything that is as valuable as a  human life. 
>> ARTICLE
I really like that explanation, thanks.


 
>> ARTICLE
if you're wondering if they ever specifically state exactly what is equivalent to what, they dont, it would be waaaay too hard, and the writer would just be cornering himself for no real reason

but they do constantly deal with the theme of equivalent exchange, since that is the most important law of alchemy, and the whole reason why the elric bros are looking for the philosopher stone

oh, PS: Not even Ed knew what was going to happen when he tried to affix Al's soul, he did say he was willing to give his whole body when he did it.
>> ARTICLE
 Don't compare FMA with AgK. xD The first 10 episodes were good, but after that shit went down. I hate shounens for the most part and FMAB is my favourite anime don't worry.

As someone who watched the first few episodes of FMA, I'm kinda happy they're going through them pretty fast. I found the original's first eps a little too slow-paced, which is partly why I didn't watch the entire show.

[preview - plsno it's only ep4](http://i.imgur.com/KjUZlh0.png)
>> ARTICLE
Stap
>> ARTICLE
[my personal feelings](#s "Brother Ep4, or more accurately first half, didn't really hit anywhere as hard as the original FMA episode 7. It goes through really fast, and there's only a few moments of moping before quickly moving on to other things.")
>> ARTICLE
They're definitely going through the beginning much faster. They cover the first 30 episodes of the 2003 show in 13 episodes in Brotherhood, which is the point when things start to differ from what you might remember.
>> ARTICLE
So, I had no idea this was happening and decided to watch the whole series myself for the first time over the last week. 

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the series and hope any first time watchers enjoy it as much as I did.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, Episode 4 here we go.

The search for the philosophers stone goes on, but what is that thing? why is it so special? Later it is revealed that it allows to break the equivalent exchange rule to make it able to create something from nothing. neat concept, let's see how much further they're gonna develop this.

The talk at the church is very iconic and deep. [Especially this sentence](http://i.imgur.com/NVc9KIi.png), very telling if you think about it: we dont know if theyre gonna revive their mom or not, but this heavily suggets they wont. You cant create life out of mere things, it just doesnt work.

The fight was well made imo considering the huge skillgap between the two. The priest literally got rekkt real bad. 

Actually, I really underestimated the comedy in this series. [It clearly is funnier than I expected, good job of the creators.](http://i.imgur.com/T8VFgKi.jpg) They managed to combine something very serious and managed to make it funny.

Audio was amazing too. Pretty hyped to see the (appearant) main antagonist especially the eater. Looking forward to see how he's gonna interact with the two who dont have real bodies!

Cya next episode bois.
>> ARTICLE
1st time viewer? I'm tagging everybody to not accidentally spoil something
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, first time ever. I also haven't seen the original series or read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher. Pretty good so far, didn't expect it to be so funny too.  Not #1 on MAL good yet, but I can see how it'll definitely get pretty good. Excited to be watching it with you guys!
>> ARTICLE
So I remember this episode from the original FMA, and I didn't notice anything too different. What was interesting this time around though was Vic Mignogna's lines. I remember listening to the [ANNCast interview of Vic](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anncast/2013-08-29), and he talked a lot about his Christian faith. Yet here he plays Edward, a very scientific/godless character. I always wondered how actors felt about playing characters of different religions/world views. Not really a big deal, just something I thought about while watching it. 

I will say that the whole joke about Al being the Full Metal Alchemist is getting old real fast, but its been said in this thread that it dies out as the series goes. God I hope so. I will say that the one thing I really didn't like about the original series and this series (so far) is the humor, or rather, the visual style of humor they use (like Al being flustered, Edward being mad, etc). Not a big deal, but it just doesn't work for me. Which I know is kind of hypocritical when I like that kind of visual humor in Lovely Complex, but (with rare exception) it feels out of place in the FMA series. Still, a good episode. 
>> ARTICLE
And now we will start grabbing into the meat of the series. MMMhh tasty flesh.
>> ARTICLE
Great Episode.
>> ARTICLE
I think we already discussed that the first few episodes are going to be rushed a bit, though this one seemed too fast for me. Probably because the original had a bit more story to it, especially with [spoiler for FMA](/s "the big reveal if what the "resurrected" fiance really was"). And I always feel anxious whenever Alphonse is in battle because [light spoiler](/s "of the blood mark and what would happen if it got damaged in any way") even though I know he's going to be fine. 
Also... Dat face http://i.imgur.com/BmjLX2B.jpg

Edit: Added spoiler mark

I really wanted to see the resurrected fiance. The birds making up his body and speaking were really creepy.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's incredibly convenient that [this](http://i.imgur.com/qeHOnbS.jpg) arrived at my door today, guess I'll be joining in on this rewatch too. 

I'm just gonna throw it out there for any first time watchers, but I feel the 2003 anime had a better start, but Brotherhood is 3 times better overall.

Sorry if I'm too late to get answers, but there's one thing I don't understand though. [Ep. 3 Spoiler](#s "If the philosophers stone was a fake, how was the father able to do everything he did?")

EDIT: Just started Ep. 4 and [Ep. 4 Spoiler](#s "They'er also wondering how he was able to do all those things with a fake stone, thank god. It botheres me that they didn't say anything in Ep. 3, but I guess I'll have my answer if I continue watching")
>> ARTICLE
The other just plain bad episode in the series, along with episode 1. They really butchered Liore.
>> ARTICLE
Bad relative to how it was in FMA? Yes. "Just plain bad"? No. 
>> ARTICLE
I count it as just plain bad. Plagued with mediocre attempts at humor and rushed to the point where none of it can be taken seriously and investment in what's going on is at an extreme low.

When you take into consideration that the Liore plotline also serves as foreshadowing for what comes later in the series, its treatment here becomes even more insulting. When comparing it to both other versions of FMA (2003 and the manga), then it looks even *worse*.
>> ARTICLE
Upvoted because being downvoted for your opinion without being rude makes me mad. 
>> ARTICLE
For me it only looks worse in comparison to manga and the first anime, if I look at the Liore episode alone I have no complaints
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I would say it was equal or better episode to the original FMA, and a much better aftermarth.

Woop Woop! I'm back. Looking forward to this episode since it has been hyped up a little. Thanks for all the info last time guys.

**Episode 4**

* Holy crap that guy wins best mustache of the century award 
* NO MUSTACHE DUDE DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HIM
* ***Worst anime ever***
* I really can't decide whether this furher president is a good guy or a bad guy, dude has eyes that range from 'old gramps' to 'pure hatred'
*  Kinda weird transition from a Chimera asking to die to a cute dog jumping on the MC, not sure if it wants me to take it seriously or not
* This guy is straight out of Log Horizon
* [Old man Shiroe](http://i.imgur.com/GNTxIYS.png) **CONFIRMED**
* Looks like [Alexander](http://i.imgur.com/IgwPAfc.png) even has the same running animation as the MC
* People hyped this episode up and now the little girl is hugging her dog saying she misses her Dad. Let's hope this is a happily ever after episode, right? guys? please?
* [Never forget ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/QsYbapG.png)
* Oh no old man shiroe is trying so hard to continue being a state alchemist but that puts him straight in the firing line of Mr.statealchemistkiller
* "Lets all play together tomorrow"- Will there even be a tomorrow? Stop forshadowing ;_;
* O_O Errr...that Chimera has suspiciously similar hair to his daughter...
* Holy shit that was his wife asking to die...
* "Let's play"
* She was crying when her Dad died- that is commitment!
* Still won't forgive you for what you did to Mustache dude, **asshole**!

Well that episode was a bit of roller coaster. I can see why it was rated so highly, Mustache dudes death really did hit me. 

*'Lets all watch together tomorrow'*

~~Only, in Brotherhood I didn't think it was that bad. Original though...~~

Wow, I ment that I thought the original was better. What a brain fart. I think the original did this better as it had more buildup, Brotherhood it's only like, one episode.

>> ARTICLE
still couldnt hold my tears there
>> ARTICLE
I'll agree that original did this arc better, even if just because it give more time to get attached with Nina.
>> ARTICLE
And then that ending...
>> ARTICLE
They intentionally edited down the things from the manga the first series covered
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what to say here...

I am just glad I picked this anime up.
>> ARTICLE
I never actually watched this episode, and I'm never going to. I already watched the story of Nina and Alexander in the 2003 anime, and that's more than enough for a lifetime for me, thank you.
>> ARTICLE
The 2003 anime handles it a fair bit better, I thought- Brotherhood crams the whole story into a single episode. Seriously limits the emotional attachment you have a chance to form with the characters. 
>> ARTICLE
But there is a difference from how it was in FMA 2003

[this episode](/s "the scarred guy also killed Tucker, not just Nina") 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, this is an important difference, read this spoiler text if you didn't rewatch.

This episode had some great comedic moments in it, you damn dog.

Oh man this episode brings back memories. It was 2011 or so, and I was in the living room laying down on the couch. I was just surfing through channels, trying to find something to watch, when all of a sudden, I come across this show called "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood." I decide to check it out, even though it was almost over. My reaction was something along these lines.

*Yo, what's with the robot?*
*Why are they in the rain?*
*Who's house is this?*

*What's with this guy?*

*WHAT THE HELL IS THAT DOG?*

*YO THIS GUY IS CREEPY!*

*THAT DOG EVEN TALKS CREEPY!*

*WHY THE FUCK IS THAT DOG CALLING HIM HER BIG BROTHER?!*

*WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE TRANSFORMED HIS DAUGHTER INTO THAT DOG?!*

*HE USED A DOG AS WELL! THE FUCKER (Or more like... the Tucker^^I'll ^^see ^^myself ^^out)*

*THE ROBOT IS HIS BROTHER?!*

*WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS ARM?!*

*NO DOGGY LET HIM KEEP PUNCHING HIM!*

*YOU CAN'T CHANGE HER BACK? DON'T DO THIS TO ME!*

*WHO'S THAT SCAR MAN?!*

*YEAH KILL THE ASSHOLE!*

*NO DON'T KILL THE DOGGY!*

*WHY YOUR EYES RED?!*

Immediately after the credits, I ran to my room and found the show on the Funimation youtube channel. In 2 months, even with my horrible WiFi, I finished the show. This is what got me into anime. All because of some jerk, his daughter, and his dog.

If anyone is interested /r/FullmetalAlchemist is having their own rewatch of the series, with a live stream every Thursday.

Okay seriously, why does everyone freak out about Nina? I get it; it's sad. It's really fucked up. I was shocked the first time I saw it in FMA. But those 4chan posts, and now I'm seeing people say they won't watch this episode? Are we all just circlejerking here or are people really that upset about it? I know that just because it's fiction doesn't mean you aren't attached to characters or emotionally invested in the show and I've cried over anime, but some of you are acting like you were seriously traumatized by this experience, which seems a little silly to me.
>> ARTICLE
The 2003 version let viewers get more attached to her and many people were reminded probably of someone they know who is like her. That made it sad for a lot of people who watched the original.
>> ARTICLE
It was the first really truly fucked up thing I had ever seen when I watched it back in 2003-4 or whenever it aired. I was like 11 or 12. It just kinda scarred me, and I had trouble falling asleep that night, and couldn't stop thinking about it. Fucked me up real good. 

But that's just me. 
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I guess I hadn't thought of younger kids watching it. I can understand that.
>> ARTICLE
Besides the 2003 series let you get much more emotionaly invested with her and her death had bigger impact. 

Also my gf watched the 2003 the first time when she was 17 and she still gets really upset when I make that the dog goes: da.. dy.. joke. Some people are just a little bit more sensitve.

I really really liked this episode. I'm really liking this show now. But is the show just a "person you meet a day" or what?
>> ARTICLE
It really isn't. As many people including myself have stated in previous threads, the studio gambled on enough people having watched the original FMA, which is why Brotherhood rushes through the first 30-ish chapters of the manga. Nina's story lasted 3-4 episodes in FMA 2003.

In any case, the show is not in any way episodic. There is a main villain, a (rather well written) plot and a very conclusive ending. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I'm glad it isn't, then, because I feel like I wouldn't like that.
>> ARTICLE
I guess the first episode (which is one of 2 episodes that are filler in the entire show) doesn't help since it adds to the "problem of the week" feeling early on, at least the next few episodes continue the story and don't really have this problem, there are a few more episodes where new characters are introduced but they will get rarer and rarer (by episode 15 you should know most characters that are regulars in the show and by then the remaining characters are either a mystery (because you know they are there somewhere, you just don't know their identity) or are in somewhere so remote that the plot will introduce them way later)

>> ARTICLE
Completely agree.
>> ARTICLE
Oii, here it is, episode 4. Only series besides Nisekoi I've watched and listened to the entire OP and ED, its really good.

I think I'll call this antagonist badglass. He looks really badass, but the glasses are ridicoulous. lol

Oi, what a healthy boss-subordinate relationship. ITS A TRAP ITS A TRAP! Calm down ed!

I'd be interested to know whether he really is a genius or just so interested that hes able to fully immerse himself. [Well, atleast he tries...](http://i.imgur.com/MEzpuIx.jpg)

I dont want to say I knew it, but I sorta did. Why'd the wife leave so easily? What's with that promise to play tomorrow? [Dude this is not okay.](http://i.imgur.com/1BSdSk6.png)

[What a tragic scene.](http://i.imgur.com/8ZHbEaS.png) the cornered beast is the most fearsome they say. Ed facing his own past and faults here, tough moment for him. 

[So young yet so sorrowful.](http://i.imgur.com/rVR1lix.png) Moments like these allow humans to grow and develop.

Even though its cruel, its better that NinaxAlexander thingie died. [To keep on living like that,](http://i.imgur.com/o3LGGxt.png), the father dead, that would be impossibile.

Overall very good episode, pretty emotional aswell. I guess its preparing us for the feels rollercoasters that will be coming ahead, I guess. The funeral-rain scene of the colonel is pretty famous I'd like to say. We also get a lot of insight into the feelings of Ed and the actions and reasoning of this killer. Surely excited with the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say this episode is more famous for the shock value, a little girl we barely knew being transformed by her father into a monster is pretty shocking

Latter episodes that are known for being emotional impact the viewer way more because it impacts characters we started to care about, mark this one: episode 22, you will not be ready for it when we start discussing it
>> ARTICLE
Well in the 2003 (original) version you get to know her better and you feel for her more because there are more episodes featuring her. In the original, it was meant to be sad whereas in brotherhood it may be for shock as you said. 
>> ARTICLE
Ugh, I'm prepared. let's see if FMA:B will be able to break me!

I also was shocked but not crying yet. thats just what I was talking about, but you have a point. See you in later discussions then ;)

Regarding last episode, how did Father Cornell disregard the Law of Equal Exchange if his Philosopher's Stone wasn't actually real? I just don't get it. Unless, of course, the answer is spoilery and will be revealed later or something of the like.

**Episode 17**

* He said you were skilled Maria, be happy!
* Sergeant Brosh to save the day
* Winry & The Elrics reaping in the feels
* If only they could use Barry to confess Maria's innocence. Or at least if Mustang gets his confession he can fight for Marias case.
* Oh wow please tell me Barry is going to be the one to save her
* Barry+Maria, I ship it.
* 'Honey I'm home!'
* Looks like Mustang is out on patrol. He knows of Barry's existence so I doubt he doesn't know what is going on.
* "Oh so she did it" Guessing the explosion by mustang was part of the plan?
* Huh, that body is appropriately crisp. Still standing by it being deliberate. No way would Barry have reacted as if the plan was successful if she was just to die. It's also a bit of a TV trope to have 'body is unrecognizable because it is so burnt' so as to fake someones death.
* DAYYYYUUUUM ED JUST GOT PIMP SLAPPED! TOUCH THE FIRE AND YOU GET BURNT SUCKA'
* Mustang really does play the bad guy well
* I swear a tooth abnormality was used to fake someones death in CSI, can't remember which series though
* Mustang getting in that coded talk at the hospital, this is really not subtle.
* Envy is not a smart person
* Mustangs subordinates taking leave because of his actions is a good cover, you can't fool me sir!
* Woah what is that theme playing after mustang says he has got into fishing? Sounds epic
* Yep the Major understood mustangs coded talk
* Woah it's Barry number two, *wuuuuuuuuuut*

**Episode 18**

* The Xerxes ruins huh? 
*  An Alchemist who arrived and taught everyone alchemy huh? He looks like one of the Fathers to me. Probably the one that isn't trying to sacrifice humans...or maybe they both did and they just spread it throughout different areas?
* "Destroyed in one night" Do you think this is maybe where the Sins were created? The result of which was an explosion that wiped out the people there
* Huh there is that thingy mabob from the first opening
* Maybe the people here were actually sacrifices? It's obvious that for the most part the city is intact except for natural ageing of the abandoned buildings. Could that symbol on the wall have been the alchemy circle that was used to create the Sins?
* I KNEW IT! She's alive
* Looks like the revolution starts here!
* Looks like Mustang also watched the same episode of CSI I did
* "Fish out the mastermind behind this" - was Mustang saying that he is into fishing a subtle pun? If so that is awesome
* I guess that guy is going to get a bit of a shock when he recognizes the drawing of lust as his new girlfriend
* "You should conserve your fluids" heheh
* Barry vs Barry! Didn't realize it was episode 64 already!
* Ooooh there is a dragon on that transmutation circle. I'm definitely leaning towards this being the place the Sins were made
* Damn didn't Scar kill the rockbells? He literally killed the few people that were on his peoples side. He also killed mustache dude. He is a very misguided person. I smell a redemption arc.
* Are the rockbells gravestones next to Eds mother? If so I guess that is  how he winds up meeting his Dad when he goes to pay his respects
* Is the way to kill gluttony by shooting him in his chest eye?

Well that is yesterdays thread done, Onward!

**Episode 19**

* Hmm looking at the opening it does seem like the fight between Ed and Scar happens in an abandoned town. Maybe here at Xerxes place?
* "make sure you come back" .. "I promise" NO DON'T PROMISE, THAT'S HOW CHARACTERS DIE!!! But seriously, do you think this is foreshadowing that when Al gets back he will have his real body again?
* Ah so gluttony has his mark of his tongue. That makes my whole 'shoot him in the third eye' theory wrong.
* Mustang+Hawkeye is another ship that has set sail for me
* I don't know why for someone as smart as Mustang & Co. it hasn't clicked that you need to destroy the mark to kill the sins. 
* Oh man here comes the girlfriend realization! *Teehee*
* Lust has some interesting boob physics
* Great she showed you where to shoot, finally get it now guys??
* JEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN
* FUCK YEAH MUSTANG! 
* Can he use the power of Philo to save Jean?
* **Yep.** I should probably have a policy to wait before I make predictions that get answered two seconds later
* Oh man now Wrath is here? Everything is happening at once. Guess we will also see Ling and the Ninjas fight Wrath like in the OP?
* I seriously want Hawkeye to be the one to kill lust like, "Scew you Lust! Mustang is  ***my*** man" 
* Aww disappointed...the ship has sunk
* OH MAN IT COULD STILL HAPPEN! The ship has lit flares!
* I just noticed, is that mosaic thing in the background in the same image as the transmutation circle we saw in Xerxes?
* AWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAH SHOOT THAT BITCH! 1 GUN, TWO GUNS, 3 GUNS!
* Mustang has been really hitting the gym. Hawk*eye* has some good *eye*candy ey? heh. heh. heh. (Let me have that one)
* Meh, Lusts death was awesome but I kinda wanted to see Hawkeye be the one to land the final blow as one last 'fuck you'. Oh well, at least the ship is real
* Hmm wonder what Wrath is thinking. He could have destroyed them then and there so it seems like he actually kinda cares about them even if he is still a sin
* I think I came close to wetting myself when Al's arm fell off right when Winry was about to cry.
* Barry killed himself ;_; so poetic 
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH THE TIME HAS COME! EDS DAD IS HERE!

**Episode 20**

* I think Hohenheim might be the only one to (indirectly) call him tall
* I get the feeling his Dad actually cares but wow, he's suck a dick about they way he goes about it
* RoboDog never forgets and he *never forgives*
* He fucking knew Ed was there and yet he decided to make him feel even more shitty about what he did? Man he might be beating Father sin for worst father of the year
* Winry really does get a shitty deal in all of this. She deserves a holiday...
* "Geez...you and brother always get mad before I ever can, so I never get to" - Keep being fantastic, Al
* I'm surprised Ed just let him go like that. I mean I get that there is a lot of hate between them but still...
* The PTSD of digging up the person you thought was your mother must be insane
* Not sure how I feel about Ed telling master his revelation. On the one hand the honest truth is good but damn, maybe the false belief was best kept as it was.
* Ed went *full Winry* on Al
* He still hasn't mention meeting their Dad...that's the kind of thing that you don't want to keep a secret from Al if you don't want him having another existential crisis
* What's with the cheery/epic sounding music while people are having emotional breakdowns?
* Winry checking Ed out :D More like she's trying to say he's grown but whatever *shush you*

So that is that! 4 entire episodes and it didn't take me as long as I expected although that is mostly due to the absence of any theories. In my defense most of what happened was either fight scenes or revelations that I had previously anticipated so I didn't really have much to comment on. Regardless that is one more Sin down and just 5 more to go and we haven't even met pride yet! I'm slightly disappointed that Hohenheim just walked off as I expected him to tag along with Ed even if he was unwelcome :( Maybe he is going off to find someone who can teach him how not to be an asshole *101*

Oh my some of these predictions are pretty good, you watch too much TV. I fell right into thinking Mustang was a mindless asshole until his plan was explicitly revealed.

Also just to clarify the sin's tattoo doesn't indicate the sin's weakspot necessarily, stones *are* within the core of their bodies though.

Guilty. I had a similar reaction to Steins;gate, there was nothing that really caught me off guard, even towards the end.

Episode 19 has a special place in my heart. I was sporadically following the manga, and when they announced Brotherhood I said "okay, cool" and then sorta forgot about it. Still followed the manga, I think it was in the early 90s chapter-wise. Fast forward a few months and I spotted the show on Funi's site. I saw that 19 was the most recent episode, and given the title and thumbnail knew what it was. And then I watched it.

I want this anime to end but I really don't want it to end ;_; On the one hand I'll have a lot more free time to do what I want and I'll get to see the conclusion to this epic saga. On the other hand I'll have a void in my heart after the show is over and another void in my heart as I won't have people like /u/Illidan1943, /u/huloca and /u/xArDDe to throw theories at :( 

Life is cruel yo.

**Episode 42**

> ~~Alchemists~~ Hiromu Arakawa often hides ~~their~~ her research using trope and hidden meanings to prevent ~~ordinary~~ people who are not me from deciphering it

* Mr.Potato head: Fullmetal Alchemist edition
* I wonder if Scars arm tattoo is the missing peice to these research documents
* Flip the pages over! Elementary my dear Alphonse Watson!
* Briggs ain't gonna fall...right...guys?
* War sucks
* Oh hey it's Rose. She is awfully cheery. Looks like she took Eds words to heart
* Man's gotta eat when a mans gotta eat'
* It certainly does seem to be taking forever for the eventual Hohenheim+Al meet up. We're 42 episodes in!
* Hohenheim barely seems bothered with Pride chasing him. He almost seems to respect Pride in a way. 1 Vote for Hohenheim spin off series
* "U mad bro?"
* Ooooh they are going to meet again! I'm about excited as a pre-teen girl at Christmas
* "Just a little deceleration of war" Hohenheim; my hype can't take it anymore
* [Kimblee](http://i.imgur.com/LPy2rwz.png) is going to light the biggest fire the north has ever seen
* Get the feeling Zampano is simply baiting the Sins with Marcoh. Though it is possible he is genuinely betraying them

**Episode 43**

* Poor wildlings :(
* Ok I guess he is just betraying them. Die in a fire Zampano
* Wrath picked his bride himself once he was Fuhrer, just like Mustang **is** going to pick Hawkeye at the end of this
* Oh I was right before. Don't die in fire Zampano
* Now would be a good time for Ed to show up and tag team with Al for the Envy kill
* Or you know...Just Scar will do.
* Marcoh going super saiyan, holy alchemy!
* R.I.P Envy. Envy is the best sin so far.
* Nooo don't send MayMay away
* The team is splitting apart again. Where is my revolution :(
* Are we going to get Ling back through Greed's desire for revenge against Wrath? I want it so bad
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH THE ARMSTRONG'S MEET AT LAST
* Well that was pretty mean of you to say Satsuki :(
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH SO THEY WEREN'T LYING ABOUT HAVING AN IMMORTAL ARMY. 
* Guess they will be animated by the mass sacrifice but I can't think why Father would want an army when there won't be anyone left to oppose him
* So many after credit scenes
* heheh Winry
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH IT'S HAPPENING. WHAT IS THIS EPISODE IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE.
* That is how you do an after credits scene FYI

**Episode 44**

* SAY SOMETHING GOD DAMN IT AL
* Stop teasing me FMA:B, I want daddy issues so bad
* DAMN RIGHT YOU GIVE ME THIS FATHER/SON BONDING
* Stop sweet talking her Rose. Her ship set sail long ago
* 'Banks Bank' the most inventive name for a bank
* Ed is straight rocking that white jacket
* Cat is out he bag for Al and Hohenheim
* He is waiting for "The day" and it is in some way connected to the sun god leto. Looks like my theory about him needing a solar eclipse or solstice of some sort might be true.
* This new Greed is a dick
* "Get your shit together" Real talk right there
* Greed vs Wrath round two now please
* WHY DID YOU HAVE THAT AS THE AFTER CREDITS SCENE?!? DON'T YOU KNOW I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW NOW?!? GOD DAMN YOU!!!!!!

MEH. Guess I got what I asked for, FMA:B you sneaky devil.

Hmm that is not how you spell the best girls name...

Write ups on that show have been suspended. I'll continue watching it but I'm just not enjoying it to be honest. I would rather spend time on write ups for shows I am more enthusiastic about.

And here I thought I had something to look forward to when I finished my exams this week, continuing my speculation and tinfoiling with /u/rascorpia on EVA :(.

I just checked your currently watching list, damn, that's a big list. Good choice on TTGL. I think that is the only show that gets better with every episode. If you're enjoying it this much already, you're going to love what's going to happen, and the last few episodes might even be on par with FMA:B's last 4 episodes, so you have something to look forward to :)
>> ARTICLE
> I just checked your currently watching list, damn, that's a big list.

Haha. I'm not really suited to binge watching so I like to bounce between different shows, the result of which is evident. I have TTGL on glorious high definition box set so man is it a beauty to look at. 
>> ARTICLE
One tip for TTGL. Once you have finished the show, go watch the second film. While the 2 films are just a recap of the story, the studio had a lot more money, so the fights look even better. You haven't really seen TTGL untill you have seen the films edition of the final fight in all its 20 minute glory, including all new scenes that make something you thought was the epitome of epic even more epic. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh don't worry, my boxset has the whole lot. The TV series, the films, bonus extras such as storyboards and test animation footage. I am fully prepared :D

Yup, this is exactly how I felt when I followed the manga and the anime until the end, in 2010, and also how I felt everytime I reread and rewatched this masterpiece. You might get depressed when it ends, but it's totally worth it.

> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH IT'S HAPPENING. WHAT IS THIS EPISODE IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE.

If you can, [see if any library near you carries it.](http://www.worldcat.org/title/fullmetal-alchemist/oclc/60716740)  
>> ARTICLE
Nice linking with Worldcat! Libraries very often have manga section, which I think people forget. And if they don't, well, that's the beauty of inter-library loans.
>> ARTICLE
Do it. It's only 108 chapters long and it's my favourite of all time. It's the only manga I ever bought and the one I most read. Also it's the reason why I started reading Silver Spoon, the manga that Arakawa wrote after FMA was over.
>> ARTICLE
How's Silver Spoon for somebody who doesn't enjoy most Slice of Life shows?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's a hard question. When you think about Silver Spoon, it's normal to think it won't be something too good. I mean, it's an anime about farm. I almost didn't read the manga because of it. The important though is what made me do it: Arakawa's writing.

You might not enjoy most Slice of Lifes, but I guess you can agree that what makes a SoL good are the characters, right? Well, think about the characters in FMA. Think about their development through the series. Now imagine how it would be in a SoL.   
The main character from Silver Spoon comes from a big city. He knows nothing about farm but still isolates himself in an agricultural high school. I guess I could say that Arakawa "transmutates" his character through the series. First we get to understand him(or in other words, comprehend), then he gets destroyed and reconstructed by the environment he's in. I really like to read/watch that happening.  
That's not all of it though. Hachiken is not the only character with depth in Silver Spoon. You get to see a lot of background on the characters around him, their motives, their dreams, their failures...  
You get to learn a little bit about farm and whatnot too, but I don't know how many people are interested on this.

In the end I guess it sounds like just another Slice of Life. Well, it's hard to describe SoL. When I started reading Silver Spoon - back in 2011 - I had never heard about this genre. I learned about it through Silver Spoon, and it might be the reason why I like the genre so much. I think everyone should give it a try, at least to the first season of the anime. The anime is a good introduction to the series. There's just 22 episodes(11 each season) that cover 75 chapters of the manga.  
So far there are 108 chapters translated - the same number as the chapters from FMA. It must be a sign. I wouldn't ignore a sign like this if I were you!

* I require more bath scenes of Winry. Please. Pleeeaase.

* Well, atleast you're not a mute Rose.

* I require more happy scenes of Winry. I'll take everything as long as she isn't crying.

* Hey Bato! I'm guessing I'm fucking up your name as well.

* I think this reveal would've been better if it came before olivier's reveal last episode....no wait, it's the same reveal. huh.

* Hey Mr. Greed! you're not supposed to be in a place like this!

* Mr. Ho's vague threats don't really work if the viewer already knows he's good anyway :s Seriously, the whole "IS MR.HO EVIL?" stick is soooo 20 episodes ago.

* Bank teller girl looks nice

* This scene sure is exciting

* DON'T CALL HIM SHORT BOY

* HOLY FUCK RIGHT TROUGH THE WALL THIS IS SOME ROBOCOP SHIT

* I was going to comment on ed dropping the episode title but than they showed naked winry in the splash shot again and I lost my train of thought

* lol, the "hostage" scene.

* "What is love, baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more"

* Very inconspicious Ed

* Who wants to live forever? 

* Waiting for the day of Black Sun? :3 We avatar now

* OH CRAP IT'S BITO. Bido? not bato anyway. CRAP NOW HE'S DEAD.

* Bido ;-; Greed ;\_; those flashbacks ;____;

* "They're the only part of you that you chose"...like how Wrath chose his wife? Imagine the rage if something were to happen to her.

* I am not okay with this ending. He was *holding him*, goddammit! ;_;

* After credit scene! With Wrath! I didn't actualy know that would happen? Am I a secret genious?

* I was actually wondering for a second why Greed would go after Wrath instead of Father...but that's of course because Wrath killed his buddies. derp

I would say it's both Miles, and finally being able to see the fruit of his brother's research- remember, he saw his brother as wasting his life away all this time, and all this time, he only saw alchemy as causing destruction.

> Also subtle Russian imagery there FMA, real subtle.

There are tons of paralels between countries in FMA and in our world. Amestris is a combination of several countries from Europe - though it's closer to Germany in the 2003 anime. Xing, the  has features from some Asian countries, but mostly China. Now Drachma, the huge country of the North, is Russia.  
[Trivia](/s "There's also some country in the south that looks a bit like Italy and, on the west, Creta, that looks like...well, this is a bit weird but I'd say USA. Maybe UK. I think I'll watch the movie again soon an pay more attention to it.")
>> ARTICLE
Amestris is a really weird country: they speak Japanese, write in English but it feels like a WW1-era Germany with some WW2 technology (the tanks are really advanced for the era)

Yeah, I always imagined Amestris as a WW1-era Germany/Poland hybrid. The Xing=China is also rather obvious.

After two (three?) episodes without a hint of his status, the way Ed comes back is pretty fucking satisfying.

I've started to watch it 3 days ago. But I've already seen the 1st FMA anime. So I'm a bit spoiled for the sequel. Around when FMA:B will start to follow a new way (the way of the manga I presume). 
>> ARTICLE
It's good that you watched the 2003 anime already. Brotherhood rushed the beginning because they didn't want it to be too repetitive for old viewers.  
There's "a lot" of differences in the beginning, but from episode 15 onwards it should be almost 100% new content for you.

DO NOT skip any episode though. I've seen some people getting confused because of it.  
Also, get away from these discussion threads untill you catch up with them. Don't spoil this series for you, please.
>> ARTICLE
I'm already at the 17th. Not much differences before. But seems like it becomes interesting now. Thanks for the answer
>> ARTICLE
The day has come. Episode 15. Maybe I can find something that allows my theory to make sense again.

**Episode 15**

* Silver alchemists blood looks like poop, just sayin'
* New OP!
* New panda girl character introduced
* New Ninja guy introduced
* HUH? Scene in the OP shows Ed and his father looking at each other but he looks healthy and has no tubes attached to him? Was I wrong all along?
* Wait they are at the mothers grave by the looks of it so this definitely isn't a stylistic thing he is actually in good shape, so the who fuck is the Father then? He looks EXACTLY like him. 
* Are you ***seriously*** telling me MCs Dad has a [mustache twirling twin](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20061231030502/familyguy/images/9/92/Thadious.PNG)??? 
* We also see Ed having yet another encounter with Truth, wonder what crazy alchemy he is trying to pull this time
* In the same scene we also see a human hand reaching for him as he gets pulled away. Wondering who that is since his brother doesn't have a body, unless we're going to see Al get his body back?
* [Picture wall scene](http://i.imgur.com/9rVVAF9.png). I find it interesting how the Dads face is covered up. A metaphor for him not being a part of his families life?
* Now [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/5oP1Rec.png) scene is very interesting. That eye looks like the very same eye we see behind the doors in Truths dimension. That to me implies that the Sins were either created through human transmutation (connecting them to that eye thing) OR they were actually created by the eye thing itself and not either of the Fathers. 
* Who the hell is [this thing](http://i.imgur.com/QeOk4G2.png)? I'm guessing maybe the physical embodiment of that eye thing? I would say Pride but I don't see the connection between all the skulls and the feeling of pride so this must be a new player in the game. Potential mastermind behind Father and the sins? are they just puppets after all?
* Next scene show Father in the tube chair thing again. Guess that confirms that MCs Dad =/= Father
* Looks like Panda girl is infact an alchemist
* New Ninja guy fighting Wrath like a boss. That's both new characters confirmed good guys.
* Scar and Ed duking it out. What I find interesting is he straight up matches Scars destruction magic. He must learn how to counter it in this arc then.
* Annnnnnnnnd that is the new OP over. Lots of new stuff to interpret. The evil twin reveal thing caught me off guard. I need a new theory but since I don't know shit about Fathers back-story unlike I thought, it will be difficult to guess his motives.
* Woah Panda girl and Scar are on the same team?
* Panda girl has alchemy throwing knives *awwwwesome*
* And we're only 3 mins in and this is how much I've written
* So Scars destruction magic is powered by some eastern dragon shiz, is that why it didn't work on the sins with dragon marks?
* Oh man is Panda girl fantasizing about Ed?
* **Yep.**
* So Barry was made by the scientists and not the Sins. Interesting...so perhaps both Fathers are scientists and they had a disagreement on the ethical boundaries of alchemy?
* Oh man the subtlety in that Winry scene, with the bloodstained wrench in the background :D
* Wait I was just thinking, if the Fathers are brothers then how come one of them is aging but the other isn't? I mean it seems like Father sin is drinking blood in order to survive but Father Elric is perfectly healthy in the OP so what is the difference between the two? 
* Haha wouldn't it be ironic if Father Sin wants to be immortal and Father Elric wants to be mortal? I mean it's still possible that my theory last thread about Eds Dad still stands and it is clear Father sin doesn't want to die so it would be hilarious if that were true,  kinda like a greek tragedy thing
* Did anyone else see the Ninja dudes handkerchief? It had a panda on it just like the little girl!
* He even comes from the east too
* Ed giving us the run down of the different countries is pretty cool. Up until now we haven't really been given a detailed look at the world so 10/10
* Those Ninja henchmen have the coolest masks
* Did that Ninja just break a metal staff with string? Come on now...
* That Ninja has to be a chick given how many times Ed has said guy in the past 60 seconds
* **Yep.**
* Al didn't even need to use a circle! New MC confirmed
* I think we should start a count for everytime Eds automail has broke and they've gone back to Winry. Someone please tell me how many it's been so far!
* Xing Emperor wins the best new mustache award
* Who's betting that the panda girl is also royalty?
* **WINRY IS BACK!**
* ED seems alright. Not enough to make me watch it more the once though. Real shame but I think I'll be skipping both the OP and ED from now on :(

Wow that was just 1 episode. So much stuff to write about ;_;

**Episode 16**

* That car has killer eyebrows
* Love the fact that Barry is quickly becoming an awesome sidekick
* "I got a girlfriend!" ... "Hey, do you think I'd enjoy cutting her up?"
* Hughes ;_:
* What is up with that dudes lips?!? Everyone else just has the normal black line but his lips make him look like a $2 hooker
* Is that dude Envy's cover in the state buildings?
* **Yep.**
* *Tis but a scratch'*
* Damn that Gracia scene was pretty touching
* I think it's raining Winry ;_;
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH **LUST IS THAT GUYS NEW GIRLFRIEND** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
* It's nice to see Lust actually doing something relevant to her namesake now but wow I did not see that one coming

So much new juicy plot to digest. There was still nothing really in these episodes to tell us what Father Sins motives are. I can't wait to see Father Elric since it has been established he is not the bad guy we've been seeing. My current theory is that they were working on experiments together but I don't really know what to say other than that. I think if Father Elric was truly aware of what his brother was up to then we would of heard of him fighting the Sins by now so I don't think that was his motivation for leaving home. My best guess would have to be the whole mortal/immortal dynamic I mentioned earlier. If this new Ling guy believes the secret to immortality is somewhere in the capital then I guess Father Elric thought so too. Why he is still not in the capital is a mystery to me though. We heard from that shop person before that he was close to the Truth behind what he was looking for so what exactly he has been doing all these years should make for a good reveal. I hope we see him though, there has been so much teasing going on for his character that he has to show up really. I guess when Ed revisits his mothers grave like in the OP? Seems like that won't happen for awhile yet ;_;
>> ARTICLE
You can actually without the hint of a doubt guess what that thing in the OP with the many faces is, with just the stuff you know from the episodes so far and from context. I heard of people who did it accidentally. Even though it's in the OP it's still a spoiler, so [a small hint:](/s "that thing appeared in a row with the homunculus. Which homunculus have we met who did not appear in this montage of villain characters right before the chorus begins? It's a prominent one.")
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure I follow what you are saying. In the OP we don't see; Greed (Dead), Sloth (Alive) and Pride (who we haven't met yet). I don't think it's Pride because I do not really get the connection. So are you trying to say it's Sloth?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Well we saw Gluttony, Lust, Wrath and Envy, heck, we even saw Father so I don't know who else I'm missing.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
So Envy it is. I suppose that does make sense with the whole multiple face thing. Don't think I could of come to that conclusion by myself though since I was considering the part immediately following father to be part of the sequence. Meh.
>> ARTICLE
No thoughts on Maria getting arrested?
>> ARTICLE
Eh, don't really have much to say about it really. Seems like it has just been introduced as a learning experience for Mustang. I'm guessing he will believe she is guilty despite what everyone else says culminating in some stand off between him and either hawkeye, elric or Maria's partner. In the end he will either prove her innocent or she will die and that will disenfranchise him from the state government.

It'll be rough for the poor girl if she does wind up dead - she didn't really choose to get involved in all this.

I think you might be over-thinking your idea that Father is ill.  In the scene where Father melts down Greed and drinks that "blood," (as he says) he's actually drinking Greed himself to return him to his body.

>> ARTICLE
So he's not ill? huh. Wonder what all those tubes are designed for then.

I won't say whether he is or not.  I just wanted to clear up a misconception you had about that scene because otherwise you might be lost later on.

To be fair, OP2 is the weakest of the OPs.

Not really a fan of it to be honest. I might watch it if I think it is relevant to a theory I have but I just don't enjoy it compared to the last one.

I actually like the subs Lin because of that scene when he skips out on the bill at Rush Valley. The English dub of him pretending not to know the language wasn't as funny.

I'm sorry guys, I failed. I'm already on episode 20. I might stall to see if I can let this catch up, but I have a feeling that won't be happening.

Yeah, I started watching with ya'll but I got hooked again (4th or 5th time watching it) now I'm down to like episode 30.

Damn, even first timers are failing us and they don't even know what's coming up next
>> ARTICLE
We finally see rentanjutsu/Xing alchemy/alkehestry/purification arts (depending on the version you're watching) and the Xing people (including best waifu Lan Fan)

If episode 14 was not enough for people who saw the original version, this episode is the one that changes everything, Al can now use alchemy without circles, increasing his bad-ass level a ton, alkehestry is completely absent in the original version and same goes to all the Xing characters (meaning FMA 2003 doesn't have best waifu Lan Fan therefore it's pure shit)

Winry joins the team again, sadly she learns bad news very soon so the emotional roller coaster begins right now, get ready first timers because these next episodes go from fun jokes to "good god, why is it so rainy in my house?" in seconds

I was just thinking about how Scar stops at deconstruction, thus causing devastating damage. Why don't more alchemists do this? Ed used it to great effect on the guy from the fifth laboratory, so why don't we see more people using it if it's so effective? 
>> ARTICLE
It requires the proper circles and being in close range while alchemy can be very powerful from very far, Ed and Al don't need circles so they can use this without too much problems, Scar... well I won't spoil it, other characters would need to have the respective circle to allow this and this could change with certain materials so they would need multiple circles to allow so many uses of the same type of alchemy

>> ARTICLE
i thought he didnt need to use alchemy circles

They explain it later in the series so a little bit of spoilers here, [Spoiler](/s "alchemy in FMA:B requires a circle and construction symbols (which are normally drawn within or on the circle) After traveling through the gate and seeing the truth, Edward and his teacher, and later in the series Al as well, are able to understand the way of making a circle with their body (their hands clapped together) and using themselves as construction symbols or manipulating their own energy into construction symbols basically allowing them to perform a wide variety of alchemy on demand with no need to have a physical alchemy circle on them or drawn on something in their environment.")

maybe it's etched onto his automail

did you watch the series?

[i think big spoilers, cant remember, just play it safe and dont hover:](/s "nono, i believe he doesnt need a circle because of the whole gate of truth thing, because he visited it he doesn't need to anymore, like his teacher ")
>> ARTICLE
No, first time viewer.
>> ARTICLE
:D Don't look at any of the spoiler text man.  It may be hard, but this show's twists are some of its better points.
>> ARTICLE
Think of alchemy in FMA as a electrical circuit. It won't work unless the circuit is complete IE it's an unbroken track that the energy flows along. When Ed  puts hands hands together it like he's completing the circuit. They either explain it later in FMAB or somewhere in FMA. The reason for this is because he went through the gate. [Just in case](/s "Both Ed and his brother are quoted in saying they saw "the truth" when going through it but then neither remember it. I believe that part of the truth is using alchemy without the circles. Ed and Izumi both use alchemy without circles subconsciously") 
>> ARTICLE
yeah, that proves my point right? theyre not using an transmutation circle at all
>> ARTICLE
technically yes but the concept isn't gone.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely remember some episode of FMA or FMA:B where another character notes that [major spoiler](/s "when he puts his hands together he completes the circuit that normally requires a Transmutation Circle. The question then becomes: How is the 'circuit' completed in those that don't have to make any physical motions at all? I'd say it is always connected and flowing as their bodies are Philosopher's Stones. The obvious ones, but also things like Greed's hardening ability.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "I just remembered now that it was Von Hohenheim who explained how it works. But the power of alchemy is in everyone, and they get their power from the other side of the gate. This disproves your "every one is a philosophers stone", unless you are getting it confused with Hohenheim who is literally a living stone. Think of the alchemist as a power source, a battery to a circuit. When the alchemist connects themselves to the circle they can "power" it and focus the energy to undergo the three stages using the circle. There are also different circles for different tasks, for example the Grand Arcanum is used for making a stone. After going through the gate and witnessing the truth and subconsciously holding it, it allows the alchemist to focus their energy without an array. This is what allows, some characters depend on which version you are watching, Ed, Al, Izumi, and Dante to transmute without circles. ")
>> ARTICLE
[giant spoilers](/s "Fascinating about Hohenheim and the other side of the gate. I didn't mean that everyone is a Philosopher's Stone. I meant that Hohenheim and Father as a living collections of stones and other homunculi (who's bodies vary largely but are still the embodiment of one or multiple stones) can transmute with no circle at all, which I'm assuming is an inherent property of their inner workings as stone-based-lifeforms :).")
>> ARTICLE
Oh ok :P [Spoiler] (/s "Just to clarify no homunculus can use alchemy") [Original FMA spoiler] (/s "The only reason why Wrath could transmute in FMA was because he has Ed's arm. Giving him a human part allowing him to channel the energy :)")

He doesn't distinguish anime from cartoons but he doesn't have that view that just children can watch it. He would watch pokemon sometimes if he's bored.

There was so much foreshadowing in this episode. 

[Foreshadowing in the episode, SPOILERS](/s ""Eastern form of alchemy", "The legendary stone that destroyed Xerxes overnight", all of the stuff about Ishbal and "seeing hell", the stuff about Winry's parents, "That thing wasn't human" Ed can now use alchemy without Transmutation Circles, "just like teacher"")


>> ARTICLE
Indeed. [Massive SPOILERS](/s "Like the animation at the beginning, showing that the red stone is made out of people.")
>> ARTICLE
That's less foreshadowing and more 'blatant spoiler'
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's like all the OPs for Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei. If you look at it without any knowledge of the plot they're just weird and crazy imagery, but if you know the plot you realize that they're all containing massive spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
If I remember right in the attack on Titan opening it shows [AoT spoilers](/s "the manga page with eren getting eaten")
>> ARTICLE
That hasn't even happened in the manga yet.
>> ARTICLE
It definitely happened. In the anime it was episode 5, and in the manga it was in chapter 4.

My bad, I thought you were talking about[latest manga chapter spoiler](/s "Historia Reiss' father forcing her to eat Eren so she can get his power").

If you say he got swallowed maybe there's less confusion.

Especially if you're anticipating what's to come in the next chapter(s)

Yes that's what I thought he was talking about.

I don't know about the manga but it definitely happened in the anime

I guess it is, but it is a pretty far fetch for those who haven't seen the series.

This episode always makes me cry. They're just little boys who want their mother back, they had no idea just how severe the consequences were for what they were about to do.

Again by Yui is easily my favourite theme song ever.
>> ARTICLE
Akira Senju's soundtrack definitely helps a ton. 

[Its so fucking good](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml-jhHJA7s0)

It's a far cry from the standard "sad OST" that has a solo piano and maybe some generic strings thrown in (SAO I'm looking at you)

Edit: SAO soundtrack was very good, but some of the more emotional music was kind of lacking imho. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit I didnt know there was a rewatch of this going on, this will be my chance to finally watch this.
>> ARTICLE
You'll see me here on every episode, so start getting used to it.

Did I already mention the awesome opening? song and animation are very neat, I like it.

Nothing to say about the storyline. perfect flashback, not too rushed, not too slow. People immediately get hooked. Especially the scene with god and ed was made very well.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/hYzFwgR.png) is my favourite shot of this episode. Love's a tricky thing isnt it?
>> ARTICLE
I personally love the song for the ED. It has a melancholic feel to it that bodes well and bad at the same time.

I never knew the opening was SO GOOD! I think I must have skipped through it the first time around. Wow!

>> ARTICLE
Wow. This show is just going to get better and better. I loved the serious tone this episode had and then the one lighthearted scene with Fuhrer Bradley walking away with the "ha has" had me laughing. Also the desperation of Edward to bring his brother back had me in tears, and the scene with Alphonse repeatedly saying "We're sorry" almost made me cry. It just pains me how we're only watching an episode a day.

Awesome OP. Awesome ED. Awesome Characters. Awesome Storyline.
Awesome EVERYTHING.

Wow I really liked this episode a lot. But it definitely helps to have watched FMA first. This episode got so much out of the way I'm kind of excited to see where this shows story is going to end up. And Ed's leg getting transferred to the "other" seems like its going to be important down the road. 
>> ARTICLE
Great Episode.
>> ARTICLE
I'm new to the series and I've been wondering, I noticed how Ed seems to have gained a lot of information from sacrificing his leg, but I'm surprised he didn't ask or think if Al gained something from selling away his entire body. The Law of Equivalent Exchange right? Is that something I will find out in the future, or am I missing something from watching the first two episodes only?
>> ARTICLE
You will find out a bit more regarding what Al knows later on, as I recall. It may not answer all your questions though. 
>> ARTICLE
Can you guys move the rewatch discussion threads to the FMA subreddit? A daily discussion thread seems rather obnoxious, for lack of a better term. 
>> ARTICLE
It's too late for that now, ain't it. And I doubt that one post will make this subreddit less clean or whatever. :P
>> ARTICLE
Damn, the reddit police really cracked down on me hard.

I wasn't saying that as a knock against the show that you're discussing, but wouldn't it fit better in the subreddit designed for FMA?
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily. This subreddit has discussions of every episode of popular anime. Just because it has its own subreddit doesn't mean we have to put every content related to it in the subreddit. FMA is an anime too so it very much fits here. Sorry if I sounded a harsh, I just wanted to share my thoughts

Edit: changed opinions to thoughts
>> ARTICLE
>Would it belong in /r/fullmetalalchemist? 

Sure. 

>Does it belong in /r/anime? 

Absolutely, this is a subreddit for discussing anime. 

There have been many daily rewatch threads in the past, and a few are still going on. I really don't see the problem with rewatching it here. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, fair enough. I see your point.
>> ARTICLE
Ok so now we are getting close to Episode 15 which is where most people say the show really kicks it up a gear. Should be fun. No new theories yet but that might change after I've watched these two episodes.

**Episode 13**

* Still not sick of the OP, I love it to death
* I wonder if Al actually gained more knowledge from Truth since he traded more of his body than Ed did. Granted it was for the human transmutation but it's something to think about.
* Wow Ed literally just said the same thing *we are so in touch*
* Err did this just into a tentacle hentai
*  Wonder who the ratman is...
* Chess man also has a killer mustache
* "I just recently found a girlfriend" - Dudes got his priorities straight
* "Break up with her" haha
* Scar is riiiiiiipped
* We've been seeing pictures of Mr.Yoki everywhere, guess he is finally showing up
* Woah Scar just destroyed that dudes hand without even looking
* He's too bad ass for his own good. Shame he killed mustache dude, I would've liked him otherwise.
* Don't take candy from strangers either, Al.
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOH Greed has shown up too. Let's see if he confirms it.
* Awww the transition screens ruined it :( Greed confirmed.
* Oh well he said it straight up right after. Not such a shame then.
* Thought he said he was hummus then...

> A homunculus (Latin for "little man", plural: "homunculi"; from the masculine diminutive form of homo, "man") is a representation of a small human being. Popularized in sixteenth century alchemy and nineteenth century fiction, it has historically referred to the creation of a miniature, fully formed human.

* Guess that confirms that the Sins were created rather than born or otherwise
* The fact that Greed regenerated after having his head taken off pretty much confirms that you need to destroy the mark to kill a Sin
* So many boxes are being ticked this episode 
* Wuuuuuuuuuuuuut he's been alive for 200 years? If he was made at the same time as the other sins then that must mean that MCs Dad is immortal but then that also means that he didn't go to the capital to do human transmutation so there goes my entire theory. If he didn't go to the capital to experiment and created the Sins before the events of the series then I don't see how my 'descending into madness' plotline makes sense. He looked at least sane when he left home so \_(-_-)_/
* I wonder if the designs of the marks have any particular meaning. Greed has a dragon but I don't know what they could really be referring to
* If Greed doesn't know what the other Sins are up to then he must not be on good terms with them/father?
* Eds rant was suitably epic
* wow Greeds clap...no fucks given
* Hmm if Greed can make his sign metal then I'm not sure how he can be destroyed. Maybe you just need to sever the mark from the brain? e.g. cut off his arm while his head is intact
* Oh yeah forgot he can go full metal, unlike the fullmetal alchemist
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH I think it just clicked. Can he be killed with Scars deconstruction magic?
* Wait wtf did Ed just do then?
* Well looks like Ed is secretly Einstein
* " A PASSING...HOUSEWIFE"

Man all the characters in this arc are really growing on me. Greed for best Sin!

**Episode 14**

* HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLY SHIT **I think I just realized what Eds Dad was so obsessed about**. He didn't given a shit about human transmutation. He wanted to be able to make people immortal! We established last episode that he is immortal himself since he made the Sins over 200 years ago. The thing is as we've seen, Ed, Al and his wife all age! So what if he wanted to make them immortal so he wouldn't have to watch them die while he never ages! What if he created the Sins as a side product of his experiments into immortality? He realized his mistake after it had happened so he vowed not to do it again but once he settled down and had kids he realized that he would have to watch them die, so he started the experiments again but couldn't find the answer and that was what drove him insane! I think this works because that way it still fits into my last theory while accommodating the new info we now have.  I really hope I'm right here.
* [Look at the symmetry](http://i.imgur.com/a95000q.png) of the capital! Some Architect is sitting on a pile of money right now.
* Woah didn't expect the Fuhrer to show up in the south. Maybe he is after Greed if they are not on good terms?
* Greed doesn't even know who the Fuhrer is? Was I wrong about him being a Sin?
* Also the Fuhrer is only 60 not 200...he could just be lying though, dude had some major strength in that fight
* Oh man that scene where the Major sculpts his body into the other dudes hammer was class
* **OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH** ***HE HAS A MARK***, UNDERNEATH THE EYE-PATCH ***HE HAS A MARK***, **FUCK YEAH**
* [Oh now he is definitely Wrath!](http://i.imgur.com/9rOQWQf.png) I was close :(

> Define 'Badass'

> 
> 2.Distinctively tough or powerful; so exceptional as to be intimidating.
> 
> 3.The Fuhrer-President, otherwise know as Wrath

* Man, imagine how horrible it must feel to have someone literally die **INSIDE** of you
* Looks like Master knows whats up
* Oh yeah, I forgot they don't know Hughes died...
* Did [**this**](http://i.imgur.com/NHvSbIT.jpg) stand out to anyone else? That scene has to be intentional, I mean of all the angles they could have shown us of the city they show us it centered, with the street lights on the important lines...
* Looks like I was right about the alchemists being sacrifices. What I don't get is why would they sacrifice one of the brothers? If they share the same Father then why would he want to kill one of his sons?
* Sloth is revealed! He looks pretty buff for a Sloth though, plus the Sloth is 'busy'? Doesn't really live up to the name does he? Now we only have Pride left to see.
* Wait Father has aged since Greed last saw him? I thought he was immortal? 
* Unless I was wrong all along...what if he actually wanted to be mortal? What if he wanted to age and die with his wife and kids? He has found a way to die but it involves whatever it is those tubes are and however many sacrifices he plans on making. Maybe he actually wanted to be immortal at one point and became immortal at the same he created the Sins, yet once he had a family he wanted to be mortal again! The only thing I don't understand is that he created Wrath after the fact but before he met his family...what was the purpose behind Wrath's creation? Fuck my brains hurts again...is he even MCs Dad?? I really don't get what his motives are anymore. He seemingly created the Sins on purpose but then abandoned them to start a family and then started using them again to become mortal and die? The fuck? I wish MCs Dad had an [evil mustache twirling twin](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20061231030502/familyguy/images/9/92/Thadious.PNG) or something so this plot can actually make sense for once. 
* R.I.P Greed you will always be remember as the best Sin, guess Scar wasn't necessary after all
* Also Father wins worst parent of the year award
* I wonder if the Fuhrers family gets killed sending him into full Wrath mode, that would seriously be a sight to see.


Welp that is it for this thread. Consider me confused. I thought I had a really solid theory but apart from the Character reveals I still don't have a single clue what the whole master plan is and what the Father is actually trying to do. On one hand his motives seem to be done with some good intent but then on the other hand he is just like 'Mwuhahaha fuck it, I'm evil'. 
>> ARTICLE
If it makes you feel any better in the 2003 anime the Fuhrer is Pride, although nowhere as badass as here
>> ARTICLE
Really? That's pretty cool. So does Pride in this anime become Wrath in the 2003 version?
>> ARTICLE
Wrath is anime original in the 2003 version and it's a very hated character
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like the 2003 anime is Fullmetal's version of DEENs Fate/Stay night
>> ARTICLE
I like both. Brotherhood though is much much better, and way more epic. But the 2003 anime got me to read the manga and it hooked me.
>> ARTICLE
How many issues does the manga have? I'm thinking of getting it after this series is over.

Edit: Thanks for the simultaneous answers guys  *you are so in touch*
>> ARTICLE
27 Volumes if I'm not mistaken.
>> ARTICLE
108 (with the last issue being expanded in the show and that issue was very big already, it was almost 3 issues in one)
>> ARTICLE
Not that bad, it's actually good but it has plenty of things that make me prefer Brotherhood and it takes itself way too seriously (just a small example: remember in episode 3 when Ed tells Rose the ingredients to make a human, well in Brotherhood Rose looked confused with so many ingredients, in FMA 2003 she looks super serious and dramatic music plays in the background)

Some things: 

* the first 30 episodes are better than the first 10 episodes in Brotherhood, Nina's and Hughes' deaths are sadder because you spend more with those characters, but unlike Brotherhood where their deaths become a recurring theme and change some characters, they are kinda forgotten (Ed doesn't learn about Hughes' death until near the end)
* I find the main villain of FMA 2003 very pathetic, at least when you compare it to Father
* while the first 30 episodes of FMA 2003 have a ton of fantasy, this is kinda dropped when the anime goes full original story and becomes more grounded in reality, creating a huge contrast in tone 

The biggest problem I have with FMA 2003 is Al and Winry and the fact that the movie is a must if you want anything close to an ending, Winry is a forgotten character while for Al... well... he has **one** moment in the entire show and his entire personality is based on the one moment where he doubted himself after he and Ed went to the 5th laboratory where in Brotherhood he's probably a better character than Ed

Sorry if this is too negative, the show is actually the reason I started to read the manga, it's still pretty good and it's fairly high in MAL (around 150th place IIRC) but it clearly was nowhere as well though as the Manga and Brotherhood where even the openings have a ton of though behind them
>> ARTICLE

>  Winry is a forgotten character while for Al... well... he has one moment in the entire show and his entire personality is based on the one moment where he doubted himself after he and Ed went to the 5th laboratory where in Brotherhood he's probably a better character than Ed

Interstingly, in the first anime, Al spent a whole episode moping around from that. In Brotherhood, Winry fixed the situation instantly.
>> ARTICLE
Wow thanks for the insight! I might end up watching it at some point to see the contrast between the three. I'll probably do it in this order to get the best possible experience; Brotherhood>Manga>Fullmetal (2003)

> where even the openings have a ton of though behind them
> 

Totally agree with that. Most of my theories have stemmed from what is shown in the OP. You know an opening is well designed when it gives you whole new perspective on what you are watching without actually outright spoiling anything.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think these 2 episodes changed your theory very much, most of your points still stand, with perhaps only a few things that don't work anymore.

>I wish MCs Dad had an [evil mustache twirling twin](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20061231030502/familyguy/images/9/92/Thadious.PNG)  

Now I'm imagining Father with such a mustache just doing an evil laugh.

Oh and [major spoilers](/s "the evil twin statement really made me laugh for how true it is.")
>> ARTICLE
Your speculation is about as impressive as it could possibly be at this point in the series! Once it's over, you should go back through these posts just to check where you came close to picking what's coming.

Will do! I'm absolutely gutted that I got the pride thing wrong :(
>> ARTICLE
[2003 FMA Spoilers](/s he's pride in the original anime)
>> ARTICLE
Hah, it's still a pretty damn good guess, and you even narrowed him down to Pride or Wrath, and merely said that Pride seemed a bit more likely.
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait for /u/rascorpia post today since we finally learn that the sins are homunculus, we see their insane regen, we see Greed, Wrath and a glimpse of Father and Sloth

Finally we are completely separated from the 2003 anime and Al remembering the Truth is what makes this version of Al way superior to the 2003 version

He must be. We saw a full on shot of him in episode 1 and I compared it to the pictures of him in the opening and it's exactly the same. I don't really know what changed him from being a loving father to a evil maniac though.

*Maybe....* he was never a loving father to begin with! 
>> ARTICLE
Well when we saw him leaving home last thread he definitely didn't look sad to see his sons go, heck, he didn't even say goodbye so maybe you're right. I was thinking he was just acting cold to distance himself though so it could swing either way. That said him being evil from the get-go would help things make more sense.

His wife seemed to love him, so he at least pretended to be a good father.

As a fellow first time watcher, I would say yeah it looks like Hohenheim, but looks can be decieving so I'm going to say its not actually him.

The whole battle between Wrath and Greed was just so good to look at.
I really like the fighting scenes in this anime, also the heavy hitters Armstrong and Roa was just a pleasure to look at.

Also the reveal of Bradley as Wrath puts some of his speeches into perspective.

What speeches are you referring to? I don't think I picked up on that.

Remember, just before Hughes' death Bradley showed up to Ed's hospital room and gave a speech about enemies in the military?  If you review what he said you will find some pretty telling plot details tucked away.

>> ARTICLE
> From here onward. People that are watching for the first time won't be able to resist at all to continue at this pace, unless they don't have time.

I really don't have the time :D

**Episode 21**

* Infighting with the Sins, wonder what Fathers reaction is
* Hmmm they are wanting to use Mustang to open something...what could that be...
* That's one nut job theory on how Ed+Al are connected and that is coming from me.
* At around 4:50 in we see a close up of the door we saw last thread. I put the latin through google translate and came up with this;

> "Father of three generations is the creator and redeemer filtvs Mediator" 

* Now this seems to be a VERY rough translation but hey, that is google translate for you. I did a quick search and it came up with a lot of bible references specifically referencing Jesus. From what I can interpret from this statement it seems to be stating that the 'Father created the redeemer and the mediator'. Considering we know of two Fathers, both with their own offspring I think it is trying to say that they (or simply one of them) is the key component to the alchemy on the door. 
* I doubt the Sins are components though since it is established that they were created rather than born and they don't really fit the idea of 'redeemer & mediator' as perfectly as Ed+Al do. Ed is searching for a way to recover his brothers body after his failed alchemy= Redemption. Al is constantly trying to get along with people as evidence by his love of animals and his statement last episode "Geez...you and brother always get mad before I ever can, so I never get to" = Mediator. 
* As for the other components on the door we see the Sun and what I can only presume is the Moon as well. That certainly points towards the alchemy circle requiring a solar eclipse to be taking place for it to work
* We can also see the central circle surrounded by fire, I think this is what Wrath meant when he said Mustang could be useful to open something
* Finally we have the three circles below the central one. I'm thinking this is pointing towards groups of people but I can't really think what the third one would be. We've got 1) Alchemists, 2) General Population, maybe 3) is homunculus? I'm not sure.
* I'll check back on this once the episodes are over to see if I've missed anything. Feel free point anything out about this that I haven't talked about!
* Jean lost his legs :( not gonna get automail? I understand it takes time to adjust but you're not gonna get a new girlfriend just sitting around
* Oh he can't get automail. I should really stop doing that...
* Using the Philosophers stone seems dangerous to me
* Hmm Ed+Al seem to be saying that the reason they are ideal sacrifices is because they have been through that gate thing and returned alive. Is this just a case of unreliable narrator? I mean that might factor into it but I think there is more to it than just that, otherwise the Sins would hunt down people like master too.
* Oh man Ed+Al vs Scar round two is coming
* I'm just gonna list it now for your entertainment rewatchers. These are the Characters that I don't want to see die; Ed, Al, Winry, Major, Hawkeye, Maria, Gracia and Elicia. If there is a name missing then it is probably because I would be content with them dying so long as it was a badass death.
* [Haha](http://i.imgur.com/wO3WTnr.png) even Ed knows he's gonna need Winry after fighting Scar
* Mustang is a true bro
* O_o What is with the sudden change in animation.
* Now [this is just](http://i.imgur.com/z3YL69i.png) scary
* I get the feeling like all this bait thing is going to do is bring out Wrath, which they can't really do anything against yet without bringing down the state on them
* ooooh looks like now is when we will see Ling fight Wrath on that catwalk thing

**Episode 22**

* LING IS PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISED
* Ling+Ran Fan is another ship?
* Now this is too epic
* Winry ;_;
* Hughes ;_;
* Nina ;_;
* Rockbells ;_;
* *Screw this show*
* nononononono
* Scar if you kill Winry I will pull a Log Horizon or something and hunt your ass down
* I'm kind of surprised all the state alchemists went along with this war. It's so brutal, like no one stopped and said 'Hey I'm shooting a kid'
* There is that alchemist we saw in prison. Can't wait for his showdown with Scar
* His brother lived through that? Looks he tried to use reconstruction magic...is that how he dies? Human transmutation would be the best bet since he was trying to get his family back
* Holy shit that was brutal
* Anyone notice the cat that got flung into the air? :D
* Give Winry a break, christ...
* Putting new meaning in 'Let it all out'

I am getting the distinct feeling that Eds redemption is tied into Scars as well. Not sure how it will play it from here but I don't see Scar dying before he teams up with the Elrics. It might even be the case that Winry is the one to bring them together, if they go down the route. I don't think episode 22 revealed anything more about the door but feel free to point anything out. My fullmetal purchases should come on Tuesday so I'm hyped as fuck :D

Automail's not gonna help. It's not his legs that got incapacitated, but the nerve connections to the legs.

No worries! I know it can be awkward dodging around spoilers sometimes.

> I really don't have the time :D

The first time it's a good thing you don't have the time to watch more episodes :)

>We can also see the central circle surrounded by fire, I think this is what Wrath meant when he said Mustang could be useful to open something

Not really sure if this is really a spoiler, but Im gonna tag it just to be sure [about Mustang's fire alchemy](/s "Mustang is the only alchemist who can use fire alchemy if I recall it correctly, at least on a large scale")

>Hmm Ed+Al seem to be saying that the reason they are ideal sacrifices is because they have been through that gate thing and returned alive. Is this just a case of unreliable narrator? I mean that might factor into it but I think there is more to it than just that, otherwise the Sins would hunt down people like master too.

Ed and Al are doing the same thing you're doing at the moment, trying to figure out what is going on, but with less information, so yes, you could call this a case of unreliable narrator.

About master, do the Sins even know that Master has been through the gate thing, she does keep this a secret.

>Ed, Al, Winry, Major, Hawkeye, Maria, Gracia and Elicia

No love for Mustang or Ling? :(

>I'm kind of surprised all the state alchemists went along with this war. It's so brutal, like no one stopped and said 'Hey I'm shooting a kid'

You'll get a lot more information on the war in later episodes, so you'll just have to wait till those episodes for the answers to these questions.

You really should read back on these posts once you have completed the show just to see how good or bad your theories were.

Fixed

To be fair, your later theories are better than your first ones, and I'm sure they'll only improve the closer we'll get to the end. At least they continue to entertain everyone here who has already watched the show :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh, so you decided to read the symbolism behind the circles, you are going the right way, there's a ton of stuff behind each transmutation circle in the show, back in the manga days there were people with very detailed posts explaining what they meant
>> ARTICLE
Well this is the first alchemy circle I've really got to see in detail and it seems like an important one so you can bet I'm gonna put my theory hat on.

Nothing really to say before the write up today so lets just dive straight into it!

**Episode 39**

* Huh? New OP? Barely feels like it's been two episodes since the last one. Shows how fast we are getting through the series now. Kind of scary to think this show will be over by the end of the week.
* Surprisingly little to say to say about the new OP. Simply put, we are going to see fights with the Sins from this point out. Also Hohenheim is going back to the capital, not sure why though. 
* One thing that did stand out to me was how the gate of truth crumbled apart at the end of the OP. It might not mean anything but if we are going to see it destroyed then consider me hyped.
* Probably 3rd best OP soundwise. Kono omoi wo should have just been remixed for each new OP :D
* Figured the explosion would be part of the plan
*  Al has matured since the beginning of the show. His speech to the chimeras is a nice reflection of the fight with Barry (R.I.P) at the prison 
* They were surprisingly trusting. I was with Miles on killing them. 
* Scar redemption arc is happening!
* What is it with black people having really weird lips in this show? They are like yellow it's bizarre. 
* Oh no, looks like Al's soul is beginning to reject his current body. I'm honestly shocked it has lasted this long though. An arm for almost a decades worth of time is a pretty good deal IMO.
* WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH HOLD UP. What the hell is Father planning. He has 4 sacrifices lined up for his little circle thing and they all seem to involve people who have seen the gate of truth. Is it possible he is trying to make a humunculus of Truth like he attempted with Gluttony but with, well, better ingredients?
* This ED is funky as all hell
* Definitely still intrigued by Hawkeye's back markings. Could she be the 5th piece that Father is looking for? I'm thinking that her Father (Mustangs Tutor) also encountered Truth and somehow burnt his revelations into his Daughters back. It's obvious she has some sort of scarring so it's not too much of a stretch to assume they are burn marks. Also his poor health while teaching Mustang could be attributed to missing organs like with Master Izumi. There has to be a connection here and this is my best guess so far.
* There is also a lion & monkey chimera that I don't think we have met yet (or at least not revealed). 
* Some hand holding going on at the very end there. Hohenheim and a young Ed? Glowing must means something was transferred to the little guy

**Episode 40**

* If Hawkeye didn't exist I would definitely be shipping Mustang+Satsuki
* "Both your wallet and you balls are pea-sized, I see" DAYYYYYYYYYUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMM. You'd need to go to the Northern Briggs Wall just to cool off from that burn.
* Satsuki is really making every other character so far look bad. She knows exactly how to play the game.
* Title Episode "The dwarf in the Flask". Major General=Satsuki=Tyrion Lannister 
* Captain Buccanner...have we met this character yet? I don't think so
* Woah are we getting a Hohenheim flashback? Hype levels are rising.
* So he created Pride and not Father??? Did I take the blue pill and not the red pill?
* So was Hohenheim special before he created Pride? Who exactly is his master? Who did the original experiments? Is he a slave of Xerxes? How does Pride have this knowledge? 
* So it was Pride that sacrificed the people of Xerxes and not Hohenheim or Father? Is Father just a puppet of Pride? 
* So at some point Hohenheim achieves the immortality that the kind chased. By Prides design or by accident?
* This must be also why Hohenheim makes an effort to remember all the names of those in Philosophers stone, because unlike with the Sins he didn't intend for these people to die for his immortality
* Wait is that maybe Father & not Pride? The whole black creature with the eye thing was throwing me off but now it makes more sense
* So my theories before about Xerxes weren't too far off. Except Hohenheim wasn't experimenting himself he was just a victim of circumstance I suppose. I'm so confused about Fathers creation though. How was he made? Who had the knowledge to make him? How does Father have such intricate knowledge on things? 
* I wonder just how powerful Hohenheim is then if he can harness the power of a nation inside his philosophers stone.
* So he can move organs just like that. No biggie. 
* Probably actually a bad thing that Izumi lives longer if she is a target for Fathers sacrificial shiz
* Well that episode messed with my brain considerably. Now I feel like an innocent child who knows nothing of the world. My theories were so close yet so far arrggghhh
* After credits scene; Ah Ed you have know idea!

**Episode 41** 

* Stop being an idealist Ed, listen to Miles
* Miles is more like Scar than he lets on
* Ah Winry you are so close!
* Woops. Even I forgot about Al
* Where the hell did Ed get a perfect replica of Al's armour in an abandoned mining village? Did he make it with alchemy?
* Starting to get a little worried that Miles will die here. I already know Kimblee won't because he was fighting those tanks in the OP and I get the feeling Scar would at least be involved in his death considering their past. Please don't kill Miles :( 
* Lion & Monkey! Wonder if they will be turncoats or not
* Who the fuck knows what constitutes dynamite off by heart
* Doesn't Kimblee keep a Philosophers stone in his mouth? Don't think it matters that you threw that one away Ed
* **Yep.**
* Miles was right you dumbass. If he dies because of you...
* Now would be a pretty good time for Ed to learn eastern alchemy. That or have MayMay show up
* "I'm going to seal the wound" - You'll never be as manly as mustang searing his wounds to close them
* Can't wait to see that spare Philosophers stone be reincorporated. Maybe they can use to make Kimblee OD on the stuff?

So much has happened and so much is going to happen. I thought I knew what was going to happen and now I have no clue. All I can do is sit back and watch the world burn.

Future prediction: *Stuff. Stuff is going to happen.*
>> ARTICLE
> If Hawkeye didn't exist I would definitely be shipping Mustang+Satsuki

I think there's a good case to be made that Olivier is actually somewhat attracted to Mustang, knows he isn't interested in anyone except Hawkeye, and is a bit grumpy about it.
>> ARTICLE
> almost a decades worth of time

It's been around 3, 4 years since the loss of their bodies
>> ARTICLE
> Definitely still intrigued by Hawkeye's back markings.

I'm not sure if this was already said or if it still has to come, but[possibly small spoilers, nothing major](/s "Her tattoos are everything her father discovered about fire alchemy in his lifetime. He tattood it on his daughters back to make sure it wasn't lost when he died. Mustang later learned everything he could from those tattoos and burned them to make sure nobody else could learn about fire alchemy")

>Captain Buccanner...have we met this character yet? I don't think so

He is the one with the giant automail arm.

About Fathers creation. Again, I don't think they explain more, but I will just put it in spoilers to be certain. [fathers creation](/s "The alchemists of Xerxes used the blood of slave 23 to create the first homunculus from a small part of "the truth". Because of this, he still held some of that knowledge, including how to make a philosophers stone. The king of Xerxes wanted this to become immortal. The homunculus then used the alchemical circle to sacrifice everyone in Xerxes so he could create a body for himself, in essence one giant philosophers stone. He gifted half those souls to Van Hohenheim, so he became immortal too")
>> ARTICLE
Further info on Hawkeye's back is still to come in later episodes.
>> ARTICLE
> Who the fuck knows what constitutes dynamite off by heart

This was probably my biggest humurous "wtf" moment so far. It's all so deadly serious and than they suddenly list off all the compounds of dynamite. Like...what? how? why?
>> ARTICLE
>Captain Buccanner...have we met this character yet? I don't think so

He's the big guy from Briggs with the claw automail.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes. Didn't make the connection for whatever reason. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
> Future prediction: Stuff. Stuff is going to happen.

You nailed it, how did you guess?
>> ARTICLE
I went through the gate of truth to bring you that prediction. 
>> ARTICLE
Guess who's early today. I had so much fun with these write ups that I  prepared :D

**Episode 39**

* New OP! ....eh, number 5 is better.

* Doesn't seem to spoil much... gonna skip this one from now on.

* (Is winry actually unconcious? she's looking rather ragdolly)

* Goddamn why is Winry such a good character.

* "Wait a minute, non-aggresive postive reinforcement? I hadn't even thought of that!"-Scar

* "Dr. Marco! You're looking worse by the minute"

* Ed's face @ 8:30. He looks like a frog.

* The chimearaguys still CAN look normal if they want to, right? What IS the problem for them?

* Yoki's only useful moment in this entire show.

* "Yes, I want him to kidnap me. I'm into that"

* Ed she's literally giving you MULTIPLE rings please get the message

* Rockbell papa/mama confirmed for best dead people. Besides Thrisha. And Hughes. And Nina. And Scar's Brother. And (etc)

* How old is may/Mei (?) anyway? like...8?

* Marco you're not holding Wikipedia in your hand it's just a notebook. It's not going to cause world peace.

* Al saving the day. (Why is he breathing so badly? he has no lungs. On that note, how does he talk?)

* ALBODY WAIT DON'T STEP INTO THE LIGHT OH GOD AL WHAT'S GOING ON

* op sucked, but this IS one of my favourite ED's. Spoilery though.

**Episode 40**

* lol, Mustang still getting rid of his flowers.

* Olivier's a dick. But goddamn is she good at this.

* dat morse code action

* [LARGE SPOILER](/s "actually kinda funny considering Pride KNOWS morse")

* oh god this is THIS episode.

* Hohenheim and homunculus, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g

* what would happen if he just knocked over that flask?

* oh boi here we go

* I love it when this music plays

* well /u/rascorpia. there you have it. Hope you enjoyed your theorycraft

* Hey remember all those names from episode 36?

* anyone fancy a cup of nightmare fuel?

* oh lol it was actually a dream. also hi izumi

* Hohenheim wtf is u doing. 

* dat reveal. dang.

* after credit scene! Ed making the good remarks. Just how powerful is hohenheim

* I never pay attention to these but I just love how the announcer pronounced the next episodes title in the dub. *"the abyzz"*

**Episode 41**

* I suddenly feel like playing minecraft

* surely that dynamite won't be important later

* Dat subtle reveal about xing alchemie (alcahestry?)

* Why do I get the feeling that Ed is going to do something stupid.

* Ed I blame you for this

* Oh hey more chimearapeople.

* I love how they just casually list of all their chemical knowledge

* OOOOOH HE FUCKED UP HIS CIRCLE

* Ed no ;_;

* Al no ;_;

* All chimearapeople are pretty okay. Zampano, Hansel...Gorilla, frog...Nina... Nina ;-;

* This part fucked me up pretty bad on my first watch. Ed's lifespan decreased to...50?

* Chimearapeople confirmed for best secondary characters?

* This ED is so good. Not a good fit for that ending though.

Op 4 is personally one of my favorites of all anime openings, but it had to grow on me, didnt like it at first
>> ARTICLE
> The chimearaguys still CAN look normal if they want to, right? What IS the problem for them?

That they can also look like freaks.

>Yoki's only useful moment in this entire show.

From a corrupt owner to everyone's chew toy. He sure did fall hard.

>How old is may/Mei (?) anyway? like...8?

I was under the impression that she was around the same age as Ed/Al/Ling.  

>what would happen if he just knocked over that flask?

We won't have FMA. Plus, Hohenheim's also going RIP.  

>alcahestry

Alkahestry. Just a minor correction.

>This ED is so good. Not a good fit for that ending though.

Kinda gets better later on. [](#s "I see it as kind of an "the plan is set" kind of ED")

She looks so young compared to the others. Ed/Al are like 15/14 right?

Teenagers grow up a lot during those years, May is a little on the short side but it's still common for her age

Either the First OP and ED were just exceptionally good, or they've been getting worse as the change.

Though the show itself is still great. I hope Al gets his body back, but I'm not sure if there will be a totally happy ending after all is said and done.
>> ARTICLE
Nooo, I missed yesterday's. Kinda late, but did anyone else read the manga when Fruit Tree Alchemists was translating and they predicted Selim was Pride way before there was any real evidence? Good times.

Olivier and her squad are so bad ass. It's also cool to see Scar working together with everyone and episode 41 reinforcing the bond between Ed and Al.
>> ARTICLE
What a place to end for the day. Damn. This is insane. I was wondering where "Chekhov's Philosopher Stone" would end up for half the episode. 

Liking the new OP and ED.

I nearly threw up when watching the impalement bit in episode 41. Just... *gah.*
Also, Ed has the best names for the chimeras- Donkey Kong and Lion King.

One of my purchases came through! I am now [officially](http://i.imgur.com/5HmA5oE.jpg) a state alchemist.

***Disclaimer***: *No children or small animals were harmed in the acquirement of this item*

**Episode 23**

* Bet Ling sure is regretting wanted to meet the sins so much
*  Al has become ethereal with his alchemy. Ed needs to take lessons here
* Will we see Gluttony die? That is the question...
* Ran fan can't be dead...I won't believe it until I see it!
* Woah dude she cut off her arm and tied to a dog. What the...not sure even I could've thought of that
* Hawkeye getting some valuable cosplay in
* Not sure how Hawkeye instinctively knew where Lan Fan is
* Al making even more animal friends
* Wrath you sly son of a bitch
* Nawww don't tell me Winry is going again
* The longer you keep the whole 'meeting Dad' thing from Al the more it is going to bite you in the ass, Ed
* Dayyyyyyyum Winry getting in that sneaky end of episode love confession
* Wow that reincorporation of the arm trap, how did I not see that!
* Looks like gluttony was just charging his hyper beam all that time

**Episode 24**

* Looks like Dr.Marcoh basically confirmed one of my earlier theories. I guess the 'giant transmutation circle' he is on about is the capital city itself?
* Wrath's talking to pride it seems. Will we get a reveal?
* R.I.P butterfly
* Gluttony sure did have a crush on Lust
* "I love my father and everything about him"- you will probably want to amend that when he tries to sacrifice you kid
* You just got **LINGED**, envy
* Looks to me like Ed and Ling got out of the way of that blast, cliffhanger bait style
* Hope Envy is dead though
* It's ok guys, Hawkeye is clearly going to 1 vs 10 these generals and save Mustang
* Oh so Ed really did get sucked into Gluttony
* Is the skeleton in uniform a reference to someone we know?
* Shit just happened that episode

Surprisingly little to add theory wise after those episodes. We got our first interaction with Pride today, although we have yet to see Prides true form. Will be interesting to know why Pride chose to hide itself, beyond the whole spider thing. Next episode; Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

You should definitely watch it. It's part of a certain important character's backstory.

A new OP? Yay!

When I was watching I couldn't choose between the first and the third opening. Now I chose it with no thinking. It just is so awesome and that is when I couldn't take my eyes off the monitor. The series after episode 27 is the best shit ever.

Not quite that. Brotherhood rushing through removed quite a bit of the Lust/Gluttony interactions. Lust seemed to be more of an older sister figure for Gluttony.

I guess Ling told her.

> Hope Envy is dead though

[the "next episode" part](#s "already showed that Envy's in that...uhhh...thing? place? too.")

Well the crush on Lust was more of a joke :D

I don't really watch the 'next episode' announcements so that I can go into the episode completely spoiler free and without any expectations I wouldn't otherwise have.

Skeleton in the uniform inside Gluttony is Father Cornello from Liore I think, at least thats how I remember it.

Oh wow that's awesome! Thanks for pointing that out to me.

I know i'm a few days late with this, but I think it was actually Cornello's assistant- the one that saw envy transform into his/her's "normal" form.

**Off topic:** Whatever you do, **do not** buy from the bookdepository.com. Shitty customer service and straight up lies about delivery times. I actually ordered this box set almost two weeks from them and it said 'Available, dispatch 2 business days'. Waited 9 business days and it still hadn't dispatched, customer service rep told me they didn't even have it in stock and didn't know when they would. Had to get a refund and buy through amazon prime instead. Wish I had done that in the first place. Seriously avoid these guys like the plague, a quick google search shows that I'm not the only one who has had issues with them. 

**On topic:** Time to watch peeps die, yay!

**Episode 48**

* Ah Gluttony. I wish I could say I'm sad to see you go but honestly I like you better dead.
* Oh Grandpa ninja did actually show up
* Silly Ed, clearly her automail will work fine with the blessHaing of ship gods
* Pride must be mega charged if he can get beaten around this much
* Wonder why Hohenheim hasn't joined the fight. He seemed to know something was amiss and he would sure have the power to fight them
* WHAT? YOU GUYS ASSURED ME THAT THE SMALL JOKES WEERE AT AN END? DO YOU HATE ME /R/ANIME? 
* Wonder who mustangs biological parents were if Christina Mustang is just a foster parent.
* Wonder how he got orphaned too. House fire? 
* Hawkeye and Mustang are reunited at last!
* I think you speak for the viewers when you told them not to die Mustang
* You can't cut shadows yo
* Speaking of Al, why couldn't he move independently when Pride was cut off from the light?
* Pride is an asshole
* ED is starting pretty early this episode
* Like I said making Wrath even more pissed is only going to make his vengeance powers go through the roof. Then again he says humans are beneath him so does he actually care about his wife?

**Episode 49**

* Hohenheim is really not fussed about Pride or anyone but Al really. 
* Gotta give props to Prides design. As much as I hate the bastard he looks awesome and the shadow effects are really high quality
* AWWWWWW HELL YEAH!!! HOHENHEIM IS PISSSSSSSSSED!!!
* HYPE
* I find you plan is pretty bad Al
* Looks like we might finally see the Ling/Fan/Gramps fight against Wrath that has been teased for ages
* Seems like everyone's plans are contradicting each other
* Oh. Kimblee. He's still not dead?
* Also can Al not just beat the living shit out of Pride for a day? Even he can't quite kill him it would make him a lot weaker just as a fail safe
* I'm really interested to see who is the fifth sacrifice for this supposed 'promised day'. We know of four people who have seen Truth; Hohenheim, Ed, Al, Izumi...so who might be the fourth? I have three guesses currently. 1) MayMay. She has a past that we don't really know much about and she seems like an extremely talented alchemist for her age. Envy also seemed really eager about getting her back to central which might suggest more than just wanting to have a body again. 2) Scar. Deeply religious and dedicated to never use 'creation' alchemy. He seems to have mastered destruction magic like no one else as well. Perhaps his refusal to do creation based magic is a result of an encounter with Truth and not any underlying hate for state alchemists or limited research. I'll admit this one is the weakest of the three. 3) Mustang. We see that his fire alchemy is beyond the limits of many other alchemists regardless of the fact that he is the only one who can use fire alchemy. His master also seemed to know a lot about alchemy himself and passed the knowledge to mustang. Perhaps his master got the knowledge from Truth and became ill from it and Mustang merely carried the research on and also encountered Truth. Not sure what Mustang would have traded for it though, since of the equivalent exchange, it might be that his master became the live sacrifice since he was dying anyway. I don't know, just something think about since the time is nearly upon us.
* Pride is looking surprisingly calm trapped in that dome with Al. Told you that your plan was fucked, buddy. I bet he is hitting that helmet for a reason.
* Hughes ;_;
* I've never truly thought about it until now but the existence of all these human chimeras really goes to show just how pointless Mr."Let's Play" experiments were.
* Weird how the ED has been pushed forward in both episodes so far. Is there really any reason for these scenes to be after the credits rather than before?
* Oh Pride will be pissed if you kill his mother

**Episode 50**

* I get the sneaking suspicion that Madam President will end up dying by Wrath's hand, incurring the wrath of Pride. At least that is what I hope. In truth it is probably Greed that kills Wrath
* "you pigs in human clothing!" - Briggs is here!
* Wait a minute is Mustang the fifth sacrifice? I hadn't really looked into it before but he can use fire alchemy without a circle thing, he just clicks his fingers. Or am I mistaking how it works?
* OOOOH even Maria Ross is here. Now I'm worried thought because this music is too cheery. People are going to start dying and make this show depressing. 
* Mustang is going to owe a lot to people once he is Fuhrer
* MayMay you are not a smart person
*  Oh my god Satsuki actually called them pigs *teehee*
* Guys...I'm scared...creepy noises are happening underground
* I KNEW IT! I TOLD YOU AL, YOU DUMB ASS
* That's a cool looking secret door. Father has style. 
* Hohenheim is definitely splitting up so that he can confront Father on his own. This can only go wrong
* Oh shit the immortal army is born. Only the 300 spartan's can stop them now

So much is happening and yet there is still another 14 or so episodes. I hope this means Father will lose in the next few 4 episodes and then it will turn into Amagami SS: Fullmetal Edition.

But seriously I don't really have much of an idea how this will pan out, not that I really have much to go on theory wise anyway. Kinda sad actually compared to my page long ramblings in earlier threads. Guess that just means it's coming to an end ;_; At least now I have the manga to read! My heart won't be entirely empty after this with that in mind. 

See you again tomorrow. 
>> ARTICLE
> Speaking of Al, why couldn't he move independently when Pride was cut off from the light?

You probably got the answer already but it's a combination of his soul being detached from his body and [this](http://i.imgur.com/wOEYUGF.png)

> Oh Pride will be pissed if you kill his mother

Eh, he probably doesn't care. She is just a woman that was put in little part of his life. Wrath, though, sure would be...err...wrathful, since he does seem to love her. I mean, he told Hawkeye that he was the one who chose her as his wife.

> Wait a minute is Mustang the fifth sacrifice?

They did say he was a [candidate](http://i.imgur.com/IJ1XsAY.png) already
>> ARTICLE
>1) May, 2) Scar, 3) Mustang

Father and the homunculi discussed earlier in the show forcing someone to open the gate to turn them into a suitable candidate. I'm not implying anything one way or the other, but why are you ruling out Kimbley, Marcoh, and Armstrong? 
>> ARTICLE


Kimblee hasn't had a reason to experiment with alchemy since he has been spoon fed Philosophers stones. He was a weapon first and foremost and that carries the risk of death so you wouldn't want to put him in a situation where he could be killed by the MC if he truly was a candidate for sacrifice. 

Marcoh seems like a researcher and medic first and foremost. Most of his work was done at the will of other people and he didn't enjoy doing it so I doubt he would repeat the experiments on his own to encounter Truth. 

Armstrong didn't seem to even know what a homunculus is before she was told by Ed and I don't remember seeing her do any flashy alchemy so I would find it odd for her to have seen Truth.

As for the forced opening of the gate...that is entirely possible...I still think the show will go down the hidden secret route rather than that though. It would be odd to have your entire plan relying on finding someone in the heat of the moment, forcing them through the gate, then sacrificing them all within a single day.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're confusing which Armstrong he's talking about
>> ARTICLE
>Not sure what Mustang would have traded for it though

Something I had suspected but never ended up being touched upon in the manga [](/s "or show was, since they'd mentioned Mustang was a candidate, that killing Hughes was actually an attempt at getting Mustang to open the gate. He even mentions to Hawkeye that he fleetingly thought about human transmutation when Hughes died. Plus, even though Hughes was supposedly killed to prevent Mustang/etc from knowing about the ill deeds, the baddies sure didn't care a whole lot about how much he found out as time went on")

> I've never truly thought about it until now but the existence of all these human chimeras really goes to show just how pointless Mr."Let's Play" experiments were.

That's one of the other tragedies in FMA. Nothing is really gained from any of these horrible events. The brothers find out they had never actually transmuted their mom (which was good, but means they lost their bodies for no reason at all), Tucker's research was well behind what the military was already doing, and even though Hughes was silenced, the bad guys didn't seem to actually care when Mustang discovered the corruption - he probably could have lived with little effect on the plans.

Though, it's unclear how much time has elapsed, and in fact Tucker's work *could* be the reason that there are human chimeras, I dunno. At least, it seems like those guys suggest they were changed into chimeras, not born as chimeras.
>> ARTICLE
> the existence of all these human chimeras really goes to show just how pointless Mr."Let's Play" experiments were.

To be fair, they were created with the help of a philosophers stone.

And about Mustang, those gloves contain a flint, which creates sparks, and he uses the oxygen in the air to create flames with the circles on his gloves. This is also why he cant creates flames if hes wet, he isnt able to create sparks.

>Amagami SS: Fullmetal Edition

This needs to be made immediately.

I honestly forgot about that one, it's very small and Ed doesn't really overreacts to it so we may be forgiven a little for forgetting it

>Speaking of Al, why couldn't he move independently when Pride was cut off from the light?

He wasn't awake yet

>Wait a minute is Mustang the fifth sacrifice? I hadn't really looked into it before but he can use fire alchemy without a circle thing, he just clicks his fingers. Or am I mistaking how it works?

Heavily mistaking how it works: it's explained in FMA 2003 and the manga: the gloves have the circle and when he snaps his fingers a spark is created, then he changes the composition in the air to create the flames
>> ARTICLE
Related to the small joke, Ed isnt really all that small anymore.

Seriously, go have a quick look at an earlier episode.
>> ARTICLE
This just proves that I really need to read the manga. I can imagine I'll only join the show more because of it. Rewatchability woo!

They do talk about it sometimes in Brotherhood though. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/b1FIGem.png) is one example. They probably mention in one of the scenes in which Mustang tries to produce flames while raining too.

I'm waiting more on the reactions of [](/s "Al with the stone vs Kimbley and Pride and Mustang vs Envy") from episodes 52 and 53

I love [] (/s "Al vs Kimbley") because you realize [](/s "how completely badass Al is, the fact that he's more than a match for kimbley with a philosopher's stone AND PRIDE with just his hands and a meh lion chimera on his side")

Several times during that I was like [](/s "holy shit if this were Ed he'd be dead or captured already")

Do you think we can conclude from that that [](/s "Al is a better alchemist than Ed, or just that he is a better fighter overall")
>> ARTICLE
I reckon that [](/s "Al is a better fighter but Ed is a better alchemist ")
>> ARTICLE
I'd say both probably, but in terms of alchemy the complexity is kind of hard to judge... we don't see Al performing much complex alchemy, just the quick "make pillars of rock" stuff generally, but Ed was the one to make the human transmutation circles and often talks about the composition of matter, changes the properties of his arm, etc... Just because we haven't seen Al do those things doesn't mean he can't, though. Al is definitely quicker on his feet, too. Also [](/s "when Al starts using the philosopher's stone he shows just how shittily kimbley has been using it")

Don't you hate it when the episode ends on a cliffhanger, only for the next-episode preview to spoil the whole thing?

>Mr. Ho confirmed for shipping LanLing

It's not shipping when even glass is more opaque.
>> ARTICLE
> What would happen if one Homunculus eats all the other 6? would it create a sort of mini-father?

[Spoilers](/s "It would be more like the opposite, Father removed his sins to become perfect and that left him emotionless, a homunculous that absorbed all the sins would be very emotional")
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily, wasn't it mentioned that although Father tried to "remove his emotions and sins" it really wasn't the case?

In fact Father displays all seven sins throughout the series in one form or another, despite the creation of the Homunculi.
>> ARTICLE
Shit's going down! And it hasn't even started.

This show is wish fulfillment! Not only did we get Lan Fan back, but also Maria Ross. Totally wasn't expecting her. But then I felt like they trolled us when she had Roy talk to her accomplice in Xing. When the camera was panning, I had a holy shit moment because I was expecting it to be Maes Hughes instead of Havoc, who we just saw a couple of episodes ago.

We're already about halfway into the Promised Day but there are still 14 episodes left. That's one whole cour. I hope they don't drag things for too long.

> I hope they don't drag things for too long.

Don't worry, they saved the best for last. This last cour is probably the best cour of the entire series.

Late to the thread sorry. Already done 1 episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion+reactions so that explains why. 3 Episodes a day is going to kill me. I'm still thinking of a way on how best to handle it. Might just have to drop the reactions for NGE if it gets too much :(

**Episode 28**

* Liking this new OP for sure. Not as good as the first for me but an admirable effort none the less.
* ["Dad"](https://wiseguyindustries.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/its-a-trap.jpg)
* Haha Father is actually class. I thought he would act much more stereotypical evil
* Fathers logic admittedly makes sense. There is some nice contrast between him and Hohenheim at the end of last episode too. Guess one Father found a reason to care and the other didn't
* WOAH HE HAS AN EYE WHAT THE FUDGE
* Ling is about to become even more awesome
* THAT WAS WHY HE WAS WITH THE SINS IN OP. No idea why it took me until now to get that haha
* Is that greed ling is talking too? Seems to have the same face
* "I like your Greed" - Oh yeah, Greed is back baby!
* AWWWWW*wwwwww* YEEEEEEEEEAAAHHHH SCAR IS HERE
* MayMay gets reunited only to have their Ed fantasies crushed
* Scar is an independent Ishabal man who don't need no alchemy
* Scar is simultaneously my favourite and most hated character
* If this is the start of a Elric+Scar tag team I will be the happiest person alive
* MayMay looked for the perfect man in Ed, but found it in Al <3
* After credits scene? yes please
* Gluttony ain't yet out of the game then. Can't complain with that. He's one of the better sins

**Episode 29**

* I love how nonchalantly the Elric's interact with the Sins after every fight
* The expression on the [panda](http://i.imgur.com/bpx0SCD.png) in this scene. Fan service done right.
* I'm not sure how the Sins expect these people to stand aside while they destroy everything. They obviously haven't watched many Marvel/DC films
* Just like with Hawkeye, if you think Winry is going to be a weakness you really don't know her!
* Live Free of Scar Hard: Scar 4.0
* Lan Fan is so going to get automail and have a showdown with Greed. The ship Gods demand it.
* Glad to see the Major getting screen time again. He has been missed.
* Can someone give me the name of this doctor? I must have missed it. This guy is hilarious
* I like how he offered a cup of coffee to Al. Is this like the blind jokes from Avatar?
* That flow into the ED was nice. Best ED so far I think.
* Awww it's a little babi Gluttony
* If you think Scar is going to let you die that easily you are sorely mistaken

That's it so far for these two episodes. The third eye scene with Father was the one thing that particularly stood out to me. I wonder if Hohenheim will have an eye too? I certainly like the contrast between Hohenheims creation (Father) and Fathers creation (Gluttony) both trying to create a being to mimic that of Truth itself with one being significantly more successful than the other. Can't wait for the Ishabal crisis to be explored to, it's been hyped for awhile now. I want to see Scar join the good guys ;_;

But, back to Brotherhood:  

* So, father is not Hohenheim, but he knows him somehow.  
* He can disable alchemy  
* However, scar and May weren`t affected.  
* Ling accepted Greed rightaway. Brotherhood touched on it, but Greed himself was completely flummoxed too.
* Ling's acceptance meant that he's still in there, unlike Bradley.

At the 3/4 way point now. Just been informed that a certain delivery that I ordered like 50 years ago (seriously fuck their dispatch service) will be arriving tomorrow so I look out for it in tomorrows discussion. For now however enjoy my write ups that have now diverged into hype shouts and shipping, what have I become?

**Episode 45**

* We now return you to your regular broadcast schedule
* I like how Wrath explained him holding onto his memories
* Greed got the speed
* Papa Armstrong appears!
* Oh wow...I just realized that the girl in the pink dress is the same one that through the piano. Yoki broke into the armstrongs house.
* You may have a 3 star uniform Gamagoori but you are no match for Satsuki
* MayMay just encountered the communists dream town. 
* Ah Envy you sweet taker
* Ling is back!
* Damn right you prioritize that Ling+Lan fan ship
* Greed also needs a spin off series

* Just a simple housewife, walking on a cold day, saving the North
* Casually groping Rebecca's butt #justgrummanthings

* I think mustang must have forgotten the second 'cigarette' where Hawkeye confessed to him
* Look at you throwing the paper away before burning it in mid air, Mustang you show off

**Episode 46**

* Yay more Winry
* pffff haha! *a wild Ed appears*
* Looks like she doesn't have a wrench to throw at him
* Oh she found one
* I love how Greed [leaves the room](http://i.imgur.com/iHUChUc.png)
* Who needs Philosophers stone when you can just you a wrench
* Oh miles are you foreshadowing write now?
* Ed & Winry get a scene just to themselves. My ship is on full throttle. 
* "A day where we will get our bodies back or a day of great tragedy" - [why not both?](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/538/731/0fc.gif)
* GOD DAMN YOU ED WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? DO YOU NOT CARE FOR THE WRATH OF THE SHIP GODS?
* Ed looked a lot like Hohenheim when he was leaving
* Hmm the apple pie thing doesn't make up for before, Ed
* Equal rights, **FUCK YEAH!**
* "Little miss Bradley" - Grumman dressed up as a woman and still has more balls than anyone saying that
* Guys if Al dies before the end of this show I might not be able to continue
* "If something happens to me the mansion is yours" HOW DARE YOU TALK TO HAWKEYE'S MAN LIKE THAT, YOU'RE CROSSING INTO DANGEROUS TERRITORY THERE
* "It represents feminine beauty" PLEASE STOP MUSTANG WHAT IF HAWKEYE HEARS YOU ;_;
* Pissing off Wrath is like supercharging a battery. 
* Yeah I thought that sheepdog looked suspiciously like Hawkeye's
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH Father has left his castle. Shit is gonna go down next episode

**Episode 47**

* "A solar eclipse shows up tomorrow" WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO my prediction from back when Lust dies was right! Feel free to bow to me mortals. 
* I wasn't ready for the feels ;_;
* If Hohenheim really wanted to die with his family couldn't he just exhaust the usage of his Philosophers stone to the point where he could either age again or simply die at will?
* Pride you bastard >:[
* Oh yeah I forgot the chimeras can hunt on scent alone
* OH MY GOD IS THAT THE NINJA GUARDS???
* **YEP.**
* Lan Fan looks epic with that auto mail
* Oh it's just the[ one ninja actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjeiYzkUBQw) 

Please tell me Pride & Gluttony die next episode. The show has done a really good job in making me want them dead. It's also nice to know that one of my ships is back on course. Definitely excited to see how Greed alters the equation. Greed wants everything, even *all the women*, so perhaps he won't object to this.

>> ARTICLE
True. Shows how similar they are in a way. 
>> ARTICLE
Did you notice that [Ed is now taller than Winry?](http://i.imgur.com/I2yDWJW.jpg) So no more "Ed is short" jokes for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, they look like they're in their early twenties in that scene.
>> ARTICLE
I have noticed that he has grown across the series. The death of the short jokes is the most relieving thing ever. 
>> ARTICLE
I must have been the only one that found almost every short joke funny. 
>> ARTICLE
I always disliked all the short jokes too; they're OK but overused/exaggerated. I felt like the first anime had fewer, but they were still there.

**Episode 46**

* First recap at the start of an episode? Oooh, it's because of the timeskip.

* Miles isn't very trusty, is he?

* I don't get why greed doesn't just go full defense all the time :s Ed could defeat him that way, but Pride's not an alchemist!

* Sure is dark outside

* OH YEAH FUCK HIM UP LIONMAN

* Pride's not even taking any damage?

> Who is your favourite character?

Definitely Winry. [She's lovely](http://puu.sh/f9iWB/be17757ff4.png)

>Who is your favourite homunculus?

I'd have to choose between Wrath and...eh..No, wait, it's Wrath. Gluttony's the cutest one though.
>> ARTICLE
> So whose hands are those anyway?

In the ending? Probably Trisha and Hohenheim's
>> ARTICLE

He has to be, he's a living TBM.

>So is Ling actually a better fighter then Greed?

I would say by miles. For one thing, Ling actually has battle experience.

He doesn't like it, he says so back when he's in his original body

But honestly great episodes as always and what a [badass appearance!](http://puu.sh/f9oDp/40f2bbfe76.png)

I remember back when that undressing scene aired there was an earthquake at the same day in Japan, so the first airing looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/aPI89.jpg) (sorry for ant pic) and [this](http://www.anime-evo.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/snapshot20100301224640.jpg). The fans went mad!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I remember that, I also think there was a break for a couple of weeks at some point
>> ARTICLE
My favourite character is one of the Armstrong siblings. Olivier manages to be the most badass woman in a show that has Winry, Mei and Lan Fan. Alex can always make me laugh every time he appears, yet he has a deep backstory and his own character development. And their best scenes, that still have to come, are probably my favourite scenes of the entire show. [the scene](/s "where they fight against Sloth together.").

My favourite homunculus is a lot more difficult. My choice would have to be either Wrath or Greed, and I think most people who have watched the entire show know exactly why. I think I'll to choose Wrath here, but they are both really awesome. Their scenes are just some of the best of the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
I would say that you should spoil some stuff in your comment [](/s "but it's very obvious Wrath didn't die there")
>> ARTICLE
I think that most people will know that [](/s "Wrath didn't die there, since it wouldn't really make sense to kill an important villain that way")

I'll change my wording just to be certain though.


>> ARTICLE
Armstrong family is best family.
>> ARTICLE
fav character: Hughes ;__;

fav homunculus: i mean, the evil-lest one (best?) seems to be envy. Oh Hughes ()
>> ARTICLE
I might be alone in this but the ending sequence of episode 45 when everyone is warning one another of the Promised Day is one of my favourite parts of the series.

Shunkan Sentimental is also my favourite ED - every time that guitar kicked in the first time I watched this anime it got me so hyped for the next episode. Happy to say that hasn't changed.
>> ARTICLE
Awww yeah motherfuckin Lan Fan is back! I'm really starting to feel the hype!
>> ARTICLE
Welp guys, I broke. Just finished the series, but still gonna chill to check rascorpia's theorycrafting. Anyway, favorite character and homunculus is GreeLing because of based Troy Baker and because of how much Greed just grows on you as a character.
>> ARTICLE
Fav Character: ROY MUSTANG

Fav Homunculus: Greed
>> ARTICLE
Answering OP's questions 2 hours after posting the post-credits scene warning:

Mustang

Greedling

Favorite character: hmmm either Hughes or Mustang. Going with Mustang.

Favorite Homunculus: I think gluttony, he's hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
True fact: Hohenheim induces sad tears from me in record times.
>> ARTICLE
**Who is your favourite character?**

Olivier Armstrong, definitely.

**Who is your favourite homunculus?**

Greed is objectively the best, but I have a huge soft spot for Envy (mostly because of his Japanese VA, but also because he's actually somewhat sympathetic).
>> ARTICLE
Favorite character: Hard to pick between Olivier and Alex.
Favorite Homonculi: Greed, easily. Wrath a clear second.

Solid couple of episodes. Ed's looking manly as shit.

A Neon Genesis Evangelion rewatch huh? That's actually a classic series I was looking to get round to seeing as well...

Also it's my cakeday! I didn't even realize until I posted earlier but hey!  

\\( ^ _ ^ )/

Have a cake gif: [Nom](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3rveqmfgi1qdippyo1_500.gif)!

**Episode 25**

* Huh, Gluttony sure does eat a lot of hellfire
* When will the small jokes end? ;_;
* ***WHEN HE IS DEAD*** o_o
* No but really
* I'm curious as to whether the 'blood' they are in is actually Philosophers stone stuff. I'm pretty sure blood would just dry in the wrong environment
* Panda girl & Co. sparring just like Ed+Al
* *This summer...Scar is on a mission...to deconstruct the tears of little girls!* COMING to a cinema near you, **SCAR 3: PANDA WITH A VENGEANCE**
* It's Gluttony, surely you can find SOMETHING to eat
* Envy joins the team!
* Wooo my early prediction was right, although it wasn't a real tin foil one like others have been
* Hey! Show a little sympathy for Envy! At least you guys can age normally
* Oh shit. envy you sly son of a...Scar is gonna have your ass for starting the war
* No don't do it! Envy is Scars kill
* That CGI looks ugly
* "N-no S-senpai! Don't [touch me there](http://i.imgur.com/KORCai0.png)...or I'll...Kyaaaa!"
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH SHIT AL IS GON MEET FATHER! 
* THEN HOHENHEIM IS GON SHOW UP AND THEN OOOOOOOH 
* AND THEN AL IS GON BE LIKE, WHY DA FUCK DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YO? AND THEN ED IS GON BE LIKE SHIT, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO /u/rascorpia 
* "Brigadier General Hughes' daughter was so annoying during the funeral" OH NO HE DIDN'T. 
* I'm calling it now, Ed and Father will have a final confrontation, Ed will win after like 10 rounds in the ring, the credits will roll until the after credits scene. THEN Wrath will emerge from the smoke and Ed will say something cliche like "Shit that wound from earlier is preventing me from using alchemy" and Wrath will say something equally cliche like "Mwuhahahaha" and then Gracia Hughes will appear out of nowhere and say "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my husband. Prepare to die." before shooting him down.
* Not sure I can enjoy this show anymore now that I know how it ends
* *Hahaha* "She will become your weakness" - Yeah I don't think you know Hawkeye very well Mr.Fuhrer
* 'I'll let you finish your conversation before attacking' - Envy

**Episode 26**

* Envy sure does love to stand still in the middle of fights
* Hmm looks like May is going to lead Scar right after Al so perhaps he will meet Father as well? That would be a pretty convincing motive to turn good guy.
* *I still haven't forgotten mustache guy, so you have a lot to atone for Scar, -_-*
* Huh, so I'm guessing May can sense the Philosophers stone? She says she can feel people crawling beneath her and since we know that a Philosophers stone is basically just dead people inside a liquid then that must be what she can feel
* Holy shit I think she is trying to say that Father is also a Homunculus! She can sense the Philosophers stone but she is saying it's a person and I don't think there is any one Sin that she could otherwise be referring to so it has to be him. HOLD UP LET ME GET MY TINFOIL OUT
* So wait...Hohenheim created Father?? They aren't brothers?? I don't see any other way it could work to be honest. It has already been established that Homunculus created procreate yet Hohenheim has real children so it can't be that both Fathers are Homunculus. He must have created him. For what reason though? I can't think of any genuine reasons to create an evil all-powerful being so what the fuck? 
* Hohenheim has been established as an alchemist himself so maybe Father was just an experiment gone wrong? or is he a by-product of his immortality? 
* WAIT. Is that chair where Hohenheim created him? Is this his lab?? So many questions!
* Wrath has seen some shit. 
* Father certainly is a shy guy from what we have seen so far. Maybe Father is worried that Hohenheim could stop him if he revealed himself?
* You are not very smart doctors if you think you can create Wrath and the first thing he wouldn't do is kill the people who caused him immense pain
* Fuhrer just mentioned Pride like 50 times in a sentence, will we get the reveal?
* God damn it Ed I spent so long guessing the meaning behind that circle!
* Ed is just going to perform this transmutation and the first thing he sees is a Panda fighting Father
* So wait by Envy's additional explanation of the circle is it to be understood that Xerxes is where Hohenheim created Father? He was a scientist who wanted to cast God from the heavens and create the perfect being and that being was Father. It cost the entire population of Xerxes to do it though (causing him to end his research) and at some point Father went evil but I think I've got what this is trying to say. The only thing we seem to be missing is Fathers motives for being an evil son of a bitch. 
* I think ultimately Hohenheim created a 'perfect being' of sorts but he failed to cast God from the heavens which is in a large way evidenced by the existence of Truth & the gate which still act beyond the realms of the world as we know it. It's just a guess but what if Fathers motives for creating a country-sized Philosophers stone is in order to challenge that notion and go beyond where Hohenheim ended his quest? The only thin making me doubt this is that why would Father rely on something that Truth is basically unfazed by? Then again I can't pretend to know what a Philosophers stone of that magnitude is capable of so eh.
* Ed is saying Envy is from Xerxes but I think this is a red herring. Envy had a massive grin on her face when she said she would tell Ed and I think that is because she knows it was Hohenheim and Father at Xerxes not her. 
* Hmm wonder if Ed will get even better powers after this
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH IS THAT AL's BODY?
* Huh. Al needs to be the one to go to the gate of truth if he wants his body back
* Ed wins best Brother of the century award
* I may get the answer to this in a future episode but how could Al has a soul in the Truth world as well? I thought all he was missing was his body so shouldn't that just be like a brainless lobotomized teenage body rather than like a conscious version of Al? 

**Episode 27**

So apparently this is just a recap episode. If I see anything I'll be sure to point it out. 

* NEW OP! I FORGOT!!!!!
* First look at [Pride](http://i.imgur.com/EiGNbJT.png)? Or is that just a well dressed Ling?
* Looks like we will be getting a much bigger look into the Ishabal war next arc. I'm excited! 
* M-m-m-mustache guy? [Is that you](http://i.imgur.com/Ov4I1ul.png)? ;_;
* Seems as though [Mustang & Hughes](http://i.imgur.com/2iW0iz0.png) were at odds with the Fuhrer even during the war
* [Peeps being sacrificed](http://i.imgur.com/g19dUh8.png), Ishabal war underlying motive? They mention Gluttony was an attempt to create a gate so maybe this is how he spawned.
* That slideshow of all the characters during the war, Major especially, the definition of PTSD. Can't imagine Major harming kids and defenseless adults
* [Two new State](http://i.imgur.com/p9pmcDw.png) characters revealed! I'll say these are probably roguish bad guys...
* Now [she is a bad guy](http://i.imgur.com/DQL0bqR.png). We already have the good but badass blond lead in Hawkeye so this one has to be evil. 
* Also I see snow & a tank? Fullmetal Girls und Pazer
* [Satsuki Kuryuin](http://i.imgur.com/5WTWyOj.png) crossover confirmed
* Final scene focused on that flower a fair bit. Will we get Yuri bears this arc?
* Listening to the OP again uninterrupted. Yep, not skipping.
* Damn this recap really puts it into perspective just how much the story has progressed in a mere 27 episodes and we are not even half way yet
* Is this recap trying to say Hohenheim is also a hommunculus? The fuck? I thought it was established that they can't procreate...unless he is like the primal hommunculus or something?
* Teamwork! **FUCK YEAH.**
* ED ain't half bad either. Nothing wrong with more Winry.

Well that felt like a long time. Not sure how well I will keep up once this goes to three a day. I'm a simple creature and my brain gets tired from thinking too much so don't blame me :(



>> ARTICLE
> Now she is a bad guy. We already have the good but badass blond lead in Hawkeye so this one has to be evil

How dare you speak evil about her, she is a glorious character, perhaps even better than major Armstrong. She is certainly the most badass female character in the show.
>> ARTICLE
minor spoiler?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if that really is a spoiler, given the way they introduce her.

You have no power over me /u/huloca

In all seriousness though, she'll be introduced around episode 32/33 I think, so you'll quickly see why she is such a badass.

Edit. Happy cake day btw, I guess I will let it slide because it's your cake day.
>> ARTICLE
> Huh, so I'm guessing May can sense the Philosophers stone? She says she can feel people crawling beneath her and since we know that a Philosophers stone is basically just dead people inside a liquid then that must be what she can feel

Somethng to do with her Alkahestry skill. Then again, despite not being an Alkahestrist, Ling can sense some similar stuff too, so guessing more of a Xing skill.

>Mustache Guy

I forget, was his name mentioned in Brotherhood?

>Envy  
>her  

Unusual pronoun. Envy's generally considered "he", but from what I heard Word of God puts Envy as genderless.

>You are not very smart doctors if you think you can create Wrath and the first thing he wouldn't do is kill the people who caused him immense pain

[Still](#s "better than getting turned into philosopher's stones- remember lab 5?")
>> ARTICLE
May has already talked about being able to sense chi, which in almost every eastern media is life energy. I think she can just sense life and she probably also noticed the chimaera on the way.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, not quite sure if it's a general Xing skill or something related to Alkahestry.
>> ARTICLE
[Not sure if later into series spoilers] (/s "I believe Ling says he can sense someones chi at some point, but that could have been during one of the later fight scenes that I saw")
>> ARTICLE
Ever since episode 15 he says he can sense life energy, which in japanese it's always named chi
>> ARTICLE
Ok good, I was worried that I had prior knowledge because I watched 2 of the later fights on youtube a while back.
>> ARTICLE
His name is Basque Gran and it was mentioned briefly before Scar kills him in Episode 4

Happy cakeday

It's getting close

There's a thing with the 3rd opening: it's badly timed, you see tons of characters that are not going to appear for quite some time

Happy Cake Day! Boy you make me feel old when you are going over all of your theories. Don't worry Pride will show up soon, it's my favorite reveal of the show behind Wrath. Also, thank you for pointing out the Satsuki pose. It's hilarious considering how similar their personalities are. I forgot how much they spoil in that OP. If they had just waited another episode or two it would have been fine, but hopefully you haven't put the pieces together yet (or concocted some grand theory to make sense of it).
>> ARTICLE
Hmm there is more to the snow people? I'll avoid thinking about it until it comes up in show then. No point in ruining a good thing.

Oh, you poor thing! :P Don't forget that at some time it will be 4 episodes a day. Evangelion and stuff. Happy Cake DAy!!!!

Why wasn't I aware of this? :O 26's ending is amazing. This is a great couple of episodes minus the recap. You really start to put things together seeing what Envy really is (kind of), finding out about Gluttony's purpose and seeing the other side of the Gate of Truth. I hope you don't mind me crashing your rewatch ^_^
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree with you 100%. The ending for episode 26 is definitely one of my absolute favorites in the series (it makes me more emotional than I care to admit haha) and in general one of my favorite episodes for exactly the reasons you said. I think the story really kicks it into high gear starting episode 25. (Plus, what is better than Ling and Ed partnering up? They were such bros! I loved it.)
>> ARTICLE
Damn. I think this is the first time I've watched a recap episode. The last scene in episode 27 is beautiful. :') Argh it's hard to not marathon the rest of the ep now...by the way, when are we watching 3 eps a day?

After episode 35. Damn, when did we get to episode 27? :(

Almost half way already?? No way T_T On another note, thanks for hosting the NGE rewatch as I was not sure when to watch it so it really helped me make my decision

Welcome, welcome, one and all to today's six episode write up. I can't guarantee I will be able to watch the episodes tomorrow so I'll do them today just in case. I will be able to pop in and say hello at the least, that's if senpai misses me ;_; . 

**Episode 51**

* Last OP? :( 
* Everyone looks so sad, this is going to be a happy arc right?
* I like the song. Probably 2nd best IMO
* Oh they are not firendly mister evil boss man
* You should probably take this opportunity to run mr.scientist
* Should've saved a bullet for yourself
* That is one big army of immortal dudes, guess when MayMay and the Ninjas were saying there was so many souls trapped underground it wasn't just the Sins/Father
* Well done Al, even I knew it was code and I don't even know morse code
* Woah MayMay turned into Bruce Lee
* MayMay you're just as bad as Al. You really were made for each other.
* Satsuki for Fuhrer
* AWWWWWWWW YEAH ARMSTRONG+ARMSTRONG TAG TEAM
* I never realized how much I wanted this
* Surprised the wounded guy didn't take the Philosophers stone and then carried Al with him to safety. I suppose they didn't want to waste the power of the philosophers stone when it could be used to wreck face
* The imagine of the massive transmutation circle in the ED looks beautiful

**Episode 52**

* Oh hell yeah! 1v2? No biggie when you got Al
* Turning his leg into a sword was a cool idea
* Problem is he is going to burn through that Philos' so fast
* Get wrecked, son.
* "Why not both?" You read my mind Al
* He's fast for a sloth
* Please, he is just like one of those classic video game bosses. All you have to do is make him charge into the pillars that support the room and it will collapse on him.
* That or have him run into an electrical fence
* YEAH EAT THAT KIMBLEE!
* So I guess these manquin's basically act like the Sins where they have a limited number of lives
* OOOOOOOH LITTLE BRO ARMSTRONG PROTECTING HIS SISTER ;_; :D
* WOAH. WOAH. DID YOU JUST CALL YOKI MUSTACHE MAN? THAT IS JUST INSULTING TO THE [ONETRUEMUSTACHE](http://i.imgur.com/jpimmXU.png) 
* The fuck? Why did you just throw Kimblee back to him?
* Bro you about to get eaten
* Envy is going to be insanely hard to kill with all these maniquins she is consuming
* Yeeeeeeaaaaaah buddy. Everyone is almost back together now!

**Episode 53**

* Poor Madam President, she didn't ask for any of this and now she is just being used as a tool :(
* Awww he is so happy to hear Maria's voice
* Briggs! Briggs! Briggs!
* "I thought you despised liquids, since they make you useless" Ah this ships banter puts a smile on my face 
* Mustang needs a nerf
* You know how I said Envy is going to be mega powerful? Yeah that won't matter now that she is facing like 50 people
* Envy really is the best
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH 
ENVY KILLED HIM IS THE ANSWER
* THIS IS THE SHOWDOWN I WANT
* I'm like a child at christmas atm. Mustang is going to cook her like a hog on the roast
* Even Envy is scared of him
* This isn't even a fight, this is an execution
* NO YOU GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM HAWKEYE NOW YOU BITCH
* Wow that was a pretty obvious cliffhanger right there. Envy is Mustang and Hawkeye knows it.


**SPOILERS FOR TOMORROWS THREAD BELOW** 


**Episode 54**

* Huh so Mustang was the one who scarred her back, of her own will of course.
* All the more reason for this ship to happen
* "What do you think you are doing to my irreplaceable subordinate?" <3
* You better listen to Hawkeye!
* Hughes ;_;
* "I can't lose you" IT'S HAPPENING
* Envy's breakdown looks like hurts more than anything mustang did
* That whole tunnel scene was just amazing
* When Satsuki gives you an order, you follow it.
* Haha, "My shoulder joint is back in!" I love this show
* A housewife!
* Hohenheim you are setting yourself up for disaster taking Father on alone

**Episode 55**

* Scar hasn't heard those two words in a lifetime
* Your presidency didn't last long mr.
* Guess those chains are...*such a drag*...heh
* Oh that fist with the door. Why is every character so brilliant
* Wait a minute...is there a Satsuki+Mohawk ship going on that I have been completely oblivious too? I feel like a failure of a human being :(
* [I think I just wet myself](http://i.imgur.com/auxLVUn.png)
* And on that day, a bromance was formed that would last a lifetime
* I wonder if Father basically inherited small aspects of Hohenheim's personality into himself when he created a human form for himself.
* Or maybe not
* Hohenheim makes a good friend but still a shitty parent
* Don't celebrate yet. This is the calm before the storm!
* Annnnnd he's back

**Episode 56** 

* Hohenheim is more powerful than I expected
*WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH HE JUST MORPHED INTO...WHATEVER THAT IS
* Looks like Truth in a way. Guess he really is trying to be as close to Truth as possible
* Oh Bear Mohawk better not die here!
* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
* Satsuki is going to kick your ass yo, don't even forget about Greed too
* Speak of the devil!
* Excitement levels overload
* THE NINJA'S ARE HERE
* TOO MUCH HYPE IS SO FEW EPISODES ARRRGGHHHHH
* Why is it ending there??? I want more god damn it

8 Episodes left, following tomorrows thread. What will be the format going forward? 4 then 4 or 3, 3, 2 or 3, 5? I could probably handle any of those formats so whatever you guys choose to do really. I've turned into a little fangirl with these episodes so now I'm just shouting a the screen every five seconds. I don't see this show falling below a 10/10 unless it REALLY fucks up the ending which I would be very shocked if it manged to do that considering how consistent it has been so far. 

More hype fights plz

> 8 Episodes left, following tomorrows thread. What will be the format going forward? 4 then 4 or 3, 3, 2 or 3, 5?

I would vote for 4 then 4, that way on Sunday everybody will go "Fuck it, let's finish this" after the ending of episode 60
>> ARTICLE
> "Fuck it, let's finish this"

That is a very real possibility considering how much has happened in just a short few episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
>AWWWWWWWW YEAH ARMSTRONG+ARMSTRONG TAG TEAM
>OOOOOOOH LITTLE BRO ARMSTRONG PROTECTING HIS SISTER ;_; :D
>Haha, "My shoulder joint is back in!" I love this show

And now you have finally come to what I personally think are the most epic moments of this anime, and the reason why I think the Armstrong siblings are the best characters of this show. These scenes are just so awesome.

>And on that day, a bromance was formed that would last a lifetime

Also, the best scene of the entire anime.


>Annnnnd he's back

The reason why I think Wrath is the best homunculus is this, and the following episodes.

>TOO MUCH HYPE IS SO FEW EPISODES ARRRGGHHHHH

Welcome to easily the best cour of the show. These 14 episodes alone are enough reason to put this show at number 1 on MAL, and deservedly so, every single one of those episodes is amazing. They all have high quality, and the best episodes haven't even come yet.

Also, I can feel your hype. I felt exactly the same, and only being able to watch 3/4 episodes of this a day was one of the hardest things I ever had to do.

>I've turned into a little fangirl 

Welcome to the club :). Also, why have I been assuming you're a guy? Now I'm curious who you think is the best female character. My choice is still Olivier, although Winry is a close second.

Edit. I really urge everyone to do 4/4. That's the best way to do this show, trust me. You want to stop at the ending of episode 60 before watching the last 4. This also provides the best entertainment for the people who have already watched the show.

>> ARTICLE
> These 14 episodes alone are enough reason to put this show at number 1 on MAL, and deservedly so

I'm still undecided on whether this is my favourite anime but regardless I can now understand why it is #1 on MAL

>  Now I'm curious who you think is the best female character.

There is no best girl, there is purely best girl**s**. 

> I really urge everyone to do 4/4.

Seems that is two votes for the 4/4 format. Will have to wait and see what /u/xArDDe is going to do.

>I'm still undecided on whether this is my favourite anime

Now I'm curious, what do you think is better than FMA:B. The only things  I can think of are Steins;Gate, Madoka Magica and maybe Gurren Lagann ^^might ^^be ^^biased ^^here, ^^these ^^are ^^my ^^favourite ^^shows , but you haven't seen the last one yet.

>There is no best girl, there is purely best girls.

Olivier and Winry are obviously best girls. Olivier is more badass though. There, I said it.

>Seems that is two votes for the 4/4 format.

Please go for this. Episode 60 is just such a perfect episode to end on. Trust me, youll know exactly what Im talking about when you have seen it. It will be the ultimate test of endurance. 
>> ARTICLE
> Now I'm curious, what do you think is better than FMA:B.

All my 10/10s feel like an acquired taste so I don't even know the answer to that myself.

The lack of Hawkeye in this sentence disappoints me.

>The lack of Hawkeye in this sentence disappoints me.

It was past 3am over here, I was tired, forgive me. They are indeed the holy trinity of female characters in this show.

Edit.

>All my 10/10s feel like an acquired taste

That is true, 10/10s are the most subjective rating one can give most of the time. I'll give you Bake and Spice and Wolf though, and Fate/Zero or Gurren Lagann that you are currently watching are also 10/10 material.

About Sloth. Him being the fastest and most physically powerful Homunculus is supposed to be a play on the idea that those who act slothfully (?) can have awesome potential that they are wasting.

* Goddamn those things are creepy as fuck. RUN SCIENCE GUY

* WHY ARE YOU STANDING STILL YOU IDIOT.

* he could've easily outrun them.

* Barry's corpse is still there? :S

* Olivier is a dick. 

* Oh hey Sloth! I wonder how intelligent he actually is. Gluttony was stupid too but he seemed to know about all the plans.

* I don't like scenes with the cyclops soldiers. They're way to creepy!

* Can someone translate the morse? I wonder what he's actually saying

* Wait Lionman is already translating it! or not. Eh.

* Fucking Kimbley

* Splash page told me I'm supposed to call these mannequin soldiers. I still don't like em.

* aw shit Envy's back.

* I wonder if the other Homunculi could also pull something like that off...I suppose not, seeing how they don't have their respective worm forms?

* Lionman ;_;

* SLOTH VS OLIVIER. I honestly don't know who I want to win.

* BEST ARMSTRONG RETURNS 

* "I'm trying to save your life asshole!"

* "I've been carrying this Chekhov's gun around the entire time!"

* "Upgrade acquired!"

* YOU GUYS ARE FUCKED NOW FULL POWER ALPHONSE GOOOOO

* New ED! I like it. No after credit scene!

**Episode 52**

* AL GONNA FUCK YOU UP

* Decoy! :D

* Casual Kimbley chatter

* I wonder what Pride is thinking right now. "Goddammit now I'm stuck AGAIN what the hell is Kimbley waiting for"

* WE ARMSTRONGS VS SLOTH NOW. 

* I love how all soldiers who come to arrest Olivier get casually killed CONSTANTLY

* KIMBLEY A FUCKED NOW LIONMAN CONFIRMED FOR BEST CHIMEARAPEOPLE

* Why is the ED song starting already? STUFF MUST BE GOING ON.

* Alex confirmed for best Armstrong. AGAIN. Besides Catherine I guess.

* Pretty sure Pride could just go around Kimbley's body? 

* GUESS YOU COULDN'T STOP THAT CAR COULD YOU PRIDE

* Yoki being useful counter: 3 or 4?

* Pride stop eating people, That stuff will kill you.

* Sloth isn't looking very well.

* Aw fuck it's the MS squad again. 

* I've come to the conclusion that Olivier is just batfuck insane

* GUESS WHO CAME KNOCKING. 

* again, no after credit!

**Episode 53**

* Random street people, you should all go inside.

* Poor miss Bradley :c

* okay, NOW poor miss Bradley :C

* I just love the face the black general has when the radio director throws down the phone

* Brosh knows Ross' alive :D

* Damn, power of the media right there

* POWER OF FIRE GOOOO

* Roy's got some serious AoE

* Envy's famous

* Envy's fucking whistle

* Things you should never do, number 1: Aggravate Roy.

* I think you're the moron Envy. I really do.

* Man Envy does NOT KNOW HOW FUCKED HE IS

* Pride vs Roy who would win? Because I think that's the only fight that's even fair for a Roy vs Sins

* "What's it like having the fluid in your eyes boil? I imagine it might sting a little" Jesus christ Roy

* I like how stupid Envy becomes when his normal tricks fail.

* That's a nice cliffhanger! no after credit scene!

Also, no reactions from me tomorrow :/ I'll make up for it on sunday!

* Ed calling himself small..."OW NO I CALLED MYSELF A TINY LITTLE PIPSQUEAK!"
* Remember Barry from the first anime? Yeah, this is what happened to him. At least he's (well, will be) more affiable now.  
* [Unlimited Whatever Works](http://i.imgur.com/2NOVhYA.png), anyone?

It's been a while since I watched the series and even longer for the OVA. But, she definitely seems to be basically the same character (aside from the paper powers).
>> ARTICLE
Welp that's a lot of people wanting two episodes a day. You guys have so much time to burn ;_;

**Episode 7**

* Scar's getting fucked up; can't say I feel sorry for him though
* Mustang seemed like an evil mastermind discussing his plans for when he is furher. Something gives me the feeling that he won't be so eager to be furher by the end of series
* Since the '7 deadly sins' are starting to come into play now I thought I would list the ones I am aware of so far. Lust= The woman in the red dress, Gluttony= Fat dude who eats people, Envy= The trap but not a trap. The others who I don't think we have met are Greed, Sloth, Wrath and Pride. I can't think of anyone we have met so far that would fit these titles but that makes sense since the others have made pretty explicit as to who they are. I'm starting to wonder if there is a connection between Truth and the 7 Sins besides them all being assholes, it would certainly fit the religious undertone here. 
* Also now that I think about it, it's weird that Lust & Gluttony went out of their way to kill Scar. Perhaps he is the good guy after all, or maybe their plan relies on state alchemists and he is simply getting in the way of that. Could they have the power to bend alchemy/alchemists to their will?
* Hold up now 'Father' isn't a deadly sin. Perhaps that is their name for 'Truth'. 
* That said maybe 'Father' is the opponent to 'Truth'? I mean sure Truth practically killed Al but it seemed like he was actually trying to show Ed something at the time...argh my brain hurts.
* Kinda surprised they would be given an escort that don't even understand the nature of Al and the armour...I smell a redshirt
* Lady has some issues
* Lady has some talent
* '1000 Meals for daily living' now I smell the Da Vinci Code
* Wooo! I was right for once
* Now that Envy has been put into play I'm constantly suspicious that it could be anyone close to Ed+Al. Heck that would be the best way to destroy the copied documents.
* So the Philosophers stone is made with human sacrifice. Guess that is why it is blood red then. That also puts a full stop to Ed's plan on using it recover his brothers body
* Major turned into Ira Gamagori just then
* Edward Holmes and Alphonse Watson on the case
* Woah the voice Ed just did was creepy as all hell (vent scene in the sub version)

**Episode 8**

* Following on from my thoughts on the 7 sins I decided to do some guesswork based on the OP. I'm guessing that [this](http://i.imgur.com/nevJjCV.png) is one of the other sins since it has already been established how Envy normally looks...since the character that he changes into has an expensive looking fur coat I'm guessing this is Greed?
* [Dat ass](http://i.imgur.com/aZUT5g5.png)
* Huh his automail isn't working properly. Guess that is why there was the after credits scene in episode 6. Thanks /u/Illidan1943 and /u/arahman81
* Loved that transition from Ed saying "I've never won" to Al wrecking face
* "Sorry I've never heard of you" after all that. Al is the superior Elric brother
* "You're not going to say something like 'we are actually a trio' are you?" Man I'm actually started to like the humour now, such a good episode
* Please tell me Scar or the Major is going to show up to kick these Deadly Sins asses
* Guess Envy+Lusts monologue confirms that there plan relies on alchemists
* Kimberly gets introduced. Not sure what role he is going to play although they are scared enough by his alchemy to put a block in between his hands.  He certainly took a lot of pleasure from that building being blown up so no need to wonder why.
* Funny little after credits scene asking the hard questions


Blergh that took awhile. Starting to see things unfold now which is a good change of pace although I find Al questioning his humanity to be somewhat contrived, I mean he's been like this for a decade and yet never even thought about it himself?  Plus you think he would take care of the butcher to get out of danger AND THEN have his existential crisis.  Whatever I can judge it better once it has fully played out. Lets just hope I can keep up with the threads.

2 small things: The title is Fhrer, or Fuhrer if you don't know how to write a  (actually Fuehrer would be the correct way to write it without a , but we don't want to split hairs here), and the guy's name is Kimblee. Kimberly isn't really a villain's name, unless you're in a teenage movie at a US highschool and Kimberly is that bitchy cheerleader.

Yeah the 'Fhrer' thing was me just being lazy. Takes me so long to watch the episodes and do these write ups so I cut corners here and there. Didn't know about the Kimblee thing though. I must just have bad subs because It appeared as Kimberly on mine hence the confusion.

In the original there is an episode [](/s "dedicated to an encounter Ed, Al, and Winry have with Barry the Chopper when they are a bit younger. Whether or not this is canon, I'm not sure. But they both definitely know who he is when he reveals his name.")
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't happen in the manga and Al doesn't remember Barry so I'm thinking its not canon.  It was an interesting aside from the original anime though.

I guess Arakawa dumped that because she found Al not recognizing a supposed-to-be infamous killer a better gag.

Love the write-ups. I've already seen the series, this being my first re-watch (thought I've been wanting to for awhile now) and it's really entertaining to see other's thought process as they discover this awesome series.
Hope you're able to keep up with the discussion threads, and keep doing what you're doing, not going to be specific but some of your predictions are pretty spot on so far.

It's an out of context spoiler. You either say something vague that could apply to all characters or show something that won't make sense until the actual scene comes up. It doesn't spoil anything you just know what it is.

Similar to how the [Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei OPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBkEVuElJcw) have spoilers in them, but they're hidden among a lot of really weird stuff so you don't notice them, only if you actually know how the series ends.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so it's 2 episodes from today? Crap, I need to go watch episode 8 then.

Episode 7 is the first instance where the ending is a bit cliffhangery and I feel a little compelled to go watch what happens next. Just a little though, because in the back of my mind, the one thing I'm certain about is that no matter what happens, both Ed and Al will come out unscathed and everything will be daijoubu. Unlike other shows with paper thin plot armor for the MCs and death flags death flags everywhere (SnK, AkG), there's no sense of dread that keeps you going until you find out you're at the last episode.

**Episode 11**

* Seeing Winry going crazy over the automail shops made me happy
* Even the automail experts admire Winrys' work!
* Ed is pissssssssed
* Now Ed has turned into an Elfen Lied character
* Winry going full fan girl is a sight to see
* Wouldn't be FMA:B without another small joke
* I like how when he was picturing himself being tall he was bigger than Al...Al is like 7 foot, dude
* I've never really noticed it before but Al blushing in that armour is hilarious
* Guess one must become a Midwife to become an Automail Apprentice
* Al so [Kawaii](http://i.imgur.com/YK1moPF.png)
* Omg why is grandpa blushing it just looks wrong
* Looks like we see our first shot of Greed (at least I think it is) on the poster in the background. It fits into the Sin perfectly though if he is wanted for stealing or something like that.
* No more Winry ;_;

**Episode 12**

* So that first scene straight up confirms the first part of my theory below. WOOP WOOP!
* God I love the chemistry between the Elric brothers. They play off each other so well in scenes like the Izumi kick
* Ed getting hit by the hearts emitting from that couple was actually amazing
* Hohenheim- so we now know the name of MCs Dad
* oooooooooooooh that was one of the scenes in the OP
* Man they had an awesome mom
* Hmmm I wonder what this wish was. For his experiments to succeed perhaps?
* Bunny: Moe mode activated
* Awww those baby foxes are viciously tearing into the flesh of that live bunny
* Ed+Al are the sons she never had ;_;

Another two episodes down and as promised I will share my new theory. Sit down 'cause this will be a long one. FYI I wrote the points of the theory down before I watched the latest two episodes which is why I don''t mention any of it (especially 12).

So here's the second stage of my conspiracy theory, it is my craziest theory yet.

*WHAT IF*...

*WHAT IF*...

MC and the Sin's **shared the same father**?

Hear me out. You may be thinking...

> 'The fuck /u/rascorpia? you really think the fuhrer is the MCs dad?'

No.

You're right.

**He isn't**. 

That's because the Fuhrer isn't the 'Father' we have been hearing
about! This is gonna be a multi-layered theory here so I'll try and make it as
coherent as possible but apologies in advance. 

First we need to understand that MCs Dad is one behind the sins creation. It has already been shown that he is an Alchemist and that, if my guess is correct, *he left to the city to experiment with human transmutation and/or the Philosophers stone* as evidenced in the OP where we see a blond man with glasses heading to the city before he takes [one last look back](http://i.imgur.com/sBRSe1S.png). Given the set up of this particular scene we can imply that he is looking back in the  direction of MCs house because (obviously) he is their Dad. More, slightly weaker evidence, is that he also shares the same hair colour as his two sons and has the same ponytail as MC which I think is an intentional choice by the creators of the show. Genetics plays an important role as to the Father and the Sins but I won't go into that just yet.

> 'Ok so we've established that the blond dude is MCs Dad. *What makes you so sure 
> that he is the father of the sins ey*, /u/rascorpia?'

Right so there is some guesswork about to go on but I think I have some solid ground to argue my point here. Well we need to talk about human transmutation before we can talk about that. I have three reasons in favour of the argument that MCs Dad was researching it. 

1) While still at home, we see him buried into his desk with his research in the same way that Mr."Let's play" was. He was **obsessed** with the impossible and his obsession is what drove him to the city so that he could experiment away from his family as to not involve them while also having more resources to play 
with. 

2) In episode 2 we see Ed reading his Dads books. Now maybe I'm reading too much into this but maybe his Dads book collection revolved around human transmutation? I mean that is where they learn how to do the circle thing so it's not *too much* of a stretch to believe...

3) Now this point ties into the genetics I was talking about but here goes. What if the Elric bloodline are the only ones who can transfix a soul to a form in the real world? It would seriously be the perfect explanation for the existence of the Sins! I'm splitting this one up into a separate point so that I can better illustrate this.

Follow me here; Dad researches human transmutation, becomes [obsessed](http://i.imgur.com/Zb36scV.png) with it and starts doing crazier and crazier experiments, Driven into madness by 'truth' he inevitably experiments too far and creates the Sins through a combination of human sacrifice and his bloodlines ability to transfix a soul to a worldly form. 

> 'Sure I guess that could work but what makes you say the Sins are transfixed and not 
> their own being, /u/rascorpia?'

**Simple**. *The marks we have been seeing on them*. Remember in an earlier thread I pointed out that Lust had a mark like Esdeath? Well now that I think back on it I believe that this mark is what ties the Sins to this world much in the same way that Al's mark works. See MCs Dad succeeded in summoning life through human transmutation but given the horrific nature of human sacrifice he actually transfixed the embodiment of Sins to this world under his command. **The mark is their seal**. If we look back on Episode 10 when Hughes throws a knife into lusts skull she does not die. This is because he did not destroy her mark a la the samurai brothers in the previous episode! Makes sense right? **YEP!** 

Now this is when my theory from last time and my new one now converge. Driven mad from his experiments, MCs Dad uses the new Sins he has created to start gathering people for the ultimate human sacrifice in order to make the most powerful Philosophers stone. See at first I was thinking it was just Alchemists that were needed but now I am **much wiser** to the grand scheme of things! Notice how *Envy was taking on the role of a preacher* before? that is because Envy+Lust and Gluttony are using their influence to control the masses. They are killing important figureheads to the general public and replacing them with
Envy so that they can be manipulated at will. This leads me onto the Fuhrer.

***He is actually one of the Sins.*** 

Alright, alright, I know this is probably fucking with your brain like it did with mine but hold onto that for a moment. 

> 'Wow /u/rascorpia, what's next, 9/11 was an inside job?'

*Think about it!* He controls the state, keeping them from catching wind of 'Fathers' plans. He also gathers the Alchemists together while Envy and the others gather the public together. That way they can be manipulated at 'Fathers' will. Now this is more of a guess but *what if he hides his mark behind his eye-patch*? They all have their mark in a different place and I mean an eye-patch like his implies he has a permanent scar, so no one under his command is ever gonna question it, yet its real purpose is **is to hide his mark**!

Now I'm not sure which Sin he is but at the moment I'm leaning towards Pride. At first I thought his character **doesn't make sense**. All the other Sins were pure evil so why the hell do we keep seeing him be so friendly to everyone, especially his troops? Then it hit me. ***THIS IS PRECISELY WHY HE IS A SIN***. If he is Wrath then that explains the scene in episode 1 where he looks super pissed before killing the rampaging ice dude- it's because he was killing his troops, so **WRATH** was taking **REVENGE**!

The case for Pride also works and fits really well. He is super nice to the troops 
because he is *proud of his subordinates*! This would also be compounded by the fact that he promoted Hughes up to Brigadier General as a sign of respect- *he takes pride in him*. This is why I think Pride is more believable than Wrath because you can't really say he promoted Hughes out of anger or revenge but you can say he did it because he was **PROUD** of the Lt.Colonel!

And if you weren't yet convinced that MCs Dad is the 'Father' of the Sins then I beseech you to recall [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/aXEtVab.png) from episode 1. **THAT IS MCs DAD**. He looks rugged and tormented because that is what his experiments have turned him into. Notice how it is immediately after the ice dude is stopped by Pride+Armstrong and Mustang that we see this scene? and how his reaction goes from alarmed to restful? It's because ice dude posed a threat to his plan but with him stopped, he is calm again. The creators showed us this because unless you have super keen eyes and memory then to the average viewer this episode does not foreshadow anything. ***BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE UP TO, SUCH IS THE POWER OF THE TINFOIL!*** 

One last point I would like to make is to do with the prison episode where MC  meets Lust and Envy. *The reason they don't kill MC*? It's not because he is an Alchemist. Sure they are part of the plan but I doubt they would let any old Alchemist live who had seen what they were up to, no, the reason they let him live was because they know MC is 'Fathers' son. Now whether they kept him alive because he is key to the plan or if it was just the will of 'Father'* we have yet to see* but It could actually be both reasons. I'll need **more info to build on this part of the theory though** ;_;

Well I guess **that is it** for my theory so far. There is gaps and I'm still not sure what 'Father' intends to do once he has the power he chases. I'm expecting an epic Father+Son showdown however, if anything that has to be the most explicitly foreshadowed part of my theory. **GET HYPE!**

I really enjoy reading your posts every thread. I won't confirm any individual point, but I will say this one is better than the previous one. 

One thing about the fuhrer, don't forget he has a wife and child. 
>> ARTICLE
He has a wife and child? Wuuuuuuuuut. I must not of been paying as much attention as I thought I was. 

I'll need to think on that...
>> ARTICLE
I think it was the first episode where he said he could brag to his son about working with the fullmetal alchemist.

I'll try and rewatch it at some point then

Don't worry, you'll see more of them in due time, at this point, the only thing you can now is that he has a wife and son.

Get ready, the next 15 episodes or so are one hell of a plot roller coaster.  I would not be surprised if it broke you and you couldn't stop yourself from watching ahead; I'm not sure I'm going to be able to resist myself and I know what's going to happen.

Let's not forget the emotional roller coaster these episodes come with
>> ARTICLE
Nice speculation there, /u/rascorpia , although of course you don't have enough information to get the full picture yet! I'm very much enjoying your write-ups for this.

By the way, although the show-runners did a great job of making a faithful adaption, it is still an adaption of the original manga. That means all credit for brilliant plotting or clever foreshadowing goes to this lady here: [Arakawa Hiromi](https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=261)
>> ARTICLE
Well credit where credit is due, Arakawa did a great job!

From an old fan, this is quite amazing. I definitely had no idea what was going on at this point. I am not going to spoil, but you hit some things and missed narrowly on others. Well done.

GOOD GOD

[First timers don't read this](/s "HE'S SO CLOSE YET SO FAR")

EDIT: what's even more insane [big spoilers for FMA 2003 and Brotherhood](/s "He actually nailed the Fuhrer's sin in both shows")
>> ARTICLE
The second part isn't that insane, it's very much straightforward (only two logical possibilities left out of, at that point... three left?). But yeah, the fact that he got there is somewhat impressive.

As for the first guess, many first-time watchers (myself included) came to similar theories around that point. Still, it's throughly entertaining watching somebody else do it.
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "He's missing 4 of the sins so far, he suspects who's Greed but it isn't confirmed until next episode, that he managed to nail both sins is not without merit")

Yup. I've been looking for an excuse to rewatch but I've been forgetting for the last week. Gonna use my Blu-Rays too. You know what they say. It's all better the eight time around

There's a flashback to her finding the screw in that episode.

Thanks! Totally missed it... Were there other small scenes at the end in the previous episodes? Or was this the only one so far?

No, this is the first episode with an after ending scene

Thanks. Glad I didn't have to rewatch the endings of the other episodes then.

Armstrong is such a great character. makes me laugh everytime.
>> ARTICLE
Itvwas so disturbing seeing him broken during the war

I agree. It was very out of character for him to act like that, but at the same time it was exactly what his character needed. You realize he's human and has inner struggles that he copes with constantly, despite appearing cheerful all the time.

He is truly best boy

As much as I'm starting to really enjoy this series. I think we should keep it to the original plan with the episode increase only on every 15 episodes. I'll feel terrible and empty after finishing this series so the further the ending, the better. :P

Wow you have a strong will.  I was sick when I watched this series, and marathoned 24 episodes in a a day.

Not really. I'm struggling to not watch the next episode now already. But thankfully I have other anime to watch!

The rewatch posts convinced me to finally pick this up and watch it and ive suddenly found myself at episode 24. Been a while since ive found a show thats so easy to binge watch.

There's a reason it's the highest rated entry on myanimelist

I binge watched both series within 4 days I think. I gotta say I was a little tired of Alchemy by the end. But the ending was amazing.

Well since episode 27 is a recap you may stop at episode 26 and join us with that episode

Doesn't compute. You'll need to watch *at least* 16 hours a day, assuming you watch each 25 minute episode in exactly 25 minutes without a single pause or break, to finish 32 episodes in one day.

Watching 3 episodes a hour = for 21-23 hours you can watch all the episodes. I skipped the ED and Preview.

It is called bad English. :D I should probably remove it because people probably have chosen a version.

*Should I boost the episode count by 1 episode?*

Well as I'm already on episode 38...please do!

I'm back again. Running a bit late today but whatever, you don't own me!

**Episode 4**

* Major is so kawaii
* I wouldn't mind owning a house in that town it's giving me real greek vibes
* Of course the Major is a master artist we should expect no less
* Oh man I just noticed the Major was carrying Al still in the crate
* Now Al is a box turned weapon
* "The Great Elixir" ... "The Red Tincture" ... ["The Fifth Element"](http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/5000000/The-Fifth-Element-the-fifth-element-5079562-1918-796.jpg)
* Doctor is right, MC, you probably shouldn't be messing with the ominous looking red stuff
* "The Truth that is beyond the Truth" **2deep4me**
* I love how nonchalantly Al sat through all that
* There we go with the small jokes again...zzz
* Ed was really asking for that punch then
* Woah that dog is actually a RoboDog :D
* [Xx420 BLAZE ITxX](http://i.imgur.com/GnsLkJW.png)
* That Major fan service 11/10
* Major+Grandma, I ship it!
* Al making animal friends as usual
* Holy crap Major going Super Kawaii was probably the scariest moments in the show
* RoboDog gives no fucks in response
* Winry is quickly becoming my new favourite character so hopefully we will see more of her in future episodes
* At least Al has manners unlike Ed
* [Best scene](http://i.imgur.com/i8I3VuA.png) this episode
* Stuck around for the extra scene, will that be reincorporated later on or was it purely there for gag purposes?

I liked that episode, everything was so relaxed and mellow. I guess that means from now on things will start getting heavy? Although from what I'm hearing it's 15+ onward where things pick up so I don't know.

I can see why people want to do 2 Episodes a thread since this will take a while otherwise but I'm not sure how I will keep up. It takes me awhile to do these write ups so once the episode count goes up I might not be able to do them. I'll either do quick 'thoughts on' summaries or deliberately fall behind during the week and then do the 'play by play' commentary in bulk on the weekends. Not sure yet but hey, to the next episode!
>> ARTICLE
> Winry is quickly becoming my new favourite character so hopefully we will see more of her in future episodes

Well you will be seeing quite a lot of her, her role is quite important in Brotherhood (unlike the first anime where she got sidelined).

>Stuck around for the extra scene, will that be reincorporated later on or was it purely there for gag purposes?

Well, it's pretty much just a small scene that plays some small roles in a few of the upcoming episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the response. Nice to know I'm watching the Winry-definitive version of Full Metal Alchemist and I'll keep my eye out for these 'minor' scenes!
>> ARTICLE
I'd go as far as saying that everybody who appears in both FMA versions has the definitive version in Brotherhood, in the original version the best characters are the ones that were made for that version

Alphonse, for example, is really, really lame in that version while in this version he is an incredible character that plenty of times outshines his brother, he's one of the main reasons I never liked the original so much
>> ARTICLE
Winry has some of the best scenes of the show. She is one of the better developed characters in the show, and that says a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Guess I picked my new favourite character well then!
>> ARTICLE
Just you wait, this show has a lot of great characters :) My personal favorite is probably either Armstrong or Roy Mustang. Once you see more about their past you'll understand.
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow are we already approaching Episode 7?  That really went by quick, I can't wait to see what the first timers think.  And we're just getting started!
>> ARTICLE
So far? Typical shounen. Feels a lot like Nanatsu no Taizai (overpowered MC) with a touch of Akame ga Kill (each episode introduces a new antagonist that gets taken care of by the end). Still waiting to see why it's at the top of MAL's list.
>> ARTICLE
Ed is everything but overpowered, did you miss the fight vs Scar somehow? He kept running and almost died in that fight, and Scar is still free so he's still a problem
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but we all knew nothing was going to happen to him because plot armor. And they don't seem too concerned about Scar running loose. They completely forgot about him in the second half and went along on thier quest for the Philosoper's Stone.
>> ARTICLE
I'll do it, not a rewatch for me, my first time watching it :D

 Good sir I will give you some great anime to look forward too, while I agree that there aren't expected to be any new standouts like "your lie in april", there are some great( hopefully) sequels , second seasons, etc.
Tsukimonogatari: Yotsugi Doll
Tokyo Ghoul A
Durarara!!2 Shou

I would say Ansatsu Kyoushitsu has the most hype for a new show.
And then in spring you got Digimon so I don't know what can be better than that.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Ansatsu Kyoushitsu looks great, a friend of mine read the manga, told me this is definitely a show to follow closely this season. And my body is ready for Jojo SC part 2, Aldnoah.Zero 2, Tokyo Ghoul A and Durarara!!x2, just finished these near christmas time. I also look forward to Death parade. 

This season is just absent of any Kill La Kill, Attack on Titan, Fate/Stay Night level of Premiere hype, which Im 100% totally cool with. Could be for the better. 

There's going to be quite alot of time (and would be a great time for) this season for re-watches imo.

Yup! Gundam rewatch soon! I'm getting the details right so I can start it on the 16th(hopefully)

After the TV Series ends. We do 2 ova every day. So yeah.

So I've never seen brotherhood, but I have seen the original FMA. I know Brotherhood was more of a reboot that stayed true to the manga, but I heard that it sorta starts in later in the story. Is that true? And if so, will it make sense? I haven't seen FMA for a while now, so I don't remember a lot of the earlier story points.

No.

I've been trying to finish the part of the series that's on Netflix before it gets removed on January 15. I won't be watching alongside everyone else but maybe I'll check in on the discussion.

They have the rest of the episodes subbed on hulu (ironically those are the only episodes they have).  The only way to watch the series dubbed and subbed legally is on Funimation's website but you may need a subscription.

FMA:B is available for legal streaming subbed or dubbed for free on AnimeLab in HD. All of the episodes are there. But you need an Australian IP address to watch it. Nothing hola or a VPN can't solve if you really want to watch it without going to the other places on the internet. https://www.animelab.com/shows/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood 
>> ARTICLE
It's times like this where I'm glad I bought the DVD. 
>> ARTICLE
You mean Blu-ray.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, DVD. I don't have a blu-ray player. Besides, FMA was animated in 720p so that the budget could be more evenly spread. Watching on a blu-ray would make a marginal difference.

EDIT: Okay, I get it, blu-ray quality is not close to DVD quality. Please stop telling me that. 
>> ARTICLE
Not true. It has mostly been explained to you already, but there is even more to it, such as upscaling to 1080, and done very well. Also, DVD is only 480p, so it isn't the full quality anyways.

If you have or want a new video game console, they are blu-ray players anyways, and plain blu-ray players can be pretty cheap now-a-days too.

Source: I have a few
>> ARTICLE
In that case they upscaled it the right way, because it looks pretty good.

720p is 2.66 times the pixels of 480p. Depending on viewing distance and screen size it can be a very significant difference.

Nothing to worry about guys. They'll probably renew. I'm sure FMA:B is making too much money for them to drop, they'll definitely have it back up shortly after (a week or so).

Edit: Sorry I added this late, but Netflix commonly renews their licenses with popular anime. For example, Samurai Champloo has been renewed for the past 2 years or so. I'm sure FMA:B will be the same.
>> ARTICLE
wait, they took it down, then put it back up, never got the entire thing either time, and now they're taking it down again??!!
>> ARTICLE
Good thing it's available in my blu-ray player whenever the fuck I want.
>> ARTICLE
haha nerd so fagy uu paid sooo much money for a useless dvd player and probably 3000 for a big tv that plays in 720 lmfao and ur mad n wanna feel like it wasnt a waste to buy all that bs just to have it... but u did and its a waist of ur time n money haha
>> ARTICLE
It's not there for me :( I was checking yesterday to see If they uploaded the rest of the series but nope instead they got rid of it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i'll stick to the DvD/blue-ray.
>> ARTICLE
All the subbed episodes are available free on youtube under Funimation... that's how I got into anime lol.

Not sure about regions other than the US.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately some are missing. For example [nothing comes up when searching for episode 5](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fullmetal+alchemist+brotherhood+sub+episode+5). Looks like the original series is available, but not Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing this is for US netflix. I can't see anything that suggests it's going to be taken off on the UK one.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes, for US. Didn't realize Netflix was available outside the US now.
>> ARTICLE
We also have Season 5 on UK Netflix. Still on my to watch list. 
>> ARTICLE
Not even there for me anymore.  Oh well.  Glad I nabbed the BD Collection 1 and 2 when it was cheap-ish.
>> ARTICLE
Time for a rewatch then.
>> ARTICLE
Wait what episodes are missing? My friend just watched Brotherhood but said it was kind of confusing, how many episodes are missing?
>> ARTICLE
When I checked it looked like random ones were missing. Episode 5 missing but then episode 6 looked like it was there, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure this isn't going on in Canada (I'm currently watching it) 

So for Canadian fans: don't worry about it

To be clear I did read the title, I'm just clearifying
>> ARTICLE
No, it's true in Canada as well. If you check the site, you'll see the expiry date on the Brotherhood page.
>> ARTICLE
I hate Netflix so much. They drop all my favorite movies and shows. They don't even carry the ones I want to see. The only ones they have now are the ones that are too bad for people to actually want to buy.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
No, you can't share them here. Fourth rule, do not link to/mention torrents, unofficial streams, or downloads. Mentioning that they exist is arguably fine, but don't talk about the places where people can find them.
>> ARTICLE
netflix.com/woody gives you one free month of netflix if anyone is interested!
>> ARTICLE
Seeing these news makes me mad. Ugh. I want to watch from a site like Netflix, but nope.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck Kyle
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that nightmare was nightmare enducing^^^hah

Not that It is to relevant to this specific episode, but am I the only one having a hard time not continuing beyond the 1 episode a day?
>> ARTICLE
~~You will be missed comrade. Only the strong will be here!~~ I meant that if it is difficult this early. You will have a problem. :P
>> ARTICLE
Phff, I didn't say I wasn't going to stay LOL. Just that it was hard. I think I might just watch FMA(2003) for that juicy extra backstory.
>> ARTICLE
You should! The original is pretty good. The part with Tucker and creating a chimera from his daughter and dog is more fleshed out as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, I'm struggling too. Every time that ED starts, I instantly want more.

But I'll probably manage to stick with the program.
>> ARTICLE
Just letting you know, I have you tagged so you can't see more than one episode unless it's said otherwise
>> ARTICLE
Yup, so far I'm still on target, if I make it to episode 15, I'll probably be fine.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry. I am also having that problem. Something to look forward to though right?
>> ARTICLE
> Oh great! And now my arm's come off cause my brother is a big fat idiot!

Damn that line is fantastic!

Is it just me or does Scar seem more powerful in these earlier episodes than later in the series?
>> ARTICLE
I took it more like everybody got better before the next encounter

I also think that Scar actually got stronger later but the problem comes [](/s "when characters like Wrath are that much stronger and others like Father are completely immune to his attacks since he doesn't know what Father is made of")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, how people actually scale is pretty wierd. Now that I think about it most of his later(like waaayyy later) enemies are damned strong compared to ed and all atm. I only wish we had more action with Mustang since there is never enough of the Flame Alchemist.
>> ARTICLE
>I only wish we had more action with Mustang since there is never enough of the Flame Alchemist.

Ed and Al are pretty damn strong, but I'm almost certain Roy is the strongest [Spoilers](/s "fully human") alchemist in the series.
>> ARTICLE
Or at least he has the most combat-effective specialisation. I can imagine that the Elric brothers might beat him in more abstract tasks as their adventuring tests their skill at improvising and using diverse approaches more than Roy's military background and desk job.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like in a raw out explosion of power, Mustang is difficult to parallel among living state Alchemists. In ingenuity, creativity and problem-solving, the Elric brothers have Mustang beat.

I do agree that I wanted to see more Mustang though :(
>> ARTICLE
[In the original](/s "didn't Edward and Mustang fight? If I recall correctly, it was a close fight and ended in a draw.")
>> ARTICLE
[Episode 13 of FMA](/s "If I remember though, wasn't it a mock fight? It was pretty short, but I remember Mustang having flashbacks to the Ishvalan war towards the end of the fight, at which point Ed held his arm blade towards Mustang neck. Bradley then steps in and calls it a draw.")
>> ARTICLE
[Light spoilers](/s "Yeah that's what happened. Mustang would probably win 1v1, but if both the Elrick brothers fought him, I think he would lose.") 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, its time for the fifth one today! Lets go!

That nightmare was something else. I won't post screens of it but crap, it must be a real hard burden. Luckily I myself dont have frequent nightmares but I do feel sorry for people who do. Ed realizes his hypocricy towards Shou when confronted about his own human transmutation.

Just in light of the whole muslim-conflict going on in the real world the similarity to the fight in the town invoced by the priest and that bitch is just too much. [People are tricked and upset waaay too easily.](http://i.imgur.com/Ac3fEl8.jpg)

Oi, badglass vs our hero, [the fight we've been waiting for](http://i.imgur.com/vdaiLFQ.jpg). Amazing. Ed's 100% into being the perfect main char, giving up his life for his brother and stuff. But, of course, hes not alone - [World famous Alex Louis Armstrong](http://i.imgur.com/2MwYM0y.png) reporting for duty! I knew this guy before I even watched this series LOL. Sadly we dont have a winner (yet), so of course we're gonna watch the next ep.

[I hope everyone knows what these words](http://i.imgur.com/pCGvn73.png) actually mean. Even if its right, its never right to die for it, no discussion. Sometimes, being alive is the greatest gift. Few are able to accept it, sadly.

How awesome, we're actually seeing more of the famigerate civil war and the girl from the Elric's past is also gonna show up! Definitely hyped for the next episode. The series a bit of a lacking background soundtrack, but definitely makes up for it with the rest of other awesome content. Cya next ep' bois!
>> ARTICLE
Welp I'm at episode 10, I'm surprised I managed to resist this long. 

[ep 10](/s "and yes it is raining")
>> ARTICLE
Great action in this episode, It's good seeing an MC be vulnerable.
>> ARTICLE
Day 5! Or more like Day 3 for me...love the fan art today :D

**Episode 5**

* Well that was creepy. MC needs some meds.
* Now that I think about it Esdeaths sister kinda looks like Asami from Avatar (please don't shoot me /r/anime)
* Woah so that was a chick pretending to be the priest?
* **Wait** that's a [*dude*](http://i.imgur.com/tVC3b0n.png)? My brain hurts...
* [*HE*](http://i.imgur.com/GzXgpoI.png) is the guy who killed mustache dude  </3
* wuuuuuuuut Al just got torn up yo
* wuuuuuuuut Ed just got torn up yo
* "You're impotent on rainy days, after all"- The way she delivered that line, so cold...
* Scar even looks good dodging bullets
* Maybe he wouldn't have been able to dodge your fist if you didn't announce yourself beforehand
* Mr.Muscle sure does get philosophical when he strips
* Wow Al's uppercut! Not even subtle
* [m..m..mustache dude?](http://i.imgur.com/3OUKeLT.png) is that you?
* Maybe I'm supposed to feel bad for all those people that got killed in the civil war but the fact that mustache dude was involved means all crimes are forgiven. **GLORY TO THE EMPIRE!**
* Looks like the MC is ready to kick some Scar ass, Simba style!

Another day, another episode down. At this point I'm eager to see mustache dude avenged but at the same time I don't know how the show can best itself after that is done. *We shall see*.

[Somewhat spoilers](/s "It could be say none of these people with the ouroboros tattoo have genders")

>> ARTICLE
[spoilers](#s "Well, if you are talking about Wrath, he IS human, depends on how you see him. However, the one pictured here alongside Lust is Envy, who was never a human (unlike the first anime Envy)- in fact Wrath's the only human hommunculi, other that Greedlin who comes in quite a bit later in the story.")

It isn't any gender. You have no clue how it can best itself. You don't even.. xD
>> ARTICLE
> You have no clue how it can best itself. You don't even.. xD

Haha something tells me you are waiting for a particular story arc to see my reactions.
>> ARTICLE
I completely forgot how the ishvalian war was shown the first time, certainly a later scene was that much more memorable while using the same techniques 
>> ARTICLE
If it is possible to answer this question without huge spoilers:

Why is only Ed able to repair Al? He said he was the only one able to affix a soul to an armor... That means no one else was able in history/no one tried? Or simply: he affixed it, he is the only one to do it?
>> ARTICLE
>Why is only Ed able to repair Al? 

Because he's the only one he trusts to not damage the seal.

>He said he was the only one able to affix a soul to an armor... That means no one else was able in history/no one tried?

Not as far as he knows.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you very much
>> ARTICLE
I swear each episode is better than the last.  What a great episode and show so far. 
>> ARTICLE
To think this is considered the worst part of the show (although it's mostly because of the insane rush to cover 30 episodes of the original show in 10 episodes and plenty of people watched the original show)
>> ARTICLE
Lets just say that the good part hasn't even come.
>> ARTICLE
Day 5 of a show that shouldn't be in the MAL top 10.

That nightmare proved this show wasn't ready to tackle its problem seriously.
>> ARTICLE
upvoted because all you want is downvotes
>> ARTICLE
Okay so I decided to do a bit of a copy-cat action of /u/rascorpia, even though I've already seen this show.

**Episode 34**

* I love how they actualy thought about the mechanics of cold-resistant metal.

* More Winry? :D

* Al's bald! D:

* Olivier's kind of a dick

* Gasp! Major Miles is a minority!

* Miles is my favourite North-character. "Your casual racism amuses me!"

* I get how Ms. Armstrong is supposed to be this admirable person...but she's
such a scary character :/

* THAT'S NOT HOW SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST WORKS. ALSO WHY DON'T YOU USE ALCHEMY TO
GET RID OF THE ICE.

* A new challenger appeared! 

* Sloth is probably the one of the few characters where I prefer the japanese VA.
Probably has to do with the fact that my first anime was Bleach...Kenpachi ftw.

* "He just threw a giant metal pipe around. I'm sure a few wooden crates will stop him"

* Olivier's a dick. But she's a smart dick.

**Episode 35**

* ["Drive closer I wanna hit it with my sword!"](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091011115912/warhammer40kfanon/images/thumb/c/cd/Drive_me_closer_i_want_to_hit_them_with_my_sword.png/500px-Drive_me_closer_i_want_to_hit_them_with_my_sword.png)

* Nice! Wet T-shirt contest!

* Nice! Cold T-shirt contest!

* From all the Homunculi I always thought Sloth was the saddest. Gluttony's an
idiot but atleast he's happy.

* Miles Vs. Kimbley oh yeah. Also wtf is up with Miles' sideburns? Seems like
they wanna poke his eyes out.

* Gold-tooth is worst character.

*Alchemist confirmed for earthbenders.

* Izumi confirmed for best character.

* OOOOOOOH THEY'RE DISCOVERING THE THING 

* Hey look it's the prologue guy. 

* I don't know who I hate more, Kimbley, Gold-Tooth,...some others.

* Olivier's fishing for Raven. Raven's taking the bait.
* *one milli-second after I typed that*: Ed and Al: "He took the bait!"

* Can't wait for next episode. I *think* that's the one that introduces one of my favourite characters.


>> ARTICLE
You've done me proud! 
>> ARTICLE
I still expect a write-up of episodes 34 and 35 tomorrow. These are vital episodes of the show as they not only show how badass the northern wall of Briggs is, it also has one of the biggest reveals in the show.
>> ARTICLE
I just wanted to use these episodes to point out how well they show how it feels to have metal in you. I have metal rods in my back, and the way he reacts to rain and cold is, to me, very realistic. 
>> ARTICLE
>You Ishbalans burned down my hometown.

Wait what? Was this ever mentioned before?
>> ARTICLE
Nope. Not before, not after.
>> ARTICLE
They do mention that the the war spread out and resembol was just to the west of Ishbal, so it should've been one of the place affected. 
>> ARTICLE
It didn't seem so though. The only burning we ever saw was the Elrics burning down their house. 
>> ARTICLE
We're never really introduced to Resembol at all though. Hell, if it wasn't cause of other scenes, of someone told me Resembol was only two houses and mountains of graveyards I'd believe it. 
>> ARTICLE
/u/rascorpia come back, we need you, you haven't seen these episodes
>> ARTICLE
Sorry guys on a night out so no post tonight. I'll make up for it tomorrow I promise. 
>> ARTICLE
No worries, have fun!
>> ARTICLE
Well, I can't wait for first timers' reaction after certain reveal tomorrow
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I did feel like something big was gonna come up tomorrow, especially since suddenly *that's* when OP decided we'd watch 3 episodes a day.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, you would've watched the reveal tomorrow anyways
>> ARTICLE
I think he meant that we are going to start watching more episodes because the series is about to pick up and get even more interesting.
>> ARTICLE
After reading this, I myself can't wait for tomorrow!!
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been following the rewatch(I just came back from trip so I'll start today) so I'm not sure what it is.  
Is it [Spoilers](/s "Pride?")
>> ARTICLE
Yes
>> ARTICLE
The Briggs stuff really is awesome. I'll freely admit I was compelled to skip a few days ahead once Briggs people started showing up in the OP.

I'll also note that Olivier is clearly a classy and well-brought-up lady as she's trained in the delicate feminine art of tankery.
>> ARTICLE
Hi. I haven't really been checking in on the discussion, but I'd like to thank whoever started this for giving me a reason to start FMA: Brotherhood. Although I can't keep up with the schedule on a regular basis, I'll try to keep up/stay ahead. 

Also, does anybody else thinks Olivier looks a bit like Riza? Just me? Ok then...
>> ARTICLE
Lotta blue-eyed blonde girls in this anime, to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
The eye colour seems to be related to the race here.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed it is, [](/s "which is heavy indication that Ed and Al have different blood in them")
>> ARTICLE
Like I needed a reason to rewatch this... 
But now I can tell myself it is because of you guys!
>> ARTICLE
The penultimate thread is here...apparently we end today on a cliffhanger of sorts so this is going to hurt. Never the less the fun hasn't ended yet. 

**Episode 57**

* The three Ninja's are coming together *teehee*
* People are beginning to realize the true nature of the Fuhrer
* The guy who created the Fuhrer?
* Those dolls trained exactly like Bradley by their style of fighting
* "Shit I passed out" You got cut up man, you can stay down for awhile, don't want you to die.
* NO OLD MAN
* Lan fan where are you
* "A king exists for his people" and his people exist for him ;_;
* King Bradley didn't even bat an eye lid
* No don't talk like you're both going to die ;_;
* Here is everyone struggling to kill any of them and then there is Hawkeye just killing them left and right
* Aww yeah they met in the middle. It was no coincidence, the ship gods ordained it.
* Satsuki doesn't know it but if she had been asked that question with the knowledge that the mohawk bear is dead...she would still give the same answer ;_;
* It's happening!!!
* We were promised and FMAB has delivered
* Figured it wouldn't matter where they were so long as they were in the city
* Didn't see the fifth sacrifice but people assured me it had already been established that Mustang was the fifth so not really expecting a surprise.

**Episode 58**

* Huh mustang didn't go with them, although evil doctor man did assure us that he would go eventually, wonder why the delay
* Like falling into water will hurt him
* Spartans, prepare for glory ;_;
* Greed would be a good contender for best sin actually
* Hughes ;_;
* She is totally going to find Wrath in water before brutally slicing him to death
* Satsuki being a hardass
* WOAH WHAT THE HELL HAS HE DONE TO HOHENHEIM
* Absorbing Hohenheim is sure to work against him later
* Will Al be getting his body back? *HYPE*
* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
* FUVDGKGSGFDHFDJDJGS
* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
* ;_; 
* What...what am I supposed to do with my life now? Is it even worth living anymore?
* FUCKING USE SPACE MAGIC OR SOMETHING MUSTANG! IF YOU LET HER DIE I QUIT!
* SAY YES YOU BASTARD
* WHO CARES ABOUT THE COUNTRY?!? HAWKEYE IS WORTH TWO COUNTRIES
* "I will" DAMN FUCKING RIGHT

**Episode 59**

* Um? She is kind of bleeding out here whilst you monologue guys...
* MAYMAY YOU BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BEING YOU CAN USE HEALY MAGIC, RIGHT??!
* That Philos stone getting kicked around everywhere is like something straight out a comedy show
* MAYMAY CHOOSE CAREFULLY RIGHT NOW. DON'T MAKE ME JUMP THROUGH THE SCREEN AND KICK YOUR ASS, IMMORTAL OR NOT
* God damn [don't ever do that to me again ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/WrS6cGM.png) my heart can only take so much
* Oh great, *he*, is here. Convenient. 
* Gracia it's time to show up.
* Madam President would also be a good character to show up here, unlikely though...
* Well how they trapped Mustang was pretty awesome. So with Wrath no longer able to regenerate he will be the one to die in order for him to go through the gate? or is the doctor enough?
* OH SO NOW YOU BAIT HAWKEYE DYING BUT THEN SWITCH IT WITH MUSTANG? FU
* Pride is just going to eat you my friend. He is a hungry motherfucker
* Maybe not then
* WHAT? HE CAN NEVER SEE HAWKEYES FACE AGAIN? HOW WILL HE BE ABLE TO SEE HER IN THE WEDDING DRESS? AAAAAAGGGRRRHHHHHH FU FMAB
* Truth is a meticulous bastard. It seems like he almost wants Father to succeed 
* For Armestris!
* Fir Ishval!
* For my brother!
* Oh is he going to have to give up his body in order to return to Ed?
* So he is coming back in armour. Problem I see is that his body is rejecting his soul a lot now. I don't know if it will last until/after the final confrontation. Human Al seemed to know that which is why he looked so defeated imo. 
* Well he explains that it is because Al was the necessary 5th sacrifice. A fair point. Then again MayMay could have just been forced through it like Mustang so maybe he's thinking a bit of both

**Episode 60**

* Nothing like a good side character ship to fill the intermission
* "Eye of Heaven, gateway of Earth"- Seems as though we will get the country sized circle this episode
* '[1v1 rust scrub](http://i.imgur.com/5Xu8e6I.png). I'll rek u, swer on me mum' 
* 'Quit using hacks noob'
* Scar is some kind of genius and I've yet to figure out why
* RECONSTRUCTION IN YO FACE
* Time for some duel of fates!
* Hughes family better not get devoured FYI
* "The centre of the world belongs to me" Greed is too good
* I want to see this massive eye
* HOOOOOOOOOOLY it's even crazier than I imagined. 
* NOOOOO don't kill everyone ;_;
* Winry ;___________;
* There is going to be a way to prevent these peeps from properly dying, I'm sure
* WOAH HE IS HUGE
* By the looks of it, you already are a part of him, bro
* Well every exploded, 10/10 great story, when is the next rewatch?

Ah that cliffhanger wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Still want to see the conclusion but at least it wasn't some end like Winry/Hawkeye/May/Fan clutching Eds/Mustangs/Alphonse/Ling's dying body. 

Tomorrow is the last day. I'm hoping for tons of ship focused fanservice, the ending is second only to this. 

Make me proud FMAB, you asshole. 
>> ARTICLE
> So with Wrath no longer able to regenerate

Wrath never had any regenerative ability. Well, good luck killing him though.

>"Eye of Heaven, gateway of Earth"- Seems as though we will get the country sized circle this episode

Why do you think today's rewatch ends on this episode?
>> ARTICLE
> Wrath never had any regenerative ability. Well, good luck killing him though.

Oh yeah, forgot that.

> Why do you think today's rewatch ends on this episode?

Because we decided to do 4/4 in the other thread :P
>> ARTICLE
I am currently watching Fullmetal Alchemist and I gotta say the first 20 episodes are way better than FMAB. The pacing is way better. But the alchemy is shit. It is like magic and not like it is in FMAB. Go ahead and watch FMA after this. It is worth it. Don't listen to other people it is different enough to watch it. :P
>> ARTICLE
will there be an official rewatch? :)
>> ARTICLE
Don't think so, unless someone does them. I am second shift now.
>> ARTICLE
Will do! I'm moving onto the manga next and then the original series, then I'm replacing parts of my body with auto-mail...
>> ARTICLE
And be sure to transmute your family.
>> ARTICLE
That? Please...I did that episodes ago!
>> ARTICLE

* "The return of the Fuhrer" thisisgonnabegood.jpg

* "Jeremiah was a bullfrog, was a friend of mine. Couldn't understand a word he said but i'd help him drink his wine"

* EAT YOUR OWN BLOOD FATHER

* oh crap, is like, the room his container?

* OH WRATH'S GONNA FUCK YOU UP GOOOOOD

* I have to say this is probably one of my favourite scenes in this entire show.

* BUCCANEER ;_;

* WE GREED VS WRATH NOW

* I like how the splash screen said "King Bradley". not Wrath.

* Selim is probably fine Ms. Bradley.

* Seems like Wrath escaped with the help of quick time events.

* This has to be one of those occasions where Greed's shield is way to overpowered. Guess we're not gonna use it then!

* Smoke bombs! NINJA MUSIC. I KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS

* Old vs. Old! LET'S GOOOO

**And now for the new stuff**

**Episode 57**

* Ninja start! Why is Wrath so awesome?

* izumi is sporting quite the tank top there :D

* Shit sure is happening

* Lan Fan nooooo your shoulder D:

* Bye Wrath :c you were my favourite one

* Fu ;_; atleast Ling survived the bullet

* Ling's gonna rock and roll. Is he ever going to use his face-shield?

* Oh there it is. I was wondering about that!

* YOU KNOW YOU COULD'VE USED THAT IN THE FIGHT WITH WRATH

* I love it when the homunculi show emotion...but fuck do i love their displays of power

* I love Buccaneer's death speach in the outtakes but it's way to long to write down here

* Buccaneer deserved a good life with a girlfriend and everything :c

* Wait were we supposed to know those old people? 

* That old general guy can go suck a dick

* Mr. Ho isn't looking very well.

* Father looks horribly scary

* MAY CONFIRMED FOR BEST CHARACTER YOU RESCUED WAIFU #2

* oh fuck me it's Wrath

* You know how Greed has that little soul-form he has? that's just his giant red face? I wonder what the other sins look like in that form.

* I'm guessing Lust had a little soul-boobage

* Wait wtf who hit him

* OH FUCK IT'S PRIDE I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT HIM

* OH GOD CAN SOMEONE PLEASE SHOOT HIM

* THE DOGS DON'T EVEN LIKE THIS DEVELOPMENT

* ALSO THE ECLIPSE BEGUN

* Is this like allegory for rape?

* "I'll be looking forward to the days those eyes will be wide with agony" Nice forshadowing Lust.

* Pride isn't *looking* very good himself.

* I like how Father is just casually standing there

* "Tell me, you go by scar, what's your real name?" "Jugemu Jugemu Gok-no surikire Kaijarisuigyo-no Suigymatsu Unraimatsu Fraimatsu Kuunerutokoro-ni Sumutokoro Yaburakji-no burakji Paipopaipo Paipo-no-shringan Shringan-no Grinda Grindai-no Ponpokop-no Ponpokon-no Chkymei-no Chsuke"

* WE WRATH VS SCAR NOW

* Al your bod ain't looking so well

* Al x Al I ship it

* That cliffhanger. Glad I can just keep watching!

**Episode 60**

**The one where shit gets reaaaaly reaaaly real**

* The radio building plot? really? that's where you're gonna start this episode?

* IT'S BROSH X ROSS I SHIP IT

* Can someone please tell this poor woman the truth

* not THE truth though

* We May vs. Father now?

* We Ed/Al vs Weak Pride now?

* I love how weirdly polite Father is.

**Day of Black Sun Confirmed**

* How can anyone *not* think Wrath is the best homunculus

* OH SCAR'S DUAL-WEILDING

* Don't you talk about Winry splash page she has NOTHING to do with this. 

* Oh no he has a face gun?

* ...does..does it shoot faces??

* I don't even care about Ed vs. Pride anymore, I wanna know about the face gun

* We only have 8 minutes to defeat the fire nation!

* Real life eclipses are totally weird. Only seen one once. Shit's weird yo.

* HOLY SHIT SUDDENLY GREED WITH SCARY HORROR MUSIC

* Aw fuck they're assaulted by evil global warming

* I wonder what happens when youre like...2 meters over the edge of that circle.

* EVERYBODY DIES THE END.

**BAD ENDING**

* NOOO WINRY YOU LEAVE HER ALONE YOU MULTI-EYED ASSHOLE

* This is some evangalion shit that's going on. I guess that's why we have the other rewatch going on?

* damn what a cliffhanger. Glad i can just keep- no...noo! I CAN'T KEEP WATCHING. CURSE YOU /u/xArDDe !

Three-toed sloths are diurnal(awake during daylight) and Two-toed are nocturnal.

I just finished episode 60... yeah, I'm not putting up with the cllifhanger. I'm finishing this today.

And here I was thinking I could follow the schedule to end.
>> ARTICLE
You are really mean with today's cliffhanger. But, I like it.
>> ARTICLE
Don't you love it when your enemy is half-dead, and you still think fighting him is suicidal?

Also, Episode 60 definitely ranks up there with [FFVI 1st haf ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oywecZc0kY) and the [Chrono Trigger Bad End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_BUaKN3is) on the HSQ scale. As for Father using the people of an entire country, I guess it's only matched by plans to drop an entire PLANET.

Greetings...not going to be able to post in tomorrows thread but because I am ***SUCH*** a nice person I figured I would do all 4 episodes for today and tomorrow in one post! 

If I catch a free moment I might be able to respond to comments (tomorrow that is), either way I'll be sure to link this post to those desperately missing my reactions tomorrow.

Senpai noticed you /r/anime

**Episode 30**

* Mustang wasn't the only flame alchemist. Seems like his tutor was a cool guy
* [Guess that means](http://i.imgur.com/2lLBke4.png) I have been dead awhile
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH His master was Hawkeye's Dad? That just makes me want to ship this even more. 
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH what is with Hawkeye's back??
* Really happy about Hawkeye getting more character development.
* [Executive order No. 3066](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2014/032/d/5/execute_order_66_by_mandospartangirl117-d74be7f.jpg)
* ***BASQUE GRAN HYYYYYPPPPPPEEEEEE***
* Normally at this point I should hate Basque Gran but given that all the other alchemists, even Mustang and Major, are involved I guess it can't be helped. Plus you know, mustache.
* Hughes ;_; All you have to do [Steins;gate](/s "is reverse the microwave text messages and pretend to be dead when they find you")
* This is the part where you say Hawkeye is what keeps you going, Mustang!
* Your twisted logic does make sense psycho, twisted sense that is 
* Loving the transition between narrators
* Ah so that is why Kimblee is so powerful he's all high on philosophers
* Wrath seriously need to die. I won't accept his death by any other hands but Mustang or Gracias
* "If this world is based on the concept of equivalent exchange, as stated in alchemy, then we must carry corpses and cross the river of blood in exchange for the new generation to live in happiness" - Damn this is why I love your character Hawkeye
* [It's happening!](http://i.imgur.com/8TH09Tj.png)
* 'Vengeance' Scar 5: A good day to Scar Hard
* I'm running of Die Hard films here guys

**Episode 31**

* [Ahem](http://i.imgur.com/GJdGmsr.png)
* "and...my *queen*" YEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHH
* Is this a brothel? Is Roy seriously a regular at a brothel? Please tell me it's true
* Is it just me or does Ed look a lot...I don't know...'buff' now?
* Dr.Nox has done some shit
* Oh shit the Scar/Kimblee showdown is coming. You are not prepared guys. Well maybe /u/Illidan1943 is.
* "There is something strange about this countries Alchemy" Could that mean that one of my earlier predictions was true? That the Scar people did have something special to them? I'm also guessing that each country has underlying differences in how their alchemy works which is why Father couldn't nullify May and Scar in their fight last thread
* Well that is one way to hide his face, Scar

**BONUS ROUND**

**Episode 32**

* [EP32](/s "That Grandma/pa is definitely up to something")
* [EP32](/s "Oh man it actually is a Grandpa")
* [EP32](/s "I love how the Major literally just parted the shelves rather than go around them")
* [EP32](/s "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH IS THAT EVIL LOOKING WOMAN MAJOR ARMSTRONG'S WIFE/RELATIVE???")
* [EP32](/s "Maybe Armstrong settled up north after the Ishabal conflict? Hence the /wife/cousin/something")
* [EP32](/s "King Bradley is going to pissed at his son for this")
* [EP32](/s "Even more small jokes. I had a dream...")
* [EP32](/s "The scene at Wrath's house...*awkward*")
* [EP32](/s "No doubt that Wrath is going to take this as a threat and not a genuine coincidence")
* [EP32](/s "Scar and Scar 2 are on a journey to the west")
* [EP32](/s "After credits scene of this episode. To the north we go!")

**B-B-BONUS ROUND 2**

**Episode 33**

* [EP33](/s "Russian hype!")
* [EP33](/s "Stop teasing the Scar/Kimblee showdown and just give me it")
* [EP33](/s "Oh man here it is!")
* [EP33](/s "Que Duel of the fates music")
* [EP33](/s "YOU KILLED HIS BROTHER, NOW DIE")
* [EP33](/s "NO. NO. GOD DAMN YOU FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST I WANTED THAT FIGHT SO BAD AND YOU SPLIT IT INTO TWO PARTS GRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH")
* [EP33](/s "Will we see Lady Armstrong this episode? So teasing me :(")
* [EP33](/s ""I would have been killed by Winry before I froze to death out here" :D")
* [EP33](/s "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH IT'S HIS SISTER")
* [EP33](/s "Man she really is Satsuki Kuryuin, sword and all")
* [EP33](/s "Another after credits scene? these are getting quite regular")
* [EP33](/s "Stop saying ominous things like that Marcoh, you're scaring me :'(")

So that is four episode done. Please kill me now. Then again it will be nice to have a break tomorrow, not that I won't be doing anything though. Feel free to link this comment to people looking for it in tomorrows thread. Also feel free to point out anything I didn't comment on, doing these takes hours and it wouldn't surprise me that I missed something.

So, it seems like we're finally going north. Cental and the surroundings were getting boring.

* [Even Riza can see it.](http://i.imgur.com/7pFA5O5.jpg)
* [Don`t be in such a denial.](http://i.imgur.com/6yYVjvu.jpg) 
* The two Riza eyecatches are interesting- her turning from [an innocent girl](http://i.imgur.com/gM1VmR9.jpg) to [one forever scarred by the war](http://i.imgur.com/Doeq4Lu.jpg) [Kinda NSFW].  
* 
* So that scene with Basque WAS left out.
* [I think May just found a new crush.](http://i.imgur.com/9OfLyTH.jpg)
* [Well, that's the end for Marcoh.](http://i.imgur.com/MDO4LTj.jpg)
* [Or is it?](http://i.imgur.com/wGaxzNB.jpg)
* [Ed's drawing...](http://i.imgur.com/iUoR8ky.jpg)
* [Ed returning the favour.](http://i.imgur.com/4w6JxZp.jpg)
* The anime left out the part with Roy calling a girl right after letting off Ed and Al...so much for not worrying Riza.  
* I wonder what info Roy passed to Madam Christmas...Xiao May's drawing, or whatever there was in that chess piece?
* [Yup, that's Kimblee.](http://i.imgur.com/F0PyGOE.jpg)
* [But not the anime Kimblee.](http://i.imgur.com/c6f8poH.jpg)
* Well, Scar does have a nice idea- people don't know of Marcoh as having a disfigured face.

>> ARTICLE
Honestly considering this show has an extended epilogue, I can live without the scenes cut from the anime
>> ARTICLE
They really don't affect Brotherhood- just some scenes I feel interesting to mention.
>> ARTICLE
First of all: Damn, that fanart! Is it really made by a fan because it looks official.

So Riza and Roy have innocent blood on their hands too. And what's the deal with Riza's tattoo? Wait, don't tell me! I'm sure all will be revealed in due time. 

And noooo! I was looking forward to Winry making the automail for Lan Fan. But looks like that won't be happening. 

Kimblee is EVIL! But Scar is always one step ahead of the enemy. Disfiguring Marcus so nobody recognizes him was a smart move. Will he be able to discover the secret behind Alchemy in his brother's research before he faces Kimblee and the power of the Philosopher's Stone in an ultimate showdown?

Roy is upto something again! A Mrs. Christmas huh? This sounds familiar. And nice motivational trick there Ed - holding on to something with a promise to return it when they reach their goal, only to borrow it back again to motivate them to work towards their next goal. I'm gonna have to try that with someone!
>> ARTICLE
> Is it really made by a fan because it looks official.

I'm also wondering this since I remember seeing it a long time ago
>> ARTICLE
Its not fanart. A lot of the art of the day OP has posted has been official promotional art.

Picked this rewatch up way to late- Started 3 days ago and I'm only at ep 17 :S Can't wait till I'm caught up though, it's so much fun to read all the theories from first timers! (shout-out to /u/rascorpia, his/her prediction skills are amazing)

In case you guys missed it, they are also giving away Black Butler S1, Steins;Gate S1, and Devil is a Part Timer! Get them before they're gone!

Yeah, but to do that, I'd have to go on the Windows store.
>> ARTICLE
So basically just everything which is on UK Netflix lol?

do you have links? I see other ones as having free episodes, but when I searched steinsgate only found ones that cost money.

Thank you for the links. I have Brotherhood on BD and have seen it plenty of times. But Black Butler and Steins Gate look interesting and if i can check them out for free and give a middle finger to Aniplex at the the same time, that works for me.

thanks!

There's also FMA movie for free, but only as a rental (for 2 weeks):
[Fullmetal Alchemist: Conqueror of Shamballa](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/movies/fullmetal-alchemist-the-movie-the-conqueror-of-sha/8d6kgx04fgqq)

Do you know of any other anime that they are giving away? I also saw season 1 of Fairy Tail for free.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I forgot Fairy Tail! Those are the only ones I've seen so far. But Fullmetal Alchemist wasn't free yesterday while the three I named were, so they might be adding them every few days. There's no easy way to check though. You have to actually check every anime on an individual basis. So far they've all been Funimation Dubbed Season 1's though, so that can narrow it down.
>> ARTICLE
Curious guy here but why are Microsoft doing this? It's pretty awesome, actually. It'd be pretty cool exposure if people oblivious to anime decided to take the opportunity of free cartoons
>> ARTICLE
> To play videos, you need a web browser that supports Silverlight

>> ARTICLE
I honestly didn't know Microsoft had an online streaming video service like Amazon, Apple, or Google.  ;)  Well, I did know via Windows Media Center, but I totally forgot about it.  (I uninstalled all the app crap from Win 10.)  

Great way to try and get people to use their streaming service, but it's so far behind Apple and Google now.  Hell, Google Play lets me play all my purchased videos directly from Youtube so I don't have to worry about the video app that people are having trouble playing these free anime from Microsoft.  There's no way Microsoft can compete with Google Play for me, but I'll take the freebies anyway.  ;)
>> ARTICLE
Microsoft is targeting our demographic.

In general business theory and in general for our demographic that's a good thing:

1.  It's a win for MS because it gets younger demographics acquainted with their store and service.
2.  It's a win for our demographic because the fact that we are targeted means we are "important" and that other businesses and such will also target us as a priority.


However, I will do my best to ignore it because I don't particularly like Microsoft moving into the general entertainment retail business.  Too much of a spread-spectrum *zaibatsu* in that sense.  I don't need or want a Microsoft monopoly on my life -- they already have my desktop OS, office productivity, and have inroads on web browsing and several other things.  They need to stay out of digital entertainment retail.
>> ARTICLE
Giving away free stuff at a store is a great way to gather interest for their other paid products. Along with the other effects such as branding and all other positives. 
>> ARTICLE
Also, if someone has a large library of products from a certain seller, they are often to come back and want to add to it. By giving away free stuff, the windows store is making their store known and establishing an inventory for users that they can add to by paying.
>> ARTICLE
They're also selling a lot of season 1's, get people hooked so they'll pay for future seasons.
>> ARTICLE
The freaking dang shopping psychology.

Also if you are new to buying digital anime content, this is their way to hook you up to their service as windows and xbox user.

>> ARTICLE
I didn't even think about that, but it makes perfect sense. I've always considered getting digital content on Google Play because it seems easiest to me and that's where I have my established free-content library. Now that I have a few shows on Microsoft and know that they have good deals, I'll have to start considering them for the sake of consistency with my library.
>> ARTICLE
I can confirm this. I never knew Microsoft Store sells anime, or anything other than software.
>> ARTICLE
Feels like a continuation of their old Zune store, in regards to media.  I bought Samurai Champloo from there years ago.
>> ARTICLE
http://i.imgur.com/Ma572Nq.jpg
>> ARTICLE
I seriously want that branding over here.
>> ARTICLE
Nice, almost wonder if this one in particular has to due with Funimation's expiring license. Would be a decent screw you to Aniplex of America.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the same thing. Though, considering how they're also giving away Steins;Gate, Black Butler, and Devil is a Part Timer for free, odds are they just chose an older show that they knew people would want.
>> ARTICLE
I give them props for actually knowing their customers. 
>> ARTICLE
I suspect it was Funimation's decision, or at the very least their input. None of their newest popular shows are free, like Attack on Titan or Tokyo Ghoul. They know people will be more likely to pay for those, especially now that they have a few shows in their Microsoft library.
>> ARTICLE
In case you're also having trouble finding them. (All dubs by the way)

The Black Butler one is probably useful to some Canadians who want to watch it since it only has season two on Netflix. Don't know about other countries.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! You da real MVP.

Oh wait, they're all dubbed, not subs? hmmmm
>> ARTICLE
Disappointing.

>> ARTICLE
Good find. Though a bit limited. May be good for deciding if you want to continue watching a series. Though all of these are available on Netflix(Canada) except for Bloodlad and Tiger & Bunny. Thought about watching Bloodlad for a while so I may check that out.
>> ARTICLE
I suggest giving Bloodlad a watch. It's not too long and quite entertaining. A lot like Blue Exorcist in a way.
>> ARTICLE
Is this dub only? 


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, all of the shows that they're giving away at the moment are in HD, Dub only.

FMA:B Actually has a really, really good dub, but I can understand if you'd rather have the sub. Both are excellent.
>> ARTICLE
I can't help myself. I'm a sub only elitist asshole. Kinda wish you would have told me before I got those totally free shows which I'll never watch, now. :( But take all the upvotes, sir.
>> ARTICLE
Aww man, that sucks. I used to be sub-only, so I know how you feel.
>> ARTICLE
I don't hate dubs but at this point I've been watching subs for three years and watching a dub just feels off. 
>> ARTICLE
The last time I watched a dub was when I was 12 years old..
>> ARTICLE
i don't really watch dubs either , but i like to use as replacement for podcasts on my second second screen
>> ARTICLE
I know that feel. I go back and forth a lot and then the other looks weird. I find I usually *prefer* a dub at this point because I noticed that I seem to empathize with the characters more, but I probably watch more sub just because of simulcasts and the like. Even so, whenever I spend a lot of time watching just subs or just dubs the other feels weird when I switch to it.
>> ARTICLE
My rule of thumb is basically: 

* Did I watch the dubs of this as a kid? If yes, probably dubs
* Am I doing something else that requires the use of my eyes? Dubs(or if terrible dubs, watch something else)
* Otherwise, subs
>> ARTICLE
I'd say that's fair.

Watching the Sub version of something like Yu-Gi-Oh! or Pokemon just isn't the same, even if the dubs are cheesy 
>> ARTICLE
>Watching the Sub version of something like Yu-Gi-Oh!

Though saying that, if I could find subs of Battle City that weren't in broken english, I'd totally watch it, just to see the original before 4Kids butchered it. 
>> ARTICLE
Now that I think about it, I tend to watch subs while on my laptop, but almost exclusively dubs while on my couch watching on the TV.
>> ARTICLE
Where would we get or fill of desu desu if we only watch dub?

https://youtu.be/FkVYHUMCCwc
>> ARTICLE
You make a damn fine argument. I concede victory over to you.
>> ARTICLE
hey man please try it. I am a 95% subs kinda guy but I guarantee this dub is worth it. Especially since there aren't any Japanese names for the American voice actors to screw up. 
/u/bigfatround0 I reccomend to you as well
>> ARTICLE
Is it the same voice actors from the first one? If so I might watch it dubbed then. 
>> ARTICLE
I know Alphonse has a new VA cause his previous one grew up (think it was a kid dunno). However the new actress is really good and sounds almost the same!
>> ARTICLE
I might watch the dub then if that's the only difference. I actually liked the dub for the other anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the rest is the same from what I am aware of. And all of the voice actors for the new characters match them perfectly, even when they sound totally different from the Japanese actors. It really is one of the best dubs you can find.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, Aaron Dismuke was 14 when he voiced Alphonse in the 2003 series. The decision to cast the new VA for Brotherhood was based almost entirely on the fact that she naturally sounded like him. She had never seen his work before and was not allowed to so she wouldn't try to consciously emulate him. Source: Some panel I saw a few years ago.
>> ARTICLE
This is such a calm conversation about dubs and subs I love it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll be the riot one.

I like to watch my subs with dub!
>> ARTICLE
Subs with Dub? I *would* if Funimation, Aniplex, and Sentai bothered to have subtitles for their English scripts instead of just their Japanese scripts. That decision makes no sense to me.
>> ARTICLE
When i first started watching Anime, the first things i watched were Naruto and Bleach. I started off with the English Dub because i was like 13-14 and thought reading subs was for nerds (i wasn't a very nice teenager).

I have since moved onto subs but recently decided to watch Bleach, fired it up on Netflix and the dub version automatically started.....I didn't realize how dreadful dub can be until that moment.
>> ARTICLE
english dub with japanese sub is the only true way!
>> ARTICLE
I like that they keep releasing these freebies, but I prob won't ever buy the rest of the seasons. And FMAB is on netflix.
>> ARTICLE
For now. It's leaving soon. And besides, they don't have the last season.
>> ARTICLE
Hulu has what Netflix is missing. One could easily finish it using a trial period. 
>> ARTICLE
True, but Hulu's also likely to lose it when Funimation loses their license back to Aniplex.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I know. I just meant, for those trying to get through it on Netflix before the expiration, Hulu is the only way to finish it for free, if one is quick about it. 
>> ARTICLE
I suspect it will be back soon. Aniplex has made deals with Netflix for a lot of their other shows like Fate/Zero and SAO. I imagine eventually they'll work out a deal with Netflix for FMA once Funi is out of the picture. I have nothing to back this up, it just makes sense considering the size of the show and their past behavior.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I hope so then
>> ARTICLE
I had not gotten that far on my rewatch yet. Crap.
>> ARTICLE
I finished what they had on Netflix a while ago. I really got into the show but realizing they didn't have the rest of the show made me lose my interest. I need to get around to finishing it. 
>> ARTICLE
For anyone outside of the US: Just switch your region to United States in system settings. I was able to download everything with my non-US account.
>> ARTICLE
That's awesome! Thanks for the tip. I'll keep that in mind if this happens again but with another territory.
>> ARTICLE
I've grabbed all of them...

Anyone know of a way to play these outside of Windows apps? I'd like to have them in my MediaPortal list...
>> ARTICLE
it doesn't work with other apps aside from movies and tv 
>> ARTICLE
Oh that's cool.


> To play videos, you need a web browser that supports Silverlight

Or not.
>> ARTICLE
Laaaaaame.

Wow someone downvoted me. Really? Who the fuck uses silverlight (whatever the fuck that is, never had to use it) or internet explorer in 21st century? Show yourself :D
>> ARTICLE
I think I had to use silverlight a couple years ago to watch a stream on cbs.

Yeah dumb to have to use these.  I couldn't even purchase any of the free stuff from Chrome had to open the links up in Edge which then opened them up in the Store app.  Not the smoothest transaction.
>> ARTICLE
> Edge 

Just googled it because I had no idea ms made new browser. Results were really depressing.

>> ARTICLE
Weird. I purchased them from Chrome no problem. Though I do need to be on Edge or the app to watch them.
>> ARTICLE
Silverlight isn't an actual thing you (the user) use, it is a thing the program you use uses.  Kind of like how most games require direct X.
>> ARTICLE
I see. But unlike direct X it looks really niche. I think during my entire life I saw maybe 1 message that I need it to display something and I said 'fuck it' and closed the damn thing. So yeah, installing the thing used by program I won't use anyway is a waste of time :P
>> ARTICLE
You can play them in the browser? In my case, it just asks me to install the video app...
>> ARTICLE
Or windows 8 or 10.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, this is one amazing dub to an amazing show. Glad they added this too. Although, if there's one thing I love more in the sub, it's how they say Fullmetal Alchemist: HAGANE NO RENKINJUTSUSHI!
>> ARTICLE
My biggest struggle is that I love the cast of both versions enough to constantly be wishing I was watching the other version instead. The voice actors really outdid themselves in both the dub and the sub.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is like that for me too, I played the VN in Japanese and I'm watching the anime in English. The dub is great... with the exception of a few glaring things. Moeka's voice is terrible. The meme references, especially from Daru, are really silly (even though the original frequently mentioned 2chan memes too.) Mayushii doesn't sound *worse,* but definitely has a very different personality to her voice. And worst of all, _they cut out all the JoJo references that the VN had._ 

_ALL OF THEM._

The English script is really well-done, though, and **_HOUOUIN KYOUMA_** and Kurisu's voices are pretty damn spot-on. But the original ***HOUOUIN KYOUMA*** was the glorious Mamoru Miyano... so it's a struggle.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, I am head over heels for the Steins;Gate dub. I can't watch it subbed now. Moeka's voice is an acquired taste. Usually she's pretty ehh, but when the show gets to the scene with her and Okabe alone in her apartment she's great. Kurisu, Ruka, and Suzuha are fantastic as well, but everyone is outshined by J. Michael Tatutm as Okabe. His role as Okabe is probably my favorite dub cast out of anything I've seen. He just nails it perfectly. 

Mayuri on the other hand is a different case. I *love* her voice, but most of the people I know who like the sub more hate it. The problem is that she feels like a different character in the dub, which doesn't really fly for most people. I think she did a great job though.

And yeah, the English script is perfect. Okabe's voice actor is actually the one who wrote it, which might be why he does it so well. And you're right, the Japanese version had our lord and savior Mamoryu Miyano, but I dare say that I liked J Michael Tatum's take on the character more.
>> ARTICLE
I like dub Mayushii just because she sounds more believable as a real person who might actually exist. In the original she's just an endlessly saccharine beacon of moe tutturu that can't be stopped.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's a good way to put it. In the Dub she's still a bit of an airhead but still feels real, which is why it's far more believable that she could actually be aware of things at times.
>> ARTICLE
The Steins;Gate VN had Jojo references? 
>> ARTICLE
Tons.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say this is quite a good strategy. Not as obviously clever as offering Steins Gate's first 12 free but I found Brotherhood's first half significantly more compelling than its second, so it's pretty much a win-win for Microsoft and the fans.
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming this doesn't work with windows 7? can't seem to find anywhere to download it.
>> ARTICLE
I think it might only work on Windows 7 if you're using Internet Explorer :/
>> ARTICLE
That might be the case, when I opened the link my Microsoft Store popped up. Never used it before....
>> ARTICLE
It's not working for me :\ 

When I'm logged in on chrome it shows the episodes in my TV page but when I go to the same page in the app it's not there. when I try to open the episodes from chrome it opens the app it says "Sorry we couldn't take you there. try again later". 

I searched for FMAB in the app but it didn't come up as free and I tried searching for Steins Gate and nothing came up. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm on Windows 10 and couldn't purchase from Chrome either.  Had to copy/paste the links in Edge which opened them in the Store app.
>> ARTICLE
but on chrome is shows that I have "purchased" it and it's in my library, it's in the app that it doesn't show up. 
>> ARTICLE
Weird. Worked on Chrome for me.

I was able to add it using Win 10 OS on the Chrome browser.  I have the latest Chrome version (48).  Try logging into Microsoft first, then going to the link.  Also clear your entire browser cache.

worked with firefox O.o

Are you in the US? It might not be free in other territories. Also, make sure you're looking at the Dub version, because the sub isn't free.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, Australia. Guess that might be it then :\ damn
>> ARTICLE
Someone else pointed out that you can change your territory to U.S. without making a new account. Then, after you "purchase" the shows, you can switch back.
>> ARTICLE
thank you for the news. I will be taking it.

Thanks. I downloaded the HD version, its 720p and each episode is almost 1GB (whole season is about 22gb). It also only plays on the microsoft app. I had no luck playing it on VLC. All dub.

How to download off the store?
>> ARTICLE
[Open the app, select the episode from your library, and hover over it to reveal the download icon.](http://i.imgur.com/8FQJeyW.png)

Does this work with Xbox One?

You should be able to stream them to your Xbox One as long as you're using the same Microsoft account. I'm not sure if you can download them and put them on a Flashdrive to your Xbox One, but I assume it would work.

Ooo free stuff

Just started watching the series again a week ago fml

If it's free, then I can't complain. ;) Thanks for sharing!

I've never bought anything on Windows Store.  What does this actually mean - they get added to your account, and you can download at any time?  Does this work on Windows 7 or do you need a Metro OS?
>> ARTICLE
They are tied to your Microsoft account forever for both streaming or downloading purposes. It sounds like you might need a Metro OS, though an Xbox should work just fine for the purposes of watching. I haven't tried to see if you can "purchase" them from an Xbox or not.

Hmm, looks like I should be able to play them through a browser, but getting a "try again later" error even through IE.

I remember getting the Fairy Tail ones, but it's watch only. Any way to download?

Yeah, you should be able to download them. Though it sounds like you're restricted to using their app in order to watch them even while offline.

They all do. Netflix uses silverlight too.

Come early April, no. License is expiring, and AoA will be holding onto the rights hereon.

Sub or dub?

It says English audio/English subtitles so I'm assuming it's the dub, but it could be both? The dub VA cast is better in any case.

Not gonna argue with you. I prefer japanese sub, mainly because i'm not english and I like how japanese sounds.

Thanks for sharing OP.  The manga/Brotherhood storyline blows the older FMA away.  Required watching, or reading, for any otaku.

I know it's windows based, but is there anyway to put these episodes on an iPhone?

Microsoft doing this makes me feel less guilty about having torrented (and kept) most of these great Anime.

Well, hang on to them because Microsoft's anime and media have huge restrictions especially with regard to what you use to watch them with.  Even though I have Win 10 and their TV app, it forces me to log into my Microsoft account on the app to watch them.  Then they will keep tracking me even when I'm done.

Hey everyone! I just want to preface today's discussion by apologizing for any drop in the quality of my write-ups. I've been fairly busy lately and these write-ups take quite a large chunk of time to do. If I know anything about working when tired it's that the quality is the first thing that suffers. If any of you reading have been disappointed by my more recent posts, I'll try and put more effort into my future ones. 

Additionally I would like to say that , despite my apology, if I get too backlogged by missing threads I may have to give more brief commentary on the episodes in order to catch up (8 episodes for two days missed is an unrealistic amount for me to do write ups on), though I have no current plans that  would cause this to happen so don't worry. 

Without further ado...

**Episode 34**

* Although I do like this OP I can't help but wanting 'Kono omoi wo' back
* Looks like this new mechanic/doctor would get on well with Winry *hint hint* (bring her back to the forefront of the show please)
* I realize this is a bit of an odd question that probably doesn't have an answer for, but is counterfeit silver pocket watches a problem in the fullmetal universe? It seems like most people are pretty quick to accept the legitimacy of one but to me there doesn't seem to be anything about it that would make it hard or impossible to make copies of so it makes me wonder. 
* Only had a short introduction to the doc but I like her. Lets hope the rest of the new cast is of the same quality. I'm also excited about the suggestion that Winry comes up to the North. No doubt this will mean she crosses paths with Scar again.
* Ah General Armstrong is so much like Satsuki it's unreal. Can't help but feel that Trigger took some inspiration for kill la kill
* The wall is the only thing that stands between the State and the white walkers
* I wonder why Ed said something so confrontational as 'You Ishabals' when he knows that the murder of the rockbells was perpetrated by a grief crazed Scar
* Very interested to see if we find out what the inscription on Armstrong's blade reads
* OH MY WUUUT THAT'S SLOTH
* Satsuki you need to use the sicssor blade to cut the life fibres!
* Poor Sloth :( He's just trying to do his job and here he has people wanting to poor fuel on him

**Episode 35**

* Woah that dude must be insanely strong to be able to flip sloth when 3 tanks of full speed could only just push him back
* Satsuki is pretty damn smart with that plan
* Miles laying down the law to kimblee. The men of the nights watch answer to no man but their fellow watchers on the wall
* Wait a minute. Is sloth literally craving out an alchemy circle that is the size of the entire country? And here was me thinking that the alchemy circle was just going to be the size of the capital
* The way the tunnel scenes look just makes me appreciate the production values that were behind the creation of this show. It looks amazing for something that is around 6 years old now
* I figured that the wars that had occurred under King Bradley were manufactured ones but I didn't expect it to be on such a large scale as this
* Briggs is the last domino to fall. The revolution starts here and Satsuki will be the one to lead it!  
* "I thought about torturing it out of them, but I'm technically a woman, too" - Keep being great Satsuki
* Huh...an immortal army...I realize they've pointed at this before but I still haven't wrapped my head around it. If it's just the sins that are being referred to then I would struggle to call that an army. If it isn't the sins then that is very interesting indeed. Is Father going to use the mega powered philosophers stone to make an army of humunculus? but then to what purpose? Who would be left to oppose him in that case? Maybe this is just the lie that the inner circle of generals has been told to manipulate them perhaps...

**Episode 36**

* Huh. So unlike the sins Hohenheim actually memorizes the names of the people within him? That sounds like an awful lot of names to remember if you are practically made out of the red stuff. If Hohenheim is also a 'perfect being' like Father and he was the one to create Father then was his situation a result of his creation or was Hohenheim himself created as a perfect being?
* Could Hohenheim himself create sin-like creatures? I hope this episode begins to answer some of these questions
* "I've witnessed many deaths since **gaining** this body..." That is very particular wording there. So from this we can insinuate that Hohenheim was not 'born' imbued with the Philosophers stone. The question still remaining however is whether he became as he is from the creation of Father or through other means
* Seems to me that Hohenheim is sick of being the one to watch people die. Could I be right in believing that he left home to become mortal and age with his family? Granted that wasn't my initial guess but I got there a few episodes later...right...guys?
* Oh hey we might get to see that picture that we have been teased about in one of the OPs
* Best Mom/Wife
* Awww he's crying...I want to be happy but now I'm also sad :( 
* I guess this was the moment that triggered his quest to die with his family. Good a reason as any, I just find it out that he didn't seem to really give two shits after seeing Ed again. He obviously loves his family but does he really care more about dying with his family than living with them?
* Seems like he is finally close to becoming mortal. He seems to be moving around with little direction though. Does this mean that time is that catalyst to becoming mortal and not any missing 'ingredient'
* Also can I just mention that Sloth has done a monumentally good job for someone of his name sake?
* Shit son is that Pride? I would say the eye thing is similar to Envy but that thing was like a shadow rather than a physical thing. 
* I've said this before but I really can't fault people for mistaking who the fullmetal alchemist is. If you are going to give yourself a name at least pick one that is more uniquely recognizable, you are really not fullmetal, alchemist
* Ed+Al are pretty good actors, even if Raven is easy to deceive
* Satsuki just went full on Mafia on Raven. I find it slightly odd that she chose to turn down a seat at the inner circle which could have got her more information. I also find it odd that if she was just going to kill him, why did she wait until now after the hole is sealed and sloth is free to do it? Other than having an awesome send off line she didn't really gain anything from waiting since Raven still didn't reveal anything new
* Winry's back :D 
* Winry is back :/
* Huh. So Satsuki does think Mustang is important after all. Wonder why she said she didn't care before.

**Episode 37**

* Episode title is 'The first Humunculus',  I wonder if that is a reference to Pride being the first sin 
* Talking about a girls dead parents makes for great small talk
* Winry is going to be so pissed when she learns the connection between Kimblee and Scar
* It's only a small thing but I like how you can see the characters reflection in the car window. I can't actually think of many anime that go out of their way to add little details like that
* Wonder what Ed is needed for that doesn't require Al...very suspect
* Speaking as a Northerner, Northerners are the best
* Mustang took that 'take a hike' remark surprisingly well
* The caves have eyes...*coming to selected cinemas near you*
* WWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
* Pride is Selim? I don't even...so that letter about how proud he was of his Father was more than just a cute little kid thing!?!? Why the fuck is such an innocent little kid murdering people in tunnels? Is it just while he is sleeping or what?
* Does he have a split personality? Man I don't understand anything anymore ;_;
* Wait if he is the first humunclus then not only is older than his 'father' but that also means we his a lot wiser than he lets on. Why the hell does he idolize the Elric brothers then? They must be like children to him, there is a hint of irony behind it really
* I swear there was some subtle eye signals going on there. Ed and Al have something on their minds...
* Player 3 joined the team! Winy :D

**Episode 38**

* All my favourite characters are getting screen time. This show is reading my mind.
* MayMay & Sir Alphonse ship is on full speed
* Finally I can find out who the fuck Yoki is. Took the show long enough, I actually thought I had missed an episode
* I seriously hope we see the millionaire family again. It was like they were all Major Armstrong
* When will people realise that Scar is like the fullmetal version of Chuck Norris
* I'm kind of surprised Ed and Al didn't try to negotiate with Scar first in order to get him to decipher the research notes. Surely if you capture him first you lose your ability to learn the alchemy you wanted to know about, other than what MayMay can teach you
* Satsuki is too much like Satsuki, especially with the watch scene
* People fall off the wall all the time...ravens death was nothing suspicious
* Ending scene for this episode seems to be setting up for Winry & Scar to settle their differences. Maybe after that we might just get the Scar+Elric tag team of ultimate awesomesauce

Well I have high hopes for the pace of the show going forward. It has never been too slow so far I'm just excited to see the pieces start fall together now. Hohenheim better show back up again soon or he will be relegated to the final few episodes which would suck. Either way it's nice to see some of my theories be confirmed but even better to see a reveal that had completely blown over my head. 

5 Episodes for you /r/anime, you better be happy!

If you are also interested in my comments on NGE, I'll be doing those now so be patient. That will be episodes 4&5 so it will probably take an hour or two to finish. It's not like I'm doing this because I like you or anything...baka!

>> ARTICLE
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought General Armstrong was totally like Satsuki in every way.

You mean 4,5 episodes.

Never mind though :P

How about "keeping them separate"?

>Why the hell does he idolize the Elric brothers then? 

Because Selim is supposed to be a nice young kid. A new look by itself is an useless disguise.   

>there is a hint of irony behind it really

How about this bit of irony: the oldest Homiunculus living as the young son of the youngest Homunculus.  
>> ARTICLE
> Because Selim is supposed to be a nice young kid. A new look by itself is an useless disguise.

Still seems a bit weird to me. He was never on anyone's radar before his fan-boying over the Elric brothers. He himself actively went out of his way to see the Elric brothers and bring them home with him so I think there is a bit more to his actions than just disguising himself. 
>> ARTICLE
The sins have been interested in the Elric brothers from the beginning. Perhaps his idolisation just makes it easier for him to keep up with everything they do without causing suspicion.
>> ARTICLE
Did someone mention sloths?
 Here's a random fact!

Sloths make for excellent survivors. Of the five species of sloth, only one is currently endangered: the Maned Three-toed sloth.

He meant that he's the first homunculus created by father

>Finally I can find out who the fuck Yoki is. Took the show long enough, I actually thought I had missed an episode

Actually, the show did skip the chapters where he's introduced, in the 2003 anime this is covered in episode ~~4~~ 9, to give you an idea, episodes 1 and 2 cover the Cornello story and episode 3 is essentially the same as episode 2 in Brotherhood, thankfully the studio knew exactly what they were doing since that story can be considered mostly filler they retold it in a humorous way
>> ARTICLE
> Wait if he is the first humunclus then not only is older than his 'father' but that also means we his a lot wiser than he lets on.

I was meaning Wrath here. Probably should have made that clearer. 

So Yoki is one thing the first anime did better. I feel it would have been brilliant way to handle filler material if only they had told us about him much sooner than they did. 
>> ARTICLE
It's actually episode 9. Episode 4 is the one with the zombie.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I don't remember that much of the original show
>> ARTICLE
Wanted to do another write-up since I had so much fun with yesterday's. Note that I have already seen this show before, so no crazy theories from me.

**Episode 36**

* Well this episode certainly starts interesting.

* Thrisa (Thrisha?) is awfully okay with all of this.

* ;_; This *fucking* show

* I wonder how much Hohenheim actually told Thrisha. She might've been one of
the most knowledgeable characters in the show, if not for the fact that she died.

* longest cold open so far? that was like 6 minutes until the OP started.

* Hehe, "cold" open. Because we're in briggs. It's cold there. *hehehe* 

* not even gonna comment on those soldiers.

* Olivier's a dick. Raven's a bigger dick.

* "Pride explained it to you, didn't he?" Interesting...

* Knocking those guys unconscious and leaving them without clothes in the snow
*certainly* won't kill them!

* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH SHE DID IT OLIVIER IS REDEEMED I FORGOT ABOUT THIS

* goddamn she is one cold-hearted badass

* Please kill Kimbley as well while you're at it.

* wtfwinry I forgot about this. Kimbley why you so charming

* I thought this was the episode where we got to see Pride- Instead we only... saw Pride. You know what I mean.

* After credit scene :D Mustang confirmed for Spy?

**Episode 37**

* Ooooh is this gonna be the episode where we see Pride in full?

* Point is; I think Kimbley is actually honest about being proud about Winry's parents not abandoning their post.

* Dat dog face. ED HIDE YOUR BONER.

* Buccaneer is jealous? Lol

* That horse ;_;

* Wait why did Pride retreat? 

* This is probably my favourite reveal in this entire show.

* Kimbley might be crazy, but he ain't giving Ed the good stone.

* Can we please cut Winry some slack jezus christ this poor girl.

* Don't worry Winry you can always sit on Ed's lap I'm sure it won't be awkward at all.

* We're starting to thread into territory that I can't remember from my last watch. Really curious what's going to happen

**Episode 38**

* Because one more episode can't hurt, right? 

* Why can't this show leave my waifus alone. Stop giving everyone PTSD damnit

* "This place is to damn big!" Yeah, unlike you Ed.

* "Dr. Marco? you look like shit!"

* Remember that one filler episode of the original show? The one that focused on Yoki but also introduced that one cool alchemist that turned out to be the main bad guy? Well nobody does so here's a recap. 

* [very minor spoiler](/s "Youngest Armstrong sister") can join my list of glorious waifus

* Chimaera's huh? FUCKIN' SWEET!

* Chimaera's huh? AW SHIET

* How the fuck do they recognise their voice with that filter.

* Did he just break his neck holy fuck.

* Hey look it's top tier waifu saving the day

* Some people might object to my use of waifu but it kinda obscures names so I don't spoil anything.

* Olivier's growing on me. As in a "she's a dick but she's kinda cool I guess" kind of way.

* SCAR UNHAND MY WAIFU RIGHT NOW
>> ARTICLE
>Thrisa (Thrisha?)

Tricia/Trisha.

>Did he just break his neck holy fuck.

Not quite, it's a standard move to knock someone out. You can see this move on the movies too.

It seemed more of a "didn't bother".

Today only episode 36 has post-credits scene

We finally learn who's Pride

Tomorrow new OP and the hand porn ending

EDIT: oh yeah, almost forgot: [](/s "We see a little of the rest of the Armstrong family")
>> ARTICLE
Why is it called the handporn ending lol, I really like it but is that why?
>> ARTICLE
I mean, there's stuff in that ending that some harem anime might consider it ultra hardcore
>> ARTICLE
I was just looking through the new OP to warn people of spoilers, but I think that's the first OP of the 4 so far that doesn't show anything that has yet to happen in the show ([except one small thing](/s "Ling fighting against Bradley, hinting at Ling breaking with the Homunculi"), but I think that it's rather obvious that something like this would happen, so I don't really count it).
>> ARTICLE
I think this time it's one of the rare cases that the ED spoils more than the OP, just watch it
>> ARTICLE
You're right, it spoils something from episode 41: [episode 41 spoiler](/s "It shows the two other chimeras' forms and them joining the Elrics as well.") And it's not even subtle, it's pretty clear what's going on.
>> ARTICLE
The story of Yoki's encounter with the Elrics was told in episode 9 of the 2003 anime.

Also, a fun fact: If you look at certain clues during the burglary scene in episode 38 (the sparkle pattern on the entry gates, the women with very manly facial features, the young girl with incredible strength) you'll realize that the mansion he broke into belongs to [mild spoiler](/s "the Armstrong family.")

Sorry guys I won't be doing my first time impressions today. Feeling a bit crappy and I had a busy day to boot so I'm exhausted. If I'm going to do something I want to do it right rather than treat it like a chore, so I'll do episodes 17, 18, 19 & 20 in tomorrows thread.

The fan is CGI, nobody understands why and way back during the original airing a lot of people were confused or mad that it was CGI (it doesn't help that we see it again later)

I don't know if you can answer that but why are so many people mad at studios which include CGI in their anime series?
>> ARTICLE
What people hate is bad implemented CGI, where it creates a huge contrast with the rest of scenes, think Star Wars Episode 1 where it's very obvious some stuff aren't really on the scene

Almost everything today has tons of CGI, but people don't complain about it because they don't notice it but when CGI is bad you notice it almost inmediatly and for some people it takes them out of the scene so that's why it's hated

I see, still, I dln't get why people hate on CGI in Kiseijuu for example. I never even noticed it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think "why" is the issue here. It's easier to do CGI animation than drawing the frames. It just tends to stick out. There's also the Nachtwal thing from the second Nanoha movie that just stuck out as unmistakeable CGI.  
Compared to those, it seems like the Kancolle CGI are done much better, not really sticking out.

[Indeed it does](http://i.imgur.com/WxWhzBw.jpg), but the one in episode 18 is old and broken, the one in the first OP is shiny and new.

Btw did you guys notice that [the blond guy who appears in front of it](http://i.imgur.com/EbRmDmz.jpg) in the first OP is not Ed? He looks like him, but he still has his two arms. I already watched the show several times, but I never noticed that.

Finally, this is where things start to get amazing. Had to seriously fight the urge to watch the next episode.

Looking forward to seeing some first time watchers reactions :D
>> ARTICLE
Oh ho-ho. As someone who has watched the original series, things are starting to get really interesting for me.

1: They actually did something with the whole Envy killing Hughes while dressed like Ross thing. In the original series, while Envy still transformed into Ross, Ross was never implicated.

2: I was pretty damned sure Mustang didn't kill Ross. Glad to see my suspicions were confirmed. Mustang isn't a damned idiot.

3: Barry the Chopper is all around a lot more fun this time around. I guess because they skipped (or the original anime made up) that episode where he did bad things to Ed and Winry. It was kind of hard to like him after that. 

4: All around Mustang's team is getting a hell of a lot more action than the original anime, which is great. Before, they just sort of were always there, but never did anything. 

All around things are looking great. I also accidentally episode 19, which I'm not going to lie, was fucking amazing.



>> ARTICLE
They cut out Barry's best bit from that phone call. When Roy starts flirting with "Bunny" he plays along for a moment because wiretaps or something.
Then, when they call back from the payphone, Barry's all "Don't you dare make me do that again."
Also, is it me, or is that the Hughes phone booth again? Is there just one single phone booth in all of Central?
>> ARTICLE
I assume it's the closest booth to those offices. If Roy is working in the same building Hughes worked in, it makes sense that the same booth would be most convenient.
>> ARTICLE
> 3: Barry the Chopper is all around a lot more fun this time around. I guess because they skipped (or the original anime made up) that episode where he did bad things to Ed and Winry. It was kind of hard to like him after that.

That part wasn't just skipped, the Lab was pretty much the first time Al met Barry.
>> ARTICLE
I'm trying to catch up in time for the discussions. Only ~15 episodes to go :/
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the first OP and ED a lot more than these new ones.

I don't feel any excitement for a new episode with these ones. Though the show itself is still great.
>> ARTICLE
Same.  First OP and ED are some of my favorite in anime... These not so much. 
>> ARTICLE
My favorite intro is the next one. The song is great and the story in the anime is amazing look forward to it 
>> ARTICLE
The original FMA diverges far far from the manga fairly early on, but what it does is fantastic. It's easily a classic, and actually was a great transition for people to anime. it's been said it doesn't have the same "anime feel" which is fine considered how westernized the story itself is (It's practically set in Unification Era Germany). 

Brotherhood does follow the manga and is better made in a lot of ways than the original, but it has that because of how popular and good the first series was. Brotherhood even tends to skip small developments of characters because the studio most people had already seen FMA. 

I'd say start with Fullmetal Alchemist so you know what the foundation of it all is, and then watch Brotherhood to know what the writer's original intentions were for it. the Fullmetal alchemist manga took a very long time to complete. 
>> ARTICLE
:D people like me!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah... you nailed it perfectly. How you described it is exactly how I did it and it was worth doing it that way. 
>> ARTICLE
Came here to basically say this. Couldn't have put it better myself.

Upvotes all around.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks alot for this good post :D
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal Alchemist for an emotional story that focuses slightly more on the characters.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood for a more solid plot and more action scenes.

I wouldn't pay too much attention to the scores on MAL, the majority of the community there is not too great to say the least. I'd personally say that neither series is better than the other and would recommend watching both of them so you can get the best of both worlds.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i know score isn't the best option to judge an anime. Thanks for your  post.
>> ARTICLE
**Fullmetal Alchemist**

* Beginning better developed
* Better soundtrack
* More melancholic atmosphere
* I really hated Wrath as a character
* Somewhat dissatisfying ending (Conquerors of Shambala)

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood**

* Rushed beginning
* More slapstick humor
* Major characters that weren't introduced in FMA
* Solid plot that made more sense to me
* Epic ending

In the end, it really depends on what makes an anime "good" for you.
>> ARTICLE
My one issue, with this is the "rushed beginning" was sort of intentional. As i understand that the creators assumed you watched the original so they kinda pushed you through until the plot shifts. So they did not need to spend twice as many episodes telling the same story.
>> ARTICLE
I know, but for someone like OP who hasn't watched the original series, it's worth mentioning.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, I took in the context of a negative but i am mistaken, either both should be watched imo.  
>> ARTICLE
>Rushed beginning

This is wrong.  The pacing never changed, FMA just added a whole bunch of crap to the beginning to make it last longer while :B didn't.  Every episode animated in FMA:B is about 1.5 chapters of manga. The "rushed" pacing is what the author intended.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they basically expanded on side stories only mentioned in the manga as full episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Can you really consider the movie the ending of an anime? Even if it over half filler? Naruto has had more than a handful of movies and they barely even touch the canon. 

I didn't really care for CoS either, but aside from that FMA ended strong I think. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the big difference is CoS was an additional plot to the main story, where Naruto moives are just side story.  Which is mainly because Naruto is continuing, and FMA had ended.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the reason I watched CoS was because I hoped it would be more conclusive than just ending it with FMA, so either way I was slightly disappointed.

And writing CoS as an abbreviation other than Chamber of Secrets is... strange for me :P
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I loved Conqueror of Shambala.  I thought it wrapped things up nicely.
>> ARTICLE
You know, what with [hitler](/spoiler) and everything.
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's personal taste... The ending wasn't exactly [happy](/spoiler), and I didn't really find it all that fitting. I disliked it for the same reason I disliked [Pirates of the Caribbean 3; I feel that there could have been a happier ending, but for some reason the authors didn't like that.](/spoiler)

Anyway, Brotherhood wrapped things up much more nicely.
>> ARTICLE
To me, it was bittersweet, and that's life.
>> ARTICLE
I just didn't feel like typing it out. bahaha
>> ARTICLE
If you watch both you will get more from it, theres characters mentioned in brotherhood who just show up but had at least an episode about them in the first one.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, thanks Hira !
>> ARTICLE
Came here expecting a shit storm of fighting and bickering, but seeing all the mutual recognition about how both shows are great, it brings a tear to my eye. -sniff- 
>> ARTICLE
They rush through a lot of the early episodes of Brotherhood with the assumption that the viewer has already seen that content in the original.
>> ARTICLE
The following is a copy-pasta from a post I made a few times before (on this subreddit & other forums).

 FMA:B is a great and in my opinion the superior series. The downside is the first episodes were retelling the same story already told in the first 15 episodes of FMA. This obviously isn't appealing to viewers who have already seen it, so they rushed it. This is the only downside in an otherwise amazing series.

However there is a way you can mix and match the series to flow well without many repeated parts, plotholes **I strongly believe this is the best way of viewing.** 

If you want to watch the "better" series without missing out on some of the early FMA1 parts, then do the following:

Watch **Brotherhood 1-2 FMA 1, 2, 5-7, 9 & 13 then Brotherhood 5 until the end**

This will give you the best viewing experience if you do not have time to watch both series in their entirety. You get the emotional character development from the original series, while still getting the awesome plot of the better FMA:B.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks you very much.
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood is a more"grown up" version that follows the manga better. I liked it more then the original but this is just my opinion. I would suggest watching both if it is possible. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice, i'll watch Brotherhood first and FMA later. Thanks baka :P
>> ARTICLE
IMO don't watch Brotherhood first, FMA has almost all of the character building and you'll get more satisfaction out of both anime by watching it first.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed...I would watch vanilla first, then Brotherhood.  I'm also of the camp that liked Brotherhood considerably better than vanilla.
>> ARTICLE
I'll side with uprising by saying that if you're planning to watch both series eventually, start with the original. But if you only want to watch one, I suggest you only watch Brotherhood, or watch a hybrid of both.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this is what i'm thinking. I'll start with BH to know what is the "average" of the story of FMA because i'll maybe just listen FMA in like 3-4 months.
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood is much better for plot since it's following the manga. However I personally liked the original anime a lot as well. Even some of the fillers were pretty interesting and the fact that it loosely follows the series means that you're basically watching two very different shows.

All in all I'd say go with the original FMA first, then watch Brotherhood and decide which version is better. They both are amazing though.
>> ARTICLE
Perfect, Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
They are both very different and both deserve to be watched. Brotherhood follows the manga better. Only because the manga was not finished when the original was made. Hiromu Arakawa the manga writer loved what the show came up with for the ending episodes and movie. 

Anyway if you like one, you will most likely like the other. I have not met many people who didn't like them both. 
>> ARTICLE
This is what i'm thinking after all these feedback :P
>> ARTICLE
Well you've probably already made your mind but I'm going to say watch Brotherhood. As everyone has said, the original diverted so far off the manga and left so many unanswered questions and un-introduced characters. I LOVED Brotherhood, one of the best/beautiful anime's I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I prefered Brother. I hear often though people prefer the first of the two they watch. So if they watch Brotherhood first, they prefer it over the original and vice versa.
>> ARTICLE
I personally enjoyed brotherhood better, but prior to watching it staunchly held the position that it could not possibly be better than brotherhood. I still think that the original FMA had the better soundtrack of the two though.
>> ARTICLE
2 of my favorites animes ever, both imo
>> ARTICLE
I like them both, seeing Fullmetal Alchemist first.  But, I prefer Brotherhood.  I think the story is developed, over all, better compared to it's predecessor, in terms of release date( I know that BH follows the manga almost entirely, compared to when FMA caught up to the manga in production).  They are both extremely good, though.  
>> ARTICLE
Watch them both! I've seen both numerous times and I loved them both. I think both are amazing stories. The thing that FMA:B lacked was in FMA and vice versa. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch Brotherhood if you have an understanding of the basic plot either from the manga or from the original anime.

If you're starting out fresh, then either the original anime or the manga. Brotherhood expects the viewer to know some of the background from the get-go to an extent.
>> ARTICLE
FMA then FMAB... tehKrakken nailed it 
>> ARTICLE
You need to watch the first chunk of episodes for FMA to fully understand FMA:B.

As a rough guide; watch the first until the introduction of Greed then start on Brotherhood, which has a much better ending, as said by others.
>> ARTICLE
I watched both but in my opinion Brotherhood is better. It really just depends on what you like. Brotherhood is a lot closer to the manga but the original has a fairly unique storyline that's actually pretty interesting...
>> ARTICLE
Just read the manga. You won't have to put up with this crap in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Both.
>> ARTICLE
I would say Brotherhood first. It's not a remake, it's another series; FMA had a very different plot compared to the manga, FMA: Brotherhood was consistent with the manga's plot.

Brotherhood and then FMA is how I saw it, and I'm still glad I did.
>> ARTICLE
I saw opinions recommending to watch several episodes of the original and then switching to Brotherhood. I don't remember exact episode numbers though.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say up to 25th Episode, then make the switch to brotherhood.  I watched FMA first, loved it.  Then a few years later watched brotherhood and loved it even more because I saw the original.  
>> ARTICLE
You got it all wrong mate. FMA is practically filler but well put. They were catching up on the manga so they had to continue the story on their own. FMA:B follows the manga completely and is well thought out without plot holes.
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, both are excellent shows with great characters and storyline. FMA is more emotional and has better music, while Brotherhood has a better developed plot and epic battle scenes (though FMA has great fight scenes too.) 

I'd say start with FMA since it goes into greater detail about the Eltic brothers' background and early adventures. Brotherhood assumes that most watching have watched the first anime or read the manga so really rush the first few episodes and skip some things which can put off a newcomer to the series. 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree about the "better developed plot."  It has...well, it has "more" plot, but it's not necessarily better-developed.  Otherwise, I mostly agree.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with watching the first FMA first. It spends some extra episodes that I feel develop the brothers, hughes, and other characters more. It has a more introductory feel to it.


Plus FMA: Brotherhood feels like it's overall better... so I'd watch it after.
>> ARTICLE
If you want an emotional story, watch FMA.  If you want a show about alchemists kickin' ass, watch FMA:B.
>> ARTICLE
Years after and finally seeing the real story end, I can't even look at the first FMA anymore. IMO, if you've been following the story all this time, just watch FMA:Brotherhood. However, the original show is still awesome, it's just that I prefer the manga so much, that I hate watching some "spinoff".
>> ARTICLE
I don't know anything about any of the stories yet.
Can you compare it to like Naruto episodes 100-220 which I fast forwarded through since the main arc story only continued in Shippuuden?
>> ARTICLE
> I fast forwarded through since the main arc story only continued in Shippuuden?

You skipped it because it wasn't in the main story?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but also because they were not part of any story. They were all stand-alone episodes which all followed the same recipe: Mission to somewhere, battle, and return to base. Character development stopped completely. It gets tiresome watching Naruto do the same moronic mistakes over and over again.
>> ARTICLE
Well... the alternative is to watch reality TV on US cable.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I would never go there. I rather slit my throat. Besides, Naruto is my first anime; think I got a few hundred hours, or perhaps thousands of hours to kill ahead of me still.  :)
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood is more like 100-220 of Naruto.

Let me qualify that: They throw in ninjas, there's a little girl with a sentient panda and Scar fights the Monopoly Man.

What.
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen this*, but now I want to.

*This: Naruto or Fmab. whichever one gives him that little car to ride around in.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the Monopoly man, it's the Penguin!
>> ARTICLE
No spoilers please :) . But, thanks for the analogy.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you can do that comparison. I like both series, but if anything, the first one feels more focused. 

> Can you compare it to like Naruto episodes 100-220

I'd say no to a large degree. The only comparable thing would be that those Naruto eps did not occur in the manga, like the latter half of the original FMA. The Naruto filler arcs were there to allow for the manga plot to unfold and thus were only filling out the timeslot. Both FMA animes are serious attempts to tell different stories in the same universe, with one following an already completed script.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the explanation on why they had so many filler, stand-alone episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, the manga was only ahead by 10-20 chapters when the anime finished the retrieval arc. Many also feel that they now are dragging out the fights to avoid the same situation.
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood seems to start midway, so its aimed to the comic readers.
Besides, assuming introduction of the characters has already been done in the first series, no need to repeat the job too much.
>> ARTICLE
Try: Manga, FMA, FMA:B, that's what I did.
>> ARTICLE
FMA then FMAB. FMAB assumes you have seen FMA (or read the manga). The first 13 or so episodes of FMAB breeze through the first 25 episodes of FMA, skipping many details and taking all the impact out of some plot twists. FMA then FMAB. There really is no better way to do it, since *both* series are worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Both are on par with each other, I personally liked FMA better because I saw it first. After watching FMA:B it felt like it was more of a add on ova type filler to me although a well made one at that.
>> ARTICLE
Don't fall for the hype.  Watch the original anime and pretend Brotherhood doesn't exist.  I'm going to get hit with the "but Brotherhood is better because it follows the manga" truck, so let me head that off early.  Just because Brotherhood follows the manga doesn't make it better.  The manga's story falls apart about halfway through and devolves from an interesting suspense/horror/adventure story into a generic, shallow, shounen show.

The characters of the original anime are far better-developed, the plot is more cohesive, the resolution is more satisfying, the pacing is much better, and all in all it's a far more gripping experience.  Watch the first series and then, if you really want to, watch Brotherhood to see an amazing amount of potential squandered.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I can see how Manga readers would prefer an anime based on the manga, but for me, as an anime only kind of a guy, I favour good stories where ever they originated.
I will start with the original then and will most likely continue with Brotherhood afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
The plot of FMA:B is larger, quicker and just generally better.  I have never read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I only watched the anime. FMA:B's plot makes more sense.
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B is better because their no goddamn "real world" and pride is not jewish.
>> ARTICLE
Anti-Semite.
>> ARTICLE
I cried at the end of FMA:B. I did not at the end of FMA.  I'm not sure if I disagree with your points or not, but I had a far greater emotional investment in FMA:B, which makes me think they did a better job with the characters.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand how anyone could cry at the end of FMA:B.  Ignoring the fact that the last episode was dragged on entirely too long, my reaction was "that's it?  That's really the best they could come up with?"

I kind of lost any emotional investment in any of the characters when the story started treating them as plot devices instead of human beings.
>> ARTICLE
Good thing I wasn't the only one who fought back the man tears!
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood is how the author and creator of the Full Metal Alchemist universe wanted the story to pan out, and I personally feel that this is very obvious when comparing the two series. She (the author) knew how the series would end before she started, and designed the characters and the world around the plot that she developed. On the other hand, the original series was kind of spontaneous, being developed by people who did not create the characters and universe that they were working with. I don't mean to discredit the original series as it's still good, but Brotherhood is definitely superior.
>> ARTICLE
The sad part is how people who didn't know how the story was supposed to end still gave it a far more conclusive and satisfactory resolution than the original author.
>> ARTICLE
This. This a thousand times.
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood has better animation, better music, better story, better fight scenes, better characterisation. Don't bother with the original anime.
>> ARTICLE
Better story? Sure, if you thought Final Fantasy VII and Naruto had good stories.

For those playing at home: They didn't.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how Final Fantasy and Naruto come into this discussion... I've never played a Final Fantasy game in my life and I don't like Naruto.

Anyway, yes, I personally thought Brotherhood's plot was more interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
Olivier Armstrong. One of the best characters in the show.
>> ARTICLE
In a show with no bad characters at all, she shines.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, we finally reach Briggs.
Not going to lie, I kind of accidentally the rest of the series two days ago. 
Looking back, I have to the say the whole North Arc, and the way it starts to seriously build up steam was my favorite section of the story.  
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for not warning you guys before, I was busy, both episodes have post-credits scenes
>> ARTICLE
Could it be this show is less popular than Eva? So few comments here and so many on the Eva Rewatch thread.
>> ARTICLE
The threads for the first episodes always have way more posts because a lot of people watch it. Then over time more and more either drop the series or binge it, resulting in less posts.
>> ARTICLE
I'd guess Eva has a lot more first-time watchers, as a lot of people seem to have heard of it but never seen it.

Also, FMA:B is further through its rewatch, so more people are likely to have either rushed ahead and finished it or dropped off because they were busy.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 33, at about 7:30, the shot of Scar opening and closing the traindoor- Am I the only one thinking that would make a great reaction gif?

Edit: I like Buccaneer more then Ms. Armstrong

Out of all these outtakes, I have no doubt that every FMA fan died of laughter after hearing Ed say "I think we should try and bring mom back."

It's like after all the trauma and shit they went through, dodging death from left to right, discovering that you cannot bring the dead back to life, and finally getting their bodies back, they get back right to square-fucking-one.

Holy shit, wouldn't that be hilarious to have a edited version of FMA:B and have this scene replace the actual footage, and just black out? Like no credits or anything, no closure. That's it.

Just imagine people watching that for the first time going: *"Wha- What the fuck? WHAT IS WITH THAT ENDING?"*

First time hearing it, but English dub is real good!



Also fitting since FMA is roughly based on WW2 ish Europe ish world.
>> ARTICLE
The english dub is one of the better dubs that I have found. I recommend giving it a watch!
>> ARTICLE
Frankly I think the dub is better than the sub with FMA and FMA:B, the japanese voice actors really don't fit some of the characters - mostly side and minor characters really, most of the mains are decent.

The English dub however is near perfect, and the performances are excellent.

I didn't like alphonse's english voice for FMA:B
>> ARTICLE
His old VA in the original series was a tad better, but I thought his new English VA did a good job.

See I thought he did a great job, and I really disliked the Japanese Alphonse because it was very clearly a woman doing the voice not a young boy's voice at all.

Wait... that's the actual voice actors isn't it? They really did this?

Yes. This is actually them. There is an intro to the video by Havoc's voice actor talking about them making these outtakes

I don't want to condemn all weeaboos but most weeaboos I've met come off as arrogant when it comes to English dub vs. sub in an anime series. So arrogant to the point where we have people who haven't realized that certain videos related to anime feature English dub outtakes, meaning that it is expected that there is no version of it with Japanese voicing. It's baffling.
>> ARTICLE
Well, with Darker Than Black followed by Baccano, it was clear this was coming. Funimation is losing the license to every Aniplex title they owned one by one. The rights for all of these will probably go to Aniplex USA.

This is a shame. These are pretty big losses for them.
>> ARTICLE
Where can I watch Baccano? Other than the awful funimation site.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't want to know how these discs will be priced by Aniplex USA. Really not looking forward to it. I get that Aniplex will have the legal edge here, but it is still scary. Maybe more shows will be produced by Funimation so they get to keep more shows in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, i'm starting to get worried about what the future of Funimation will be now. I guess they'll have that Attack on Titan money rolling in when Season 2 comes out in North America. But still, FMA:B and DtB are huge losses. That's means that the original FMA will be going soon too.

~~Anything~~ A lot of shows on this list that has Aniplex as "producer" and are licensed by another company(Funimation, Sentai, etc) will not have their licensed renewed. So grab them at a reasonable price now while you can. http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/company.php?id=1257

EDIT: Not all shows on the list, but most of them.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I hope I can get CoS dirt-cheap, and at a reasonable price...
>> ARTICLE
Does this mean I need to go buy copies if I ever want to watch FMA or FMA:B again?
>> ARTICLE
EDIT: ninja'd

Buy what you want now while it's at a reasonable price. Aniplex of America will release both series, but it'll probably be at triple the price.
>> ARTICLE
Damnit Aniplex :(
>> ARTICLE
If you think you'll ever want to own a physical copy now is the time to buy Funimation's version. Aniplex of America's physical releases are very expensive and have small print runs. AoA is very good about having their shows streaming on a variety of services though. It might disappear for a while, but FMA's too big of a property to go away forever.
>> ARTICLE
I've been reading that FMA:B is already missing a few episodes from Netflix though. Which sucks because I started watching it not knowing this.
>> ARTICLE
The whole final "season"
>> ARTICLE
Netflix has the "seasons" 13 episodes long. Is that how many that are missing? :(
>> ARTICLE
Yep.
>> ARTICLE
Funimation has the entirety of FMA:B's run, plus OVA's on their own streaming service. It's possible they withheld episodes from Netflix to draw people to their own site. Either that or it's a weird contract thing that we're not privy to. If you live in a region where Funi's streaming service is available, you can always do a free trial and finish off the show before it goes away.
>> ARTICLE
The last episode available on Netflix is episode 52 (of 64.) They're missing the entirety of Season 5 I suppose. Really bad.

 
>> ARTICLE
Well, that is good to know I just started watching on Netflix.  I do have a funi account also, so I can at least finish it.

>> ARTICLE
What's the OVAs?? I'm on the episode 42 so far, so hopefully I can get to that point before it gets taken. I'm probably going to buy them anyway, since I want to take petty revenge on Aniplex and not pay a premium :(
>> ARTICLE
They're just extra, non-full length episodes that function as side stories. They're nice to see, but not essential. Funi bundled the 4 OVA's together and released them on disc in addition to streaming them.
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty cool. I didn't know about those. Thanks :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Aniplex has nice releases, but they cost a lot. About $10/episode, on average. (And when you consider that FMA:B runs for 64 episodes...)

It's definitely a good idea for people who want it to get it now.
>> ARTICLE
There are many titles where Aniplex is part of the production committee or produced music for a title but do not have international rights. This lack of renewal is only for titles where they have the international rights.
>> ARTICLE
Why is this happening? Can somebody ELI5 for me real quick?
>> ARTICLE
When anime gets released in countries outside of Japan it's because the Japanese rights holders (in this case Aniplex) and a local licensor (in this case Funimation) enter into a contractual agreement. These contracts typically last somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 to 7 years. Once the contract is up, the two parties have the option of renewing the contract for several more years or letting the contract end so the foreign licensing company will no longer hold the rights to release the show. Aniplex is a major player in the Japanese market and hold the original rights to many popular series (Fate, Gurren Lagann, Madoka, Monogatari, etc.). Somewhere along the line Aniplex realized that they could afford to directly release their shows into the American market without needing a middle man like Funimation to do the work and take a cut of the profits. 

tl;dr - A bunch of Aniplex's old contracts with Funimation are expiring and Aniplex has chosen not to renew them in order to release the shows in question by themselves and make more money.
>> ARTICLE
Does this mean season 5 of FMA:B will be coming to Netflix at some point? 
>> ARTICLE
I can't guarantee anything, but Aniplex of America is certainly in the habit of streaming their shows on Netflix. It might take a while to end up on there though. Making the product scarce to build up demand before a re-release is something AoA has done before.
>> ARTICLE
At least now I know who not to feel bad about pirating from. Poor Funimation. I liked them.

Also, does that mean the English dub will just disappear forever? It was among the best, that'll be depressing.
>> ARTICLE
Just a pet peeve,

Pirate or not as you please, I'm not blasting you for that. But the lack of availability doesn't give you moral authority to pirate. Don't pretend that you are pure and blameless when you do.

EDIT: all you downvoters, give me your reasoning please.
>> ARTICLE
Of course, of course! Just a personal decision.
>> ARTICLE
The dub probably won't disappear, in fact I think the way licensing works means that Aniplex actually owns the subtitle track and dub that Funimation produced for FMA. Even looking at AoA's own catalogue, their Gurren Lagann release used the old Bandai dub.

And yes, it definitely does suck for Funimation. I'm sure they really wanted to keep the rights for FMA:B, it was a big title for them.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, okay, that's cool. It'd really suck to see that disappear.

Once Aniplex gets their hands on this, the whole set will literally cost an arm, leg, and [fullmetal spoiler](/s "dog")

>  I also find it sad because the history of FUNimation is so closly tide with that of "FMA" It just dosn't feel right.

That's how I feel about them not licensing Dragon Ball Super. It's not like they were created specifically to bring Dragon Ball to the west or anything.
>> ARTICLE
Wait the didn't or haven't yet licence "DBS"?
>> ARTICLE
To be fair i don't think the Licensed Kai for some time as well. Pretty sure no one else has the rights for Super in North America yet so it's probably just Toei and Shueisha being weird.
>> ARTICLE
Nope. I was telling people that they would for sure license it and dub it. But nope.
>> ARTICLE
That makes no sense. The whole reason for FUNimations existance was just so it could bring Dragon Ball to America no joke.
>> ARTICLE
>  It's not like they were created specifically to bring Dragon Ball to the west or anything.

That's why I said that.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry.
>> ARTICLE
It's almost certainly about money.  Toei is probably asking for significantly more than FUNimation is ready, willing, and able to pay.

It's not like anybody else is going to license it.  Even if they did, it wouldn't make as much money with someone else as it would with FUNimation.
>> ARTICLE
It's much more likely that Toei is expecting a TV deal, which is something that Funimation just can't guarantee right now. Funimation is more than comfortable after the theater sales of BoG and R:F. They want to put Super out as soon as possible so they can get the Blu-Ray/DVD sales, but Toei seems less than interested in the American market right now. 
>> ARTICLE
Mind you they pretty much have a TV deal already (Toonami's still airing Kai and they'd definitely pick up super since it's one of their best rated shows) but frankly I do think it's a matter of DBS just being kind of ass overall,  Toei demanding butt loads of cash and Funi being unsure if the thing will even sell. I mean yeah, it's DragonBall, but it's DragonBall at its most mediocre so the audience might not even be all that for it. 
>> ARTICLE
If Funimation is playing hardball on price then they certainly made the right decision to not pay what Toei was asking. DBS' tepid response will certainly give Funimation leeway to push the price down. It would have really sucked for them to pay an exorbitant amount and then get blindsided with such a low effort show.
>> ARTICLE
I mean the writing has been on the wall for the last week or two, still sucks that this had to happen.

I already disliked Aniplex and this move doesn't help my opinion of them at all, I don't even like FMA that much but this is still such a jerk move. I know it's their product and it's just licensed out but Funi has done so much for them, laying the groundwork to even make it possible for Aniplex to enter the NA scene with their own company and they basically just slapped Funi in the face after all they'd done for them.

I get the logic of this whole thing, but it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about that. Aniplex did the actual funding and production for the show, so if Aniplex didn't exist, the show itself probably wouldn't have either. So disliking them seems to be unfair.
>> ARTICLE
This isn't a matter of creation, It's hard work I'm talking about, Funi dos the grunt work and here comes Aniplex swooping in to take credit and major profit.
>> ARTICLE
Funi does the grunt of the work... what? pardon?

All Funi did was buy temporary rights and redub the show in English. Aniplex produced the original show. Now who did the grunt of the work?
>> ARTICLE
By Grunt work i mean Funi are the ones who did the dub, the ones who advertised who got the show on Tonnami, the ones who made it what it is in NA.

You're right in that Aniplex made the show, but Funi made it what it is in the West and NA specifically. Funi's the one who bored blood sweat and tears into this show in the West, but here comes Big Papa Aniplex to try and take the credit.

Yes Aniplex made the show and are part of the reason for it's success but in the West Funi did the hard work to make it succeed here and Aniplex paid them back after all their loyalty and hard work with a spit in the face and taking their toy back. Cause God Forbid Aniplex be the ones to not benefit 100%.
>> ARTICLE
That makes no sense. If you support a writer and his crew from inception to product finish, does the book printer suddenly have huge rights to the book? Funi is not a publisher. It's a printer. The "blood sweat tears" don't even compare to the blood sweat and tears that Aniplex bore to make this anime come to reality. They take credit because they deserve the credit.
>> ARTICLE
Clearly you and I have different interpretations or I'm struggling to get across my point in a sufficient manor.
>> ARTICLE
With the dubbing and distribution Funimation did, I think they have more a right than Aniplex does to continue distributing it (of course I don't mean legally, but morally) since Aniplex of America is just a distribution company and Aniplex as a whole was still making money off of FMA sales in royalties as far as I know. (Also seeing as how they generally are mainly behind producing the music in an anime)

So really this just will lead to the cutting off of physical sales completely, and I really have a hard time coming to terms with that.

But ultimately, seeing as how Aniplex is a part of Sony, they have way more money to toss around than Funimation does.

Here's to hoping that Funimation gets more into producing anime like they did with Space Dandy so that this type of thing shouldn't happen again in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Their part of the production committee of Dimension W this season so they're already moving more aggressively into that business. 
>> ARTICLE
That's good news. They've played an important part in the anime industry essentially since their foundation, and I hope only good things come from moves like this
>> ARTICLE
Good thing I only have 10 episodes left of FMA:B.. 
>> ARTICLE
So does everyone on Netflix.

Unfortunately, they've been missing the last few episodes for a while now.  We should see if we can sign a petition to try and get them on Netflix so people can watch those shows legally at least.

I wasn't planning on buying FMA:B Dvd's but now I might just have to. :/
>> ARTICLE
Are they only missing on US Netflix? It looks like the UK Netflix has all 64
>> ARTICLE
Yep.  Only on U.S.

And now that Netflix is blocking proxy servers it'll make it even tougher to watch it legally without paying a ton, especially for the dub.

Those who watch dubs are the ones who'll get hit the hardest by these cause Aniplex is doing their best to make sure those don't see the light of day legally, even if it's well-done.  (See: Kill La Kill being found on Netflix/CR/Viewster and others all subs, dubs only available by paying $250 for BD's)
>> ARTICLE
Shit, I better buy the blu-ray soon. ;-;
>> ARTICLE
Aniplex is going to kill the physical disc market in North America. Aniplex taking back all these titles and re-releasing for Japanese-style prices will probably lead to more Japanese companies entering the US market. Charging $300+ for a fully dubbed series. Funimation and Sentai probably have only about 10 years or so left until they become like Discotek and Media Blasters.

Anime is probably going to be the first entertainment medium to truly move to a pure streaming/digital format with the only physical releases being expensive collectors edition. I think that this will happen to all forms of media within the next 15 years, but anime will probably be the first. Since it's so niche.

Just going to throw out my prediction here, so if by some miracle reddit is still around in 15 years, I want to be able to look back at this post to see that I was right.
>> ARTICLE
I notice you haven't said anything about that shift being good or bad, but as someone who enjoys consuming media digitally and who wants to buy shiny quality-looking collector's editions if he buys anything at all, this is the sorta market I'd enjoy. Of course I'd rather pay 100 rather than 300 for a series, but either way.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the situation for American anime purchasers will get as bad as you predict. The only other Japanese company to open up an equivalent to Aniplex-US is PonyCan. Sunrise and NIS now have their own anime products for American audiences, but most of what they offer isn't nearly as expensive as what Aniplex and PonyCan provide. 

Other companies like Kodansha, NBC-Universal Japan, Production IG etc seem to be okay with the current state of North American anime videos/streaming that Funimation/Viz/Sentai provide. The only recent change I've noticed on that front has been slightly more expensive limited edition sets of NBC-Universal shows that Funimation licenses. Maybe they'll eventually change to more Aniplex-style models, but we'll have to wait and see if that happens.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like I'll need to watch Conqueror of Shamballa pretty soon, then.

If you don't know Conqueror of Shamballa is the sequel to the original FMA.  Watching the 2003 series is essential to understanding Shamballa.  (Just putting this out here since many have only watched brotherhood)
>> ARTICLE
I've seen both. Thanks anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's essential, so don't feel like you *need* to.

It's more a case of "I want to watch it at some point, and it's being removed soon, so I'll need to watch it soon."
>> ARTICLE
It certainly helps the ending of the original series though.
>> ARTICLE
I knew it was coming but it still hurts to hear. At least I have the Blu-rays in my collection so I'm good but it sucks for everyone who doesn't collect their favorite anime.
>> ARTICLE
Funimation still will have ownership of the english dub voice track though, correct? So if anyone else picks up the series it'll have new voices?
>> ARTICLE
Interesting point.  Wonder if they would recast any of the original actors or if they'd do a whole new clean slate.
>> ARTICLE
Probably not. Aniplex-US's Gurren Lagann videos have included the original dub made for the Bandai Entertainment DVDs. 
>> ARTICLE
Glad that's the case, hadn't ever heard of something like that happening but know of a few shows like K-On that ended up with 2 versions of a dub so I wasn't totally sure.
>> ARTICLE
Usually when a license runs out the voice acting goes with it to the Japanese company.
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense, I suppose that's why the old Bandai dubs are now being sold by Funimation.
>> ARTICLE
Also note that they can do that before the license runs out.
>> ARTICLE
Bite me Aniplex.
>> ARTICLE
Probably means that shows like Guilty Crown and Black Butler could be leaving soon as well.

Here's a list from u/Lobo_Prime that has all the funi/aniplex licensed titles to plan ahead and snatch up: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/43kn0o/funimations_licensed_aniplex_titles/
>> ARTICLE
I admit that I'm a little confused about this.  Is it just for these two titles?  What about Fullmetal Alchemist 2003, the various OVA collections, or Sacred Star of Milos?
>> ARTICLE
Likely all of it will be gone in time. Some one on the ANN forums looked at the Hulu expiration dates and thinks that Funimation will lose those as well, since the expiration for the other shows Funimation lost lined up with the Hulu dates. 
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait for another overpriced blu-ray. I still can't believe that getting all the episodes of Fate/Zero is around 300 dollars on blu-ray.

If this was some 100+ episode series maybe I'd understand, but 300 BUCKS FOR 25 EPISODES IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS.
>> ARTICLE
Who the fuck actually pays for that? Pfft. I barely buy regular dvds.
>> ARTICLE
The Japanese otaku do.
>> ARTICLE
Thats what Im saying. Nobody in the west is gonna pay close to what the japanese pay for cut up seasons of anime. I still can't believe they even do that.
>> ARTICLE
>Nobody in the west is gonna pay close to what the japanese pay for cut up seasons of anime.

Actually, as it turns out, a very dedicated bunch of collectors do. This is the market AoA is targeting - it fits, considering one of the primary reasons for their existence is to prevent backwards importing to Japan. It's... a very risk-averse model. But it's largely been shaped on the assumption that the disc market will collapse again like it did before.

They make enough money off of those collectors that they make their titles available on all digital platforms though (their website, netflix, crunchyroll, etc.), so tbh I don't mind.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm no collector. Shits too expensive for me. As much as I want to. I dont have enough disposable income for clearly artificially high prices.
>> ARTICLE
As much as I like Fate/Zero, it's not worth $300 to me.
>> ARTICLE
still much cheaper than in japan, ha ha.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I guess it's time to buy the FMA BDs before Aniplex USA sits on them for eternity or re-releases them for $100 a season. 
>> ARTICLE
While normally this is where I'd try to make some funny comment about Aniplex regaining its crown of being US Anime Hitler(or at the very least an obligatory " HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN TO MEEEEEEEEEE ") in all honesty all this makes me feel is sad.
>> ARTICLE
But: Conqueror of Shamballa was form ToS, not Brotherhood.....
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully Funimation floods the market with Brotherhood before the license expires. This way the fans get it at a good price (plus if the market is flooded with it, then prices will go even lower), and it'll be a nice "fuck you" to Aniplex. I remember reading something similar on the Answerman column on ANN, where the writer, who had worked at a now defunct licensor, talked about how they flooded the market with a series before they lost the rights. 
>> ARTICLE
I might have missed some crucial info on the site, but ain't it Funimation's fault for not renewing the license?  
Do Aniplex really deserve a "fuck you" in this case?
>> ARTICLE
Funimation would never let this license lapse on purpose. Aniplex isn't going to come to the table on negotiations on their properties so Funimation never had an option to get the title back.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if expiring Funi rights means we might see these things licensed out to Crunchyroll, or Netflix. I don't know how it all works or if that's even possible, but still an interesting theory. 
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't FMA already licensed by Netflix?
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure Netflix was just sublicensing that from Funimation. But they'll probably be able to renew their license, albeit from AoA.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it is, they are missing some episodes from the end of Brotherhood though. 
>> ARTICLE
They're missing the entire final arc.
>> ARTICLE
Funimation always think you are trying to ddos their site if you do not come from a country where they are active, so I don't really know what this will mean to me...
>> ARTICLE
I remember FMA being on Netflix at some point, is it still there? I'd better get my ass watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Does this mean I could rebuy and actually be able to listen to English audio with subtitles?  (Surprisingly something you can't do on their blu-ray for whatever stupid reason)
>> ARTICLE
Probably not. The reason they made it like that in the first place is to counter reverse importation. It probably wasn't even up to Funi.
>> ARTICLE
I think they do that since their subtitle tracks are more meant for the Japanese VA, so what they're saying on the screen would contradict what the subtitles were saying.
>> ARTICLE
That's the point I want to see the original text with the current dub.   Every other anime I have ever bought allows this except this one for whatever backwards reason and as a hard of hearing person it kind of makes me angry.
>> ARTICLE
Most anime is like that though, sadly. At least it was before.
>> ARTICLE
Most anime will allow you to change the audio track and subtitle track independently during play with the remote and system menu of your dvd/ bluray player.  FMA: brotherhood Blu-ray is the only one I have ever encountered to not let you do this.
>> ARTICLE
Does this have any effect on Netflix streaming FMA:B?
>> ARTICLE
I'm beginning to think that Aniplex of America is more of a protectorate for the Japan market than an actual distributor.
>> ARTICLE
And you wouldn't be wrong. The AoA exec have given interviews wherein they've basically admitted one of the main reasons they even exist is to prevent backwards importing to Japan - and that too much backwards importing in spite of their existence could result in being shut down.
>> ARTICLE
Does this effect them being on Netflix?
>> ARTICLE
What the hell is going on with aniplex
>> ARTICLE
So would we expect CR to take some hits like this too? It's game over if they take the Monogatari series. 
>> ARTICLE
It wouldn't surprise me if Aniplex-US suffers the same fate as Geneon and Bandai Entertainment's North American branches, by withdrawing from the region entirely. But in this case, it seems like popular shows under their umbrella will remain out of print for even longer. Or if said shows do go back into print, it'll be in the form of *much* more expensive sets, similar to what happened with Gurren Lagann after Bandai-US went under. 

Aniplex's Japanese management has always seemed extra paranoid about their domestic anime customers engaging in reverse-importation, so these latest moves aren't too surprising. Most of their products on Right Stuf have a whole "this item cannot be shipped to Japan" paragraph attached to the description. I'm guessing the higher-ups over in Tokyo wanted to see that same disclaimer also get applied to FMA/DtB/Baccano, since Funimation has prices much lower than Aniplex-US.

Personally, I hope that anime licensers on Japan's side don't begin a trend of adopting the same international product practices as Aniplex in the future. The only other equivalent to Aniplex-US that I can think of is PonyCan, with their [US products](http://www.rightstufanime.com/publisher/PONYCAN) being in a similar price range. Even Bandai/Sunrise, which have their [expensive collector's editions of Gundam: The Origin](http://www.rightstufanime.com/publisher/BANDAI-VISUAL), have recently been releasing their [older Gundam shows](http://www.rightstufanime.com/publisher/SUNRISE-INC) at prices in line with typical US anime BDs/DVDs. And NIS America also seems ok with [pricing their anime](http://www.rightstufanime.com/publisher/NIS-AMERICA) closer to US levels.
>> ARTICLE
All of these Aniplex is evil comments even though they help fund these shows that Funimation is losing. 
>> ARTICLE
They "Fund" them but the amount of work Funimation put in to promote/sell/stream them in the US is a lot of work. Not to mention all the dubbing they did for them. From Making DVD's to going to Conventions Funi has done there part to help make legal anime in the west work. Now Aniplex was to use all the work they did and cut them out. I will call it now won't work they will raise the cost of all the shows on their own DVD's probably cut out the dub then wonder why no one is buying it. It is very similar to what happened to bandai USA 
>> ARTICLE
That still doesn't change the fact that Aniplex owns it...and no Aniplex will retain the rights to the dub. All Aniplex did was give the license to Funimation because they didn't have a Western branch at the time. Now that they have that they want their IP back and there's nothing wrong with that at all. This is better for the industry overall. Now Funimation will be forced to find and license other classic series that were lost when Bandai left the west (Ghost in the Shell, Code Geass, etc.). Hell Funimation just started getting in on anime production committees in Japan so they can retain the rights to Dimension W. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you're seeing people calling them evil so much as you're seeing people not looking forward to the obscenely expensive Aniplex releases coming in the future.
>> ARTICLE
I never got any discs for anime, but the question that comes to me is: Why the fuck do they cost so much? I'm not gonna hide that I pirate anime, I'm a fansubber too, but even if I wanted to support the shows I like, those prices aren't making it easy for me to do. I do buy manga though, I like print, and prices are more reasonable if you don't buy in bulks.
>> ARTICLE
Its sad that the series is not gonna be available on Funimation's streaming service but lets hope that it is available on other streaming services. Also, I always prefer streaming over buying Blu-rays and DVDs. Ok, buying Blurays for handful of favorite shows or rather getting old series at Wal-Mart or BestBuy can be cheap, but buying them all the time is not financially feasible. Just take the example of the successful Netflix streaming model.  Correct me if I am wrong but I think Funimation only lost the distribution rights, right ? So when Aniplex starts selling the English version of FMAB, the dub will still be same right ? Also, this is a great opportunity for Netflix to somehow get the proper streaming rights. Lets hope that in the near future Netflix adds a lot of dub anime to their library, because they are superior in 3 main aspects to Funimation : First being their large viewership, financial strength and most importantly a fantastic website and streaming service. As of right now, to access almost every anime title out there, you need to have atleast 4 subscriptions from Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu and another new player on the block- Daisui(OPM & UBW new additions). Lets hope we only need 2 in the future- Crunchy for all the subs and simulcasts and Netflix for the dubs.

So why don't they just buy the license back?

2003 or Brotherhood?

Bortherhood, of course.

Yeah, Brotherhood/manga Sloth is awesome. I just read his part last night (does he come back?).

He and Greed are my favorites.

I'm a big fan of Lust, though she was only good in the original. The manga nixed her off too early.

Her death was pretty epic though. Before that, I was pretty 'meh' on Brotherhood. That episode made me a fan.

one of the most satisfying deaths of an anime villain I have ever seen

Pretty much. I stopped reading the manga at the point where he was supposed to be introduced. So I don't really remember the REAL Sloth.

I just read the volume after that, and, seriously, pick it back up. Sloth is fucking awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking GREED!!!!

Methinks you're missing one... The original and most important one of them all. Or are all of them technically him?

They are parts of him, but they are not him. I think...

He is the original homunculus, the dwarf in the glass...
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but the others come from him, yet are not him.
>> ARTICLE
SPOILER!!!!!!

he removed to parts to make himself the ultimate being
>> ARTICLE
Mm yes. But considering he isn't human, does the removal of human sins mean anything? Or does the fact that he DID have human sins make him human?
>> ARTICLE
I believe he said he got rid of them... He said something about that to Hohenheim...
>> ARTICLE
Yes, he did get rid of them. Hohenheim trolled him a bit about shedding the homunculus Pride first. Or maybe he was just thinking out loud in front of Pride about it inside the tunnels. Fuzzy memory for me too I guess

Well now I guess I'll have to re-watch the 5th season. POOR ME :(
>> ARTICLE
Well enjoy!
>> ARTICLE
IS FMA: Brotherhood a retelling of the story, or is it a different story altogether?  Seems like a retelling.  I hated the ending of the series, so I'm curious if they changed it to make more sense.
>> ARTICLE
The first anime followed the manga up until it caught up with it (which was around Hughes' death) and then went off and did its own thing. Brotherhood followed the manga story the whole way through (and actually ended about a month after the manga.) 

If you didn't like the ending of the first anime, you'll almost certainly like Brotherhood more.
>> ARTICLE
If your main problem with the original was its cobbled together story, then you'll probably really like Brotherhood. The events in the plot flow together really well and the show ends with minor plot holes if any. Also the characters are all really well made (I would say more depth than the original, despite the show's lighter tone), and the world is well crafted. Both of those help make for a more sensible story.

TL;DR: Good fuckin' show. Watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood follows the manga instead of going into a different direction altogether. The story is much more enjoyable and the ending is satisfying. The first 10 or 20 episodes overlap for both series though
>> ARTICLE
Cool. I might actually have to check it out. Is it done? What about subbing, are the fansubs done or official releases?
>> ARTICLE
I personally watch the fansubs from [CoalGirls](http://coalgirls.wakku.to/?p=3241). They take their video from the blu-rays so it's excellent quality.
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood is generally considered to be better than the original and whenever someone talks about it they usually refer to brotherhood. It's an amazing series. Just like the guy below me said, the subs and dubs are availabe by Funimation. You can also watch them officially on Youtube or Netflix

>> ARTICLE
Funimation has both sub and dub: [http://www.funimation.com/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood](http://www.funimation.com/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood)
>> ARTICLE
it's directly from the manga. The first anime diverges from the manga after [Al gets kidnapped by Greed.](/spoiler)

Brotherhood stays true to the manga throughout its entire run
>> ARTICLE
Wrath is a badass among badasses.  He was easily the most entertaining homunculus.  

I loved Brotherhood so much.  The original anime had some better tearjerker moments and MGS-esque WTF plot twists but the manga/Brotherhood had much better characters and plot overall.

My only complaint was the pacing at the beginning and white Rose. Went too fast at the beginning (I understand why, but they killed some great moments like Hughes...)

Awe... I tried watching that show but could not get past the second episode.

It gets a lot better if you are willing to give it another shot. The first two episodes were slow, didn't advance the plot much, and were very scattered, but it does become a magnificent anime as you progress a bit further. 
>> ARTICLE
It starts off slow but it picks up later. Its worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Seems thats the way it's been of late with a lot of shows in general. One had to invest time to sit through the crappy beginning before it takes off.

Pride looks a bit like a South Park character in that picture.

I don't like Brotherhood's version of Sloth tbh.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Wouldn't it have to be made by fans to be fan fiction?

There are good stories that are anime-originals, it's just rarer. Usually the manga ends up being superior, but I don't think that happened with FMA.

I think Brotherhood and the first animated release are both equally good. They were just radically different. Brotherhood is light-hearted and more like a typical shonen. The anime-original plot was really dark.

Normally I prefer purely-manga-based stories, but this time the animation team did a fine job finishing the story. 

There was a reason FMA was on many people's top 10 lists for years before Brotherhood existed.
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood's Sloth is better in that he actually represents the sin he's named after by being a lazy fuck, as opposed to the first anime's Sloth whose powers/personality had nothing to do with sloth at all. 

In terms of how good/interesting they are objectively as characters, yes, the personification of Ed and Al's original sin probably beats out a big strong lazy guy.

While I loved the manga/Brotherhood's versions of Greed and Bradley (Pride in the first anime, wrath in the manga), I think the Homunculi were, as a group, better developed in the first anime series.
>> ARTICLE
Love this series by far! Such an awesome picture. Thanks for putting this up. Also, any downvotes for this are from shitty people.

What's the spoiler? The ending sucks. Awaits down votes.
>> ARTICLE
The ending sucks? I thought it was good. 
>> ARTICLE
I still don't know how Edward beat the final boss besides looking like he just screamed louder than usual. The last battle in the city sucks for those reasons... Everything else was good though.
>> ARTICLE
As other people said, Wrath and Pride's identities are best left as surprises. Also, Envy's true form is hinted at and Gluttony's Eye of Truth. Those two aren't tremendous spoilers, but it's best to give a warning just in case.

I guess the ending may not be for everyone. I loved it: the warrior comes full circle and lets go of his weapon. Classic, classy ending.
>> ARTICLE
I will probably like the other FMA's ending instead...if I  get bored enough to watch it someday.

>Those two aren't tremendous spoilers, but it's best to give a warning just in case.

Classy move though, well done sir.

Wrath or "Fhrer King Bradley", isn't known to be a homonculus until later in the series.

The world isn't at risk of ending or anything like in other worlds. You're not trapped in some different universe or video game with silly rules. There's law and order but just barely, it's basically the wild west in space.

The thought of having a cyberbrain is amazing. Surf the web, look up stuff, store stuff on your external (cyberbrain) memory and access it like we do Google or Wikipedia nowadays but in real time. Your eyes basically double as GoPros or dash cams. You can talk to people in your head and etc.     

There's also cybernetic prosthetics making humans better than they were born with but all of this raises existential questions about what *is* a human being. And the world isn't a utopia with WWIII, cyberbrain hackings and etc.

Also Nen can be so much more complex than chakra and ki. There aren't even bullshit power ups!
>> ARTICLE
> their world is just ours turned upside down

How so?

>There aren't even bullshit power ups!

Many would disagree when it comes to [HxH](/s "Gon versus Pitou.")
>> ARTICLE
[HxH](/s "Not bullshit at all. Gon was gone mentally, and didn't give a fuck about anything anymore, he just wanted to murder Pitou. As such, using the Vow and Restriction clause of Nen, as seen with Kurapika in the Phantom Troupe arc, he got a massive powerup in exchange for the rest of his lifeforce or potential. The only part you could call BS would be Alluka fixing him later, but even then she has yet to be explained so that could end up not being BS as well.")
>> ARTICLE
I replied elsewhere so instead of copy pasting I'll [link it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3dus8m/what_anime_has_the_best_world/ct8xgwb)
>> ARTICLE
[HxH](/s "A nen powerup of that magnitude wouldn't work for just anyone. If somebody like Tonpa were to try it, he'd only get a marginal boost. It's because Gon was so talented with all his potential. Instead of training for 50 years like Netero did, he just took all that power at once, right then, in exchange for losing the rest of his life.")
>> ARTICLE
If that were to be the case then it'd be somewhat poor writing for me. 'Muh potential' isn't a very original or intricate way of getting MCs to succeed. Or in other words, channeling his future '50 years of training' in an instant doesn't seem like a balanced application of the condition system, regardless of trade off. Time has value, perhaps the largest of all, and that essentially voids it.
>> ARTICLE
[HxH](/s "No No it was just 'Muh potential' it was his *life* that he was sacrificing. He should have died from doing something like that.")
>> ARTICLE
[HxH](/s "It wasn't just trading his 'potential', though it was that as well. Gon committed himself to a fate described by the other characters as "worse than death", as well as giving up his nen / future / etc.. His conviction wasn't just giving up his Nen, or his life, as that wouldn't be enough to gain the preposterous amounts of strength he displayed. Gon gave up on life, betrayed the trust of his friends, and committed himself to live the rest of his life in that horrible state that you see later in the hospital in order to gain that strength and atone for his perceived guilt over Kite's death.")

[HxH](/s "As others have mentioned, the only BS comes in with Alluka healing Gon later, but as Gon can't use Nen any more, and the fact that the manga was building towards explaining more about the unknown continent, it's likely that Killua's wish isn't going to end up being the BS that it seems. However, that's just speculation currently, but maybe we'll know eventually?")
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
[HxH](/s "Well that's just the way things work, as was said by Pitou itself while it was getting beaten to hell and back by adult Gon. The only downside from Alluka's wish now is that Gon can't seem to use Nen anymore.")
>> ARTICLE
You think gon will get his nen back?
>> ARTICLE
In time, yeah. It's almost certain because otherwise he'll have to stop being the main character because he won't be able to go anywhere any more.

Either Ging and the rest go to the DC and something happens there that gets his nen back, or he has to reopen his Nen pores again and train from scratch before accompanying them all to DC, if i had to guess what Togashi has in store for us next.
>> ARTICLE
yea i hope so
>> ARTICLE
[spoilers](/s "I wouldn't call Alluka's powers b.s. since there are such strong restrictions on his abilities")

>> ARTICLE
[](/s "I don't think it was bs because didn't he place a vow and limitation on himself or whatever it was called like kurapika did?")
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it didn't come out of nowhere, but that doesn't mean it made sense. [HxH](/s "Regardless of his potential, Gon was outclassed by Pitou by orders of magnitude. For him to be able to not just overcome that but also completely obliterate Pitou in such an instant and one sided way left a bitter impression that anyone could accomplish anything by simply trading their lives. Which, somewhat comically, Gon didn't even end up doing.")

A simple example of a show where the 'trade-off' mechanic was pulled off in what I felt was a better way came recently in [Shokugeki -](/s "Souma couldn't just come into Totsuki and challenge people for their Elite Ten seats by simply wagering his expulsion; his place in the academy had to have recognisable value in the first place. The analogy here is that Gon was far too weak next to Pitou in order for it to make sense to me that Nen's conditional system would grant him that much power. It establishes a poor precedent for me.")
>> ARTICLE
I like you. The mechanic it created opens the door for literally any character to do the same under dire circumstances. Whenever a hero (or even a villain) is facing certain death in battle and doesn't do the same, we're going to be left wondering why not.

I think some people may not get the significance/meaning of "orders of magnitude", but that's entirely accurate considering how far outclassed Kite was, and how far Kite outclassed Gon.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! Looking at the balance on my comment it's refreshing to see some agreement :P
>> ARTICLE
[HxH](/s "Gon was an enhancer, he poured every fiber of his being into his ability in exchange for his life. He was obviously going to outclass her in hand to hand combat. Take Uvogin for example, he was going up against professional Nen users and was completely overwhelemed by their plan. However he was challenged in a contest of strength and overwhelmed them. It's really the only thing they're good at so I think it's kind of fair. Also for the sake of argument, he would have died if not for Alluka")

[HxH Manga Spoilers](/s "to add insult to injury, He possibly can't use Nen anymore.")
>> ARTICLE
It's not that obvious to me, but you made some good points. Also thanks a bunch for separating Manga and Anime spoiler tags.

No problem. I definitely recommend the manga though, and honestly I don't think you're wrong, I just believe that there is a fair enough bit of material on the whole matter to deem it acceptable enough to defend.

I've come to expect from the conditional shit in HxH to just be a tool for main characters to beat the villains.

That's exactly what happened, yes.

>> ARTICLE
Instead of having a lot of filler arcs One Piece stretches out scenes by adding in fluff and long recaps in the beginning.

Entire premise of the series recap, current arc recap, OP. By then we're like 6 minutes in. And then they animate things that Oda's editor forced him to leave out of the manga because they were unnecessary. Which sounds like it's a more complete experience than the manga, but you'll soon realise that Oda's editor is to be trusted and cuts things that really should be cut.

I actually like getting into long anime because it gives you the option to choose your own viewing pace.

>> ARTICLE
Know it's weird replying to a 2 month old comment but this just resonates with me cause I hate when people say some anime like One Piece is "too long" finding a good long anime is like finding gold mine. Like you said you can watch it at your own pace. An episode or two a day, binge it, watch several episodes ever few days and so on. It sucks ass being bored looking around the internet trying to find a new tv show, anime, movie or whatever to watch so when you find something as good and long as One Piece you just be happy.

I'd rather not be enlisted into the Kou army. I'm not a mage, so I'd be shit on by Magomett and friends. And any other country has been going through serious shit or could be attacked any day now.

That said, it is a really cool world. Maybe I could capture a dungeon and become a metal-vessel user!

You forgot about Reim(?) Which was pretty fine as a country, nothing really of note there and the (Holy shit my memory is bad "Red Haired Slaves) were treated as people there.

Reim is Scheherazade's country right? They're still on Kou's list of places to invade. They do treat the Fanalis pretty good there though, which is awesome.

Yeah but "everywhere" is on Kou's list of places to invade (Sindria is just last on the list) Also yes, that's Scheherazade's country. It's pretty "normal" compared to everywhere else.

I agree wholeheartedly. The magi world was so vibrant and wild. It really felt like adventure was just waiting around every corner. The world seemed huge and full of life, whereas as a lot of other fantasy anime worlds fall under a sort of "video game" trap where you almost feel like you're following a breadcrumb of zones that only exist/matter whenever mc's are there.

It's wonderful, ain't it? I just mean that it's an intriguing universe, with all the different people and the aliens going about devouring the earth. Sure, it might seem plain, but at the same time it's just the same as our earth except it has mechanical magical girls and aliens.

EDIT: Oh, and some girls wear skirts. [Hanna-Justina Marseille](http://i.imgur.com/f2GBCBu.jpg), for example, has a short one. [Adolfine Galland](http://i.imgur.com/tbbchE5.jpg)(the Karlsland Air Commodore, former Witch) even has regular pants.

My 2 favorite settings in anime are Durarara's and Shinsekai Yori's.

Durarara's world comes together through a colorful cast and how they interact.  The city just feels alive in DRRR.

SSY's world is built upon mystery and slowly unveiling the secrets about the world.  The world building in SSY is top notch.
>> ARTICLE
exactly my thoughts, my favorite settings, being SSY the best one, because it had so much psychological stuff built around it, that made me really feel inside the anime and had it flowing very easily.
>> ARTICLE
So Ra No Wo To and Shinsekai Yori for me.
>> ARTICLE
Now that I think about it, those shows really did have a similar feel when it came to worldbulding, didn't they? I never noticed that before

>> ARTICLE
It's not really that I would want to live in it, I just found it very interesting.
>> ARTICLE
A bit unfair to compare since the franchise has had 35 years to develop it, but the Universal Century from Gundam is definitely my favorite anime setting. The relatively realistic (as realistic as you can get in a setting with newtype space magic, anyway) explanations for the world and the grittiness of it all was probably what attracted me to Gundam to begin with. 

Right now I'm reading The Plot to Assassinate Gihren Zabi and it just solidifies my opinion that this is probably one of the most interesting and well thought-out worlds out there when it's handled correctly. When it's handled incorrectly... Well... 
>> ARTICLE
Given how few people actually watch gundam, let alone a significant portion of UC, I think its completely fair to bring it up. Its hard to compete with 35 years of worldbuilding and politics and all the other social issues you see in gundam.
>> ARTICLE
I really like Chaika's setting. It's a great mix of medieval fantasy and kinda futuristic-ish steam-punk. It's just fun seeing archers, swordsmen, knights and frigging snipers in the same universe. I also like how unusual magic is in their world and how many unique applications it has.

Twelve Kingdoms / Juuni Kouki
>> ARTICLE
Twelve Kingdoms really impressed me. Not just because its world is interesting and grows more interesting as the story progresses, but because it approaches world-building in such a way that it doesn't often step on the toes of the story being told. There are few stories in any medium that I will praise for their world-building because I've been cynical about it for a long, long time. Twelve Kingdoms is one of them. 
>> ARTICLE
Sidonia no Kishi ? there is a lot more but thats the first that come to mind , im a big fan of those humanity survival situation like battlestar galaticta and stuff when everything is on the line and sacrifice are to be done at all time it just thrill me hardcore for some reasons :o
>> ARTICLE
after scrolling down so far, i started to think this thread was "which anime has the best world for living in" or something along those lines, and this really caught me off guard for a second
>> ARTICLE
Monster Musume. Because of many *reasons*.
>> ARTICLE
The setting seems to be pretty normal. It's some of the people inhabiting it that makes the setting interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say that a world where humans and monsters co-exist is an abnormal setting. 

Also, since the whole plot is based around an exchange program, clearly the monsters are coming from *somewhere*, but the show hasn't gone into it yet.

Abnormal or not. I want a harem full of them.

Life will be different, but it'll be **worth it**.

Whoa, have you seen the shit MC guy who's name I can't possibly remember has been through?

Not to say it wouldn't be a wonderful world to live in.

I don't think the MCs name has been said in the anime, apparently it's only come up 2-3 times in the manga.

Mrs. Smith calls him by name in the first episode actually. Just so happens that it never gets mentioned after that in the anime so far.

This is a bit premature, but the world for the currently airing *Gate* been amazing so far.

only 3 episodes so far so it hasnt actually done a lot of worldbuilding but the worldbuilding we have seen is what /u/razzy1818 finds amazing

Oh, people know. If you look at the discussion threads at all, *they know*.

this is an anime subreddit after all, you cant expect everyone to have read the source material.

Point taken. I have an habit of checking to see if something is an adaptation and check out the original work most of the time


>> ARTICLE
Actually, it was originally a light novel, then adapted into a manga, then an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Earlier than that, it began life as an Internet publication (like stories you'd see on fictionpress.com or back when folks used to write on personal websites like Geocities or Angelfire) then it was published as a novel series, then re-edited and republished as a series of light novels, then adapted into a manga, and now an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Shit gotta find that asap. Thxs for info
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't have said it better myself.
>> ARTICLE
There's elf girls, tanks, guns, and fire breathing dragons.

Pretty cool if you ask me.
>> ARTICLE
What I really like about it as well is the series could've just been about a more advanced society invading us, like Aldnoah Zero where we all get slaughtered, but it's the exact opposite. The invaders incredibly inferior to modern technology and they had no idea, meaning they went in completely blind with no intel. 

I know that at some point problems for the defence force will arise, and it will be interesting to see how they do, because army vs army the special world gets destroyed 1000 times out of 1000. 

No Manga spoilerino plserino. 
>> ARTICLE
"A more advanced society invading us" is literally the plot of every alien invasion movie ever, and it's really starting to get on the same level of overdone as zombies
>> ARTICLE
> I know that at some point problems for the defence force will arise

Just speculation, I'm thinking that they might get into political, humanitarian and/or magical problems.

Fire dragon is a problem already [GATE ep3 spoiler](/s "and they only wounded him, which makes every animal even more dangerous.") I'm also guessing dragons are rather intelligent.
>> ARTICLE
Manga had good world building but they might fuck it up in the anime because...



They censor it too much


Or


They skip some things entirely. These include politics,relations,general info etc

If these things dont happen then I think the world is fine. Well they cencored Rory already so I dont have my hopes up

Likewise with Overlord, it has potential to do it better than any of the other similar premise series.

Agreed.  When the MC went up into the sky and looked out at the world, I was very impressed with what they were working with.  I believe it will develop into when one of the best set video game worlds to date.
>> ARTICLE
Yes this is the kind of thing I've been waiting for. I really love the Modern armies vs medieval armies theme.
>> ARTICLE
I like the premise (Modern military vs fantasy), but the world built so far has been *rather* generic (which is part of the point no?). Most interesting world building so far was the actions of the King(?) of the empire.

>> ARTICLE
The manga is able to deal with a lot of stuff they can't put into the anime so i suggest reading it.

Always thought Shinseki Yori had one of the most well thought out worlds .

Log Horizon had one of the best accurate portrayals of an MMO experience so that was an enjoyable watch.

Shinsekai yori had an amazing world, but was so depressing.
>> ARTICLE
[Shinsekai](/s "I think one thing that made it so depressing was the fact that it was so real. Like you could see exactly how a world would end up like that. Every step made sense at the time but when they all added up the entire world was wrong.")

**Gintama**

Its like rurouni kenshin world mix with Akira Neo tokyo .

where samurai's and Geisha's live with Aliens and normal humans . You got houses and buildings that looks like from Japan 1603 yet many people owns a car and motor cycle .
>> ARTICLE
They can literally do whatever they want with Gintama's stories, and that's the key to any long running series. Variety. For example:

* Classic swordfights? Accounted for.

* Alien attacks? Check.

* Sailing the sea? Sure.

* Space travel? Yep.

* Various genre parodies? In spades.

* Character pieces? Certainly.

* Gambling? You bet!

* Pet problems? Enough to shake a stick at.

* The list goes on, and on...
>> ARTICLE
Yep agreed on everything their arcs are so diverse . 


>> ARTICLE
I've been watching A Certain Magical Index/Scientific Railgun(according to the watch order), and the world is really interesting to me. It's easily one of the highlights of this series.

Index really rushes through its arcs, but Railgun has done an excellent job at presenting this world.
>> ARTICLE
This largely comes down to my being a sucker for steampunk but I ADORE the world of Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water. A pastiche of Jules Verne's best work directed by hideaki anno with such fanatical devotion to detail that it inadvertently created Evangelion when he had a nervous breakdown, originally conceptualized by Hayao Miyazaki? Sign me the fuck up!

I  also really like how the world is a character in Irresponsible Captain Tylor. the way the serious space opera setting clashes with tylor's screwball comedy antics is really engaging to watch.

and I'd be remiss to omit Spice and Wolf. I don't think I've ever seen another show go that deep into the economics of its world. Maoyuu tried and failed, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
I've always thought Evangelion had a really neat world once you found all the supplemental materials to put it all together.   Clearly the pre-history of the Evangelion world was radically different than what we know of the real world, and the implications of it all have a *lot* of great story potential beyond what the series/movies cover.

Actually explaining what I mean would just turn this into a giant black spoiler block, though.   Just read through the entire [EvaWiki](http://wiki.evageeks.org/) for the craziness.

>> ARTICLE
As an oldschool Pokemon fan, let me tell you why you're wrong.

First, with every new season it's like they discovered a new part of the land, because you never hear something of it before they are there (or when they leave the area), i know this is because it's build on games wich are not even produced when the preview season airs, but still. Second, we don't know what power-structure they have, do they have a king, a president, or anything in this way. Third, why is nobody doing anything against those *huge* underworld gangs? every area has at leats one of them (there was one that wanted to flood the whole world, for Arceus's sake!!!). Fourth, why are they all suprised when they see super common Pokemon in a new area? it's like there is no communication between, let's say, Kanto and Hoenn  besides the two leading Professors.

I love Pokemon to death (more the games than the anime), but it's world building is horrible.
>> ARTICLE
according to words from the producer, guide books and what not,

many men decide to become pokemon masters at a young age, and realize very late that their dreams are very hard to attain, and many who give up these dreams start at the bottom of the social ladder. 

This is why much of the workforce parts of the society are dominated by women.


>> ARTICLE
Yeah but if you could live in any universe, Pokemon would at least be in the top 5 and would be many people's number 1

thats because with pokemon we have a chance of becoming strong. Any other anime world i would be generic character that shows up for one episode

Yup, you'd get owned by the random bad asses that would inevitably show up and start some shit.

That is probably for at least 90% of us because of Pokmon..

I think *Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei* has the most developed world of any anime, though that's mostly thanks to the light novel by Tsutomu-*san*. It explains the magic and various other aspects of the world, such as transport and schools in great detail.
>> ARTICLE
He really did seem to consider many of the mundane aspects of world functions that other authors don't. For a major contrast, you can't watch Fullmetal Alchemist/Brotherhood without wondering why there are normal carpenters and such when people could be using alchemy to erect elaborate buildings in moments.
>> ARTICLE
I totally agree. It's sad that that the anime didn't really bother to explain it.
>> ARTICLE
That's the main reason why I think a lot of anime only watchers didn't like the show as much as people who actually read the LN. You can't really fit all that exposition and explanation into an anime episode otherwise it'd be 20 minutes of talking. 

That being said, it's also why I like the Mahouka universe so much. It actually explains all the stuff unlike other series with magic where the explanation literally is "cuz magic". 
>> ARTICLE
even with so much detail about even the mundane everyday kind of things it's very very interesting! you really do get sucked in to their "futuristic Japan" and care for the characters (which there are a huuuugee amount)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it has to be said that *Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei* does world-building better than any other series. 

Go Onii-sama! /r/OneTrueTatsuya & /r/Mahouka

Dog Days. Interesting world with a lot of background that hasn't fully been explored, areas with high magical energy keep people from dying, interesting animals, gods interact with humans and some of them can be more or less considered human, interesting magical technology that functions as television, microphones, speakers, [S3 Spoilers](/s "a sky sea that was newly introduced with what seems to be the main god, the sky whale, the sky people living in it, and the sky priestess who seems to watch over the world.") There are demons that haven't been explored as to why they are there or why they are linked to swords yet, fun and interesting magic powers, and their wars are so interesting and fun you just can't help want to live there too.
>> ARTICLE
Beat me to it. I'm in it mostly for the kemonomimi, but I also love how colourful and pretty everything is (and of course the lore aspect is also a great ;).

The "wars" between the countries are also brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece, no contest. Things happen off-screen (or off-chapter?) that you get updates about and the world is constantly changing. Things introduced in the beginning are extremely relevant hundreds of chapters and episodes later. Shit, there's a guy on the moon amassing an army, a mostly unseen revolutionary force is making serious waves against the government, and an entire half of the main cast of characters has been absent for over a year doing their own shit. The lore is amazing too. The secret history that is covered up, devil fruits, rare swords, etc.

I was pretty surprised there was nothing here too. I've seen the first half of Fate/Zero and so far there's a lot of worldbuilding. And I know that I'm not even scratching the surface with this universe. There's like a crap load more source material to sift through. 
>> ARTICLE
The BETAverse. It's a parallel universe to KimiNozo and MuvLuv.

It's a world-wide war against an alien invasion, with several fronts and many point of views to explore. The whole thing is way more grounded in reality than Gundam. World history is rewritten all the way back to the end of WWII.

We got only one anime (Total Eclipse) covering Japan's retreat in the 1998, and then it time skips to 2001 and sets itself in Alaska.

There's a new anime upcoming (Schwarzesmarken) covering the early 80s in East Germany.

But there's so much more to write about. They have more than 55years of human history to explore and two timelines starting from 2001.

Call me a psychopath, but I loved Danganronpa and Code Geass' worlds.

Danganronpa's world just went with the mystery and suspense story, especially the big reveal of what's on the outside. Loved Danganronpa in general.

Code Geass had such a unique setting, and the world after the story seemed like it would be a much better and happier place to live. Then again, maybe my fanboy is taking over since Code Geass is my favorite anime.

I was a fan of Medaka Box's world.  

In essence it's a world where people can be born as Normals (normal people), Specials (people who are like prodigies in a given field.  Like normal people, except EXTREMELY gifted in one area), and Abnormals (people whose personalities give them a special ability which often breaks the laws of physics.)

Eventually the series comes to focus on Abnormals, but the fact that Abnormals' abilities are reflections of their personality is a novel idea.  For example, a chronic liar had the ability to make reality into nothing.  An abnormal who thrived by mimicking others to fit in had the power to copy other people's powers by seeing them.  An abnormal with a god complex had the power to give commands to people that they had to obey.  

I always thought having a person's powers being tied in with their personalities so closely was a neat idea.

Even though they really didn't do much with it, Akame ga Kill had an amazing world filled with interesting powers people's and creatures.

In my opinion, stand alone complex has the best world because of how densely the technological concepts are explored every episode but also because of how the narrative is so we'll integrated and complimentary of that world. Every episode we get new ideas and world building to the point where it's easily the most fleshed out sci Fi world in anime in terms of how everything works. The concept of a stand alone complex also functions perfectly in the series and is integrated into both seasons' world masterfully.

Log horizon is a cost second, though.

It feels like it has a huge amount of potential, but i guess that if you take away the video game aspects, it just becomes another fantasy world
>> ARTICLE
I like Log Horizon and One Piece. Both worlds feel pretty vast and stuff is happening elsewhere in the world too.
>> ARTICLE
Well I would love to be able to build Gunpla and used it to fight with other Gunpla's so Gundam Build Fighters is my pick.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen Log Horizon but the world of FMA is a nightmarish catholic inspired hell hole. When you say best world i'm assuming you mean world you would want to live in. The only thing I could imagine being a worse place to live is its spiritual successor AoT.
>> ARTICLE
I still think Casshern Sins had a pretty cool thing going with its post apocalyptic 70s robots look going. I love how the character designs contrast so well with the dead backgrounds and yet it somehow works. 

As for the worldbuilding, I like how they kept things more or less unexplained. Some things were told straight up, others are shown and other things are just left open for the viewer to fill in the blanks.

Kino no tabi, kamisama no inai nichiyoubi, Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita,  Juuni Kokki, many :D . I don't agree with op and others, shinsekai no yori for example is a really unique world and interesting, but log horizonis only another online world, Index i don't think that the world is too interesting in the anime at least, for me it seems the current world with magues, and we have a lot of those. I think that you need some background or at least a deep explanation of how that world works. It seems a popularity ranking with one piece, index, log horizon more than a thread about interesting worlds.

Unless that im misunderstanding everything and you are talking about a world to live.

So I don't know why this is being skipped over, but DBZ would be amazing. Think about it, it's an incredibly technologically developed world, but more importantly because of the existence of other people already with special abilities there's a damn good chance you could also achieve them by training as well. The after life is an actual thing and just being a good person gets you there, and if you're a hero you still get to keep your body. The way I look at that world is that your potential is practically limitless depending on how much effort you want to put into yourself.
>> ARTICLE
The setting of the anime "Problem Children Are Coming From Another World" which is known as The Little Garden is the best. Its basically its own dimension connected to every possible timeline and version of earth where every mythological or super powered being be it monster, god, demon, angel, hero, or villain  is invited to go, where they join communities that make bets with each other over items, treasure, money, weapons, resources, their own powers, or anything else in order to help their own community.

I'd say that, despite not enjoying the show very much, I think Spice and Wolf was a show with very strong world building. All of the characters for the most part felt very believable in how they acted towards each other and the things around them. Plus the show really does delve into the economic side of things pretty heavily so that helps out too.

So Ra No Wo To's, mysterious, calm, rather small but lively post-apocalyptic world really caught my interest. The world and the atmosphere really caught on and made me appreciate it as one of the best shows I've ever lived to see.

*Fairy Tail*

Think about it. Magic of all sorts + heroes and villains + mythical elements to it. I might just be a huge fan of rpgs and mythical worlds but when you think about it there's a hella lot of things going on in these long running anime series that just makes their world so expandable. FT is just my opinion but I guess my reasoning could also be used for others like Naruto, One Piece, or even Pokmon.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop, Durarara, The Magi, and Fairy Tail. 

Fairy Tail would probably be the one I would want to live in because I think it would be awesome to be a wizard, belong to a guild, and go on adventurous missions all the time for a living.

.hack//roots if i remember correctly does a better job to balance the action or boringness that SIGN was, I would recommend the OVA of .hack//Quantum, but which seems its nowhere to be legally streamed in the U.S.

To truly come to know the world of .hack, there is no going around reading Light Novels or Manga. Or even playing the original games.

Imagine being 12, and being elite enough to beat up the elite 4 and challenge crime syndicates on the strength of you as a trainer, and your pokemon.

FMAB is a great anime part of my top 5, though I the world is not even the best, it only makes. interesting if you can perform Alchemy

Fate asweth the Magic Society is hidden from the world so its not convenient if you're not part of any Magic Family or trained whatsoever, that'd would put you in an average life a commoner (same goes for Mahouka)

Either SAO or LOG HORIeven has it even if the interesting part is in the virtual world the tech to live for is in that timeline IMO. (Unless you wanna be part of mech wars wherein you get nuked in a second)

I won't deny that the crisper art and animation played some role.  However, I really like the (human) character they introduced in episode 6, and not to hype it up, but the follow-up to that episode is excellent.  Actually, in looking at the episode summaries (as it's easy to forget which were in which season after the fact), the second half episodes are all really great, in my book, and that season has one of the more serious conclusion arcs out of the four.

Why Kuroko?
>> ARTICLE
I have an extremely personal connection to Kuroko no Basket.

I used to play basketball in middle school a lot, but I fell out of it because of the competitive curve when highschool hit. It also helped motivate me to work out when I had no reason at all to want to, basically no reason to want to live either. It pushed me to my limit with how hyped the games made me. I'd always be listening to the Kuroko OPs and be hyped whenever a new team was going to be playing. I appreciated the personal growth of not only Seirin, but every single rival team in the series. 

And while some people may call Kuroko no Basket a "generic shounen series, except turned into basketball", to me it's so much more, it's a complete enthralling experience that gets you out of your seat and screaming as well as crying whenever something happens to the endearing cast of characters, even when they're the antagonist. The sense of rivalry and the amount of energy this anime gave me, I have not been able to replicate it since.
>> ARTICLE
> a "generic shounen series, except turned into basketball"  

Well, that'd be true if it was a niche series that only appealed to people like you, who have a personal connection to it. What impresses me about this series is that it made me (and many other people) fall in love with it, despite having little interest in basketball in the first place.  

So yeah, on top of the usual shonen thing mixed with an original theme, there's the incredible animation, a decent story with actual character development (for entire teams and rivals, not just the 2 main guys), amazing soundtrack, good pacing throughout all 3 seasons... I don't know if that qualifies as "generic", but it's sure worth a 10/10 for me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really not a fan of the show, but I can definitely get where you're coming from.

* Nagi no Asukara

* Rokka no Yuusha 

* One Punch Man

Edit: Things
>> ARTICLE
Rokka no Yuusha, why? Just curious, I didn't think it was that great. 
>> ARTICLE
When I rate, I don't rate off favorites I rate off what I think it deserves. First off, I saw very few general flaws with that show. Nothing stood out to me as horrible or even bad (besides the cg). The animation was great, the character designs were fantastic and really stood out to me, and the characters all had really interesting personalities and none were as bland as some from other shows. I also thought the mystery side of things isn't done very often at all so this was pretty unique. The setting was great and backstory actually implemented well with the MC's "I'm the strongest man." He actually trained for it. No BS power of "love and friendship." Everything we were taught about that universe made sense. Personally, it is one of my favorite shows. Unfortunately, Rokka no Sales most likely will not get another season. 

Edit: Grammar
>> ARTICLE
Not OP, but I have the show pretty highly rated myself (gave it a 9), so I can see why he would give it a 10. It had very enjoyable characters, an interesting mystery plot (that I got spoiled but was still fun to watch nonetheless), and intense fight scenes. I was always on the edge of my seat waiting to see how characters would react and what would happen next. Definitely 10 material in my opinion.

EDIT: Actually, after reviewing my thoughts on the show, I went back and gave it a 10. It's just too good :O

It's honestly one of the reasons I put off making a MAL for so long.

What exactly is your ranking system?

Everything starts as a 10 and points are subtracted as problems arise.

>> ARTICLE
Basically, yeah.
>> ARTICLE
But FMA: Brotherhood had enough to warrant a 2 point drop?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I just didn't really feel that much of a connection to the characters as others did. There were just too many spread too thin, and the the Homunculi, Lust especially, I feel were underutilized.
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, I'm not even a big Gundam fan, but *War in the Pocket* is fantastic. Don't see that one a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Whether or not you like Gundam or mecha, War in the Pocket is an amazing watch that more people need to check out. It tackles similar ideas as Grave of the Fireflies, but IMO it does the anti-war message and showcasing how tragic war really is better (to Grave of the Fireflies credit, it was never truly about showcasing that, though that is what most people associated it with)
>> ARTICLE
I think War in the Pocket doesn't get enough credit for it's [visuals](https://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/17593/animated-effects-explosions-gundam-mecha-mitsuo_is) too. The opening sequence with the zeon special forces is one of my favourites in anime.

Not really in any particular order, other than Toradora which is easily my favorite:

* Toradora
* Code Geass S2
* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
* Spice and Wolf 2
* Anohana
* Fate/Zero S2
* SAO
* Also, I'd like to put Kara no Kyoukai here as a series in general, but MAL doesn't let me do that.

(My ratings for Code Geass, FMA, F/Z and S&W mostly apply to the series in general and not just the season itself)

Molester Man

 The World God Only Knows

Need to read more manga...

Edit: forgot one




>> ARTICLE
If you liked Molester Man, you need to read Onani Master Kurosawa. I ranked both 10/10. Same artist too.
>> ARTICLE
Oh hell yes. I love Molester Man's art. It had such a nice charm to it. Definitely planning on reading Onani soon! I gotta let the Molester feels die down...
>> ARTICLE
I completely understand man, I just read them both about a month ago (the perfect time to read MM, unknown to me prior to starting)

OMK is different, but still very good. I also highly suggest reading the epilogue chapters from the light novel that are translated online, they provide a much better end to the series than the regular end. (Plus it's more, so why not)
>> ARTICLE
Will do. Thanks for the suggestion and heads-up!
>> ARTICLE
Dude, you need to read Onani Master Kurosawa.
>> ARTICLE
Planning to read that soon! Don't know much about Onani, but apparently it's great and is always mentioned whenever Molester pops up.

Hunter x Hunter 2011 and Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

HxH 1999 (I gave 2011 a 9) plus its OVAs got 10s from me, and also Code Geass. I have a few 9s (about six) but rhose two are the only 10 series.

Its not an anime, but Super Danganronpa 2 probably wouldve gotten a 10 from me as well.
>> ARTICLE
Off the top of my head I know I've given 10s to: Death Parade, FMA:B, Hourou Musuko, Your Lie In April, Psycho-Pass, Antique Bakery, No.6, and a few others of course. I know I give a lot of 8s and 9s tho.

In alphabetical order

* Cowboy Bebop  An obvious classic, Watanabe is a genius director.  
* Detroit Metal City  Few other comedy anime have made me laugh quite this hard, and it was just such a focused package.  
* Gankutsuou  Count of Monte Cristo IN SPACE with crazy artstyle, it doesn't get more anime than this.  
* Haikyuu  I was never really into sports anime, nor do I care for volleyball, but this anime is just so disgustingly. Well done in every aspect I can't help but love it. Great characters, great animation, great voice acting, great storytelling, I'd have to nitpick to find flaws.  
* Hunter x Hunter  The author has amazing guts in how he deviates from the norms of his genre, is willing to start arcs with endless setup for massive payoff in the end, and the amount of effort that goes into the construction of his story. For the three years that this aired, only Shirobaku and Haikyuu ever displaced it from my #1 spot.  
* Katanagatari  A super unique story that clearly lays out its adventure plans (12 swords, 12 enemies, 12 episodes, 12 months of airing) and then gives its all to make the most interesting anime within these constraints.  
Legend of the Galactic Heroes  The massive space epic took quite a while to really get into, but then it gripped me like almost nothing else.  
* Madoka  Why can't Homura have nice things :(  
* Monster  A really impactful thriller. I can't really explain why, it just uses your emotions really effectively.  
* Neon Genesis Evangelion  Probably the most impactful anime of the past 3 decades. It's also excellent.  
* Planetes  This is the single 'hardest' science fiction I've ever seen in any medium and it also happens to be an amazing character drama.  
* Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen  A very tight action/tragedy with great fight choreography, music, and a very dramatic story.  
* Samurai Champloo  Watanabe is a genius #2.  
* Shirobako  A must see for any anime fan. Extremely well done and really allows the audience to connect with the creators behind their favorite medium.  

Of course the distinction between high 9/10 and low 10/10 gets pretty arbitrary. I could easily see myself throwing GTO, NHK, Steins;Gate up there if I re-evaluated the list.

Elfen Lied and Claymore. I like them bloody, sexy and dramatic.
>> ARTICLE
I watched about half of Claymore, it was really good and I fully intend to finish it (one day) but sexy is not a word I would associate it with it. Is the second half notably different to the first in that regard?  
>> ARTICLE
Ah no, I was just saying that in general. Enjoy the rest with no fear, haha.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it's not like I'd *mind* if it got sexier.... 
>> ARTICLE
Yea I hear ya. Maybe try *Berserk* to scratch that itch... particularly the manga,  the classic anime doesn't do it justice. Just like Claymore, lots of demons and big swords, but also (brutal) sex and nudity.

So I've actually got a ton of 10s.  I feel very generous, but these pretty much pushed all of the right buttons... My planned to watch list is pretty extensive also, many of which are movies.

For an anime to be worth 10/10, it either has to have nothing I don't like about it, or any shortcomings have to be completely overshadowed by the stuff I do like.

Anime I consider perfect:  
Monster  
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann  
Space Dandy S2  
Dead Leaves  
5 Centimetres per Second

Anime where the good outweighs the bad:  
Code Geass  
Clannad After Story

Madoka Magica Rebellion

* Shingeki no Kyojin
>> ARTICLE
Since I have 29(a few are 2 seasons of the same show) 10/10s(262 completed), I'll just post my top 15.(I rate based on how much I enjoyed an anime, less to do with animation, character development, story, etc. However those things when done right only add to my enjoyment.)

TOP 15:

* Gintama

* TTGL

* Katanagatari

* Baccano!

* Hunter X Hunter(2011)

* Mushishi

* Shinsekai Yori

Oh, hey, someone else who gave Owari a 10. None of the people I know gave it a 10. I was very saddened by that.
>> ARTICLE
I think it gets overshadowed by Monogatari SS - I can say that I enjoyed Monogatari SS more than Owari, but that doesn't mean I can't just give both of them 10s. Owari was amazing too.

Just Steins;Gate and Monogatari SS; I am super conservative with my 10's.

Currently only Your lie in April, I made all the previous 10's a 9, just so I could show my affection for the show. I don't care when people say it's melodrama or whatever, this show was perfection to may. Perfection that made me cry like a little bitch.

Edit: If we are also talking about light novels/Manga. Then I have both HakoMari and Oregairu as 10/10. Everyone should seriously read HakoMari if they haven't already
>> ARTICLE
Its melodrama. I can see why people rate it so high, but its not for me. If I did play the piano, I'd probably give it a 9 or 10

Not particularly original choices, but hey, maybe I'll manage to find another one at some point.
>> ARTICLE
Does that mean you automatically give every new entry in the Monogatari series a 10? Any plans to re-evaluate it once it's over or are you satisfied that the highs of the series far out weigh missteps it has, or might in the future, make? 
>> ARTICLE
I've only given monogatari s2 and bake monogatari 10s, the rest are mostly 9's, and maybe 1 is an 8
>> ARTICLE
This is a rather difficult question to answer, both because of the way I rate things and my view of the Monogatari Series in particular. I've partially written and deleted it a few times already, so I'm going to opt for simplicity at the cost of detail and nuance.

Basically, it's not *quite* automatic, but in effect it may as well be. For a new installment to get a different rating, it would need some major underlying difference (or to feel thoroughly out of place) so that I can mentally divorce it from the prior installments. But the structure of the Monogatari Series is such that both of these seem quite unlikely. It's diverse in certain ways, so there's a low standard for conformity with the existing pieces, and everything is already told in a semi-distributed fashion, so a new piece doesn't need to fall into a set place that was waiting for it (like a sequel to a linear story does).

As for reevaluations, any rewatch (of which there will be many) will function as one. But as you can probably tell from the above, it's not likely to make a difference.

Personally I believe if you have a 10/10 anime then you have a problem, because then why ever watch anything else? Surely a true 10/10 anime should be infinitely re-watchable and be constantly enjoyable to watch. An anime being 10/10 means it is impossible to improve upon in any way. I can't think of any show that exists which couldn't do with a tad bit more characterisation here or an up in animation quality there. 

So that's why I have no 10/10 anime. But a whole lot if shows I think are great.

Having literally finished Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood 3 minutes ago:

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone's mentioning Brotherhood and I'm only on episode 15 of the first series. And apparently it has a really shit ending. Not looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
I can confirm that the ending sucks but it's might a little bit better by the movie sequel... a little bit.
>> ARTICLE
You may just want to bail on the first series. They changed the storyline because the manga wasnt finished yet and it went nutters. Brotherhood follows the manga as closely as any anime I've ever seen and its a million times better than the originally aired FMA.
>> ARTICLE
DO NOT BAIL. It will still be enjoyable. You will genuinely enjoy watching it. If you stop, watch brotherhood, and come back, it will be like a leftover reheated hot dog.

Plus the beginning of brotherhood tells the tale of half of the first series in many less episodes. 

So just enjoy it while you haven't seen anything.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've researched about it and stuff and people say that I should just watch Brotherhood, but I really like the first series so far. I want to get the bad ending over with so I can fully enjoy and understand Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that the two series share a lo of content at the beginning. And I loved the original series... until about half way through and I began saying wtf is going on, why is this suddenly such shit and culminated in an epic turd. Thats when I found out the manga wasnt even finished and caught up on it until it was finished. When I saw brotherhood I watched it with friends who had no knowledge of FMA and I was so pleased they stayed so true to the manga. So again, original series is a giant waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say shitty but rather it leaves many things open and unresolved. 
>> ARTICLE
Trust me, keep watching FMA, because it really is good, but in my opinion Brotherhood is so much better that you will never be able to go back to the 2003 series, so you might as well enjoy both series to the maximum possible amount.
>> ARTICLE
I concur, why deprive yourself of a pretty dang good show?

It's not bad, Brotherhood is just *better* IMO
>> ARTICLE
On episode 41 right now, and goddamn has this thread encouraged me to keep on binge-watching this. 
>> ARTICLE
That was probably the most satisfied an Anime has ever left me after all was said in done. I thought to myself:

*Damn, that's exactly how it should have went down*
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised that there weren't more people that said this. It was just soo satisfying how it tied up everything together. I love that series.
>> ARTICLE
Right? It's such a complete closure that it made me start a thread :D

Zero Requiem
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I should watch it for the third time someday.
>> ARTICLE
I think the soundtrack compliments it perfectly as well. Just listening to Continued Story makes me really nostalgic. I'm going to end up re-watching that ending...then the whole series probably!
>> ARTICLE
Is this anime worth watching?
>> ARTICLE
Yup, even if you dont like mechs.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't care less about mechs but Code Geass is my favorite anime and I also love TTGL and NGE...
>> ARTICLE
Yes Code Geass is very worth watching.

>> ARTICLE
Will always love that ending

Anohana
>> ARTICLE
Even if it depressed the hell out of me, yeah. It was a great ending. Can't wait for the movie.
>> ARTICLE
Hey I didn't say it was a happy ending. :P I cried like a baby, but it felt good.. very little was left unanswered and the main goals were met so nothing felt pointless or like a waste.
>> ARTICLE
Hey I thought it was a beyond happy ending, it was just very emotional.
>> ARTICLE
I think the ending of Steins;Gate gave a lot of closure. (Note: not the ending of the series itself, but the ending of the OVA and later on the movie are what give the series closure.)

Also Toradora!, I couldn't have wished for a better ending than that, it was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished re-watching Steins;Gate today.  Loved every second of it.

>christina even shows signs of having subconscious/hidden memories

I'd still consider that a pretty 'open' ending though. She has these hidden memories, but will they stay hidden? [Will she](/s "do something with these memories, or will Okabe's love for her stay unrequited? You can speculate what you want, and even though it's at that point likely that his love will be requited, it's still not confirmed, thus it's an open ending.")

Watch the OVA it answers it.

As far as narrative goes, [**The Tatami Galaxy**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei) has one of the best endings I've seen out of any medium. The series is a bizarre mess of parables and ideas and seeing them come together in a brilliant mosaic makes it really outstanding. Anybody who's seen it knows exactly what I mean- the finale is absolutely top notch. Here's a [little blurb about the series](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1pxf5i/i_have_two_weeks_until_i_leave_for_two_years/cd74um8) that I wrote on /r/animesuggest.

The final episode of [**Shinsekai Yori**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) is really stellar. Without spoiling the series, not only does is provide complete closure in telling what is essentially the protagonist's complete life story, it also succeeds in suggesting entirely different reinterpretations of the narrative as a whole. While the series definitely had its ups and downs (no new news for A-1 Pictures), the little bit at the very end when it cuts through all the characters introduced throughout the series was one of the most jaw-droppingly beautiful, haunting, and memorable moments of the entire year. [The little blurb from above](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1pxf5i/i_have_two_weeks_until_i_leave_for_two_years/cd74um8) also has a bit on *Shinsekai Yori* as well.

[**Tsuritama**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12883/Tsuritama), another A-1 Pictures work, would be my lesser known choice. While the series definitely gets a little bit crazy by the end, the ending is quite grand to a different scale. There's a lot I could praise about the series, but most of it is covered in [a small post I wrote 3-4 months ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1oy4pl/whats_an_anime_series_that_you_personally_rate/ccwuzv9)
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching Shinsekai Yori today, and I could not agree more. The ending was fantastic. Everything came to an awesome close and all the loose ends were tied up. I was extremely satisfied.
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori was one of the most boring anime's I've ever seen (mainly due to it's pacing), but had one of the most OMGWTFHOLYMMMMM endings I've ever seen in any medium. I'd say the boring grind was worth it, because that ending was a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Tsuritama was a lot of fun to watch, very enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you that The Tatami Galaxy's ending was superb. It wrapped up everything so well while leaving the future wide open. Combining that with its beautiful visual style and unique presentation makes it one of my all-time favourites.

SSY just left me... mad. Sure, the worldbuilding was incredible and they took us on one hell of a journey, but the ending was frustrating.
[Shinsekai Yori spoilers](/s "Everything and everyone is still awful. The queerats are still slaves. All of the innocence and wonder at the start of the show was ripped away and we're left with the two remaining characters who had singlehandedly quelled any hope the queerat race had to ever achieve meaningful lives. Humanity is morally bankrupt and we're left with a vague hope that things might get better. Maybe.")
>> ARTICLE
[Shinseka Yori spoilers](/s "That's the point. It's realistic like that. Its how their entire society WORKS and its against human nature to accept change. Saki, with the ability to live for hundreds of years, is going to slowly have an impact on the way society has become as she becomes more and more powerful politically. The problem is that, even though Saki eventually has the ability to change society, what can she actally do? Although their methods ARE cruel, think about WHY their society is like that. It's only to protect the human race so that they can continue living. If karma demons and w/e aren't eradicated, humanity would cease to exist.")
>> ARTICLE
[More Shinsekai Yori Spoilers](/s "Yeah, I get that there are good reasons behind the murky morality. But that doesn't really extend to the fate of the queerats. It's tragic, and the real tragedy is in how quick and offhand the revelation of their genetic origin is. The kantos-weilding humans are essentially the bad guys, which is a prety awful revelation.")

[](/s "I suppose the ending is realistic, and the more I think about it the more it the more it makes sense. I was just foolishly hoping for some kind of happy resolution until the last minute, against all odds. Instead we got an ending so bittersweet it hurts.")

I have a major love/hate relationship with this show. ._.
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori also had a pretty badass ED... good closure for every episode of the first half of the season.

Code Geass has the best closure IMO, the ending is very emotional and makes alot of sense, and it makes it so even the "open" edges don't really matter, still makes me think after years.

It has a great ending, yes, but I'd question the sense of it. It feels very naive of Lulu to think the way he though about the matter.

Go figure, I'm rewatching it right now. I love it.

I was going to bring this up too. That ending was truly amazing.

It's one of those shows that just nails it hardcore the whole way through. Makes that ending that much better.

I even don't *really mind* the school/fanservicy stuff. Which usually turns me off right away. I consider that an achievement.

I thought Baccano! ended with closure.

I thought Baccano! began with closure.

The Tatami Galaxy has tons of that sweet, sweet closure that you desire so much.

Another example would be the Kara no Kyoukai movie series.
>> ARTICLE
[CardCaptor Sakura](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=102) - The second movie ended it absolutely right where it needed to end.  Considering it was by far the most popular anime in Japan at the time, I applaud Madhouse and CLAMP for not trying to just keep the series going with random new series like 'What happened after' or 'Sakura as an adult'.  Which the fanbase would have eaten up...but would have hurt the series in the long run.  As Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicles later proved.

[Princess Tutu](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=516) - A series with not one, but two amazing endings for both seasons.  But counting the actual second season ending, it wrapped up the entire story perfectly.  And showed that you could have a bitter-sweet 'ballet' style ending that was still entirely satisfying.  As if it was the only ending that would have worked.

[Cross Game](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=6424) - An anime which broke all the conventions of what it is to be a typical Sports anime ends with every character story being resolved completely.  And the Tsundere actually meeting a full 'Dere' transition.
>> ARTICLE
Well I know it's against popular opinion but I thought Spice and Wolf had great clo-*shot*

In all seriousness though...

* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

* Clannad

* Cowboy Bebop

* Samurai Champloo

* Death Note

* Katanagatari

* Mawaru Penguindrum

* My Bride is a Mermaid

* Steins;Gate

* Future Diary

All close out perfectly with fantastic ending episodes. Katanagatari and My Bride is a Mermaid take the cake for best ending episodes I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
I personally strongly disliked the ending of Future Diary. It felt so cheap and gimmicky to me.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people didn't like Clannad's ending either (even if I did actually and thought it played really well into the story's most important themes and messages).

Whether or not you liked it, it sealed all of it's important loose ends.

The Redial OVA was... pretty bad in comparison to the anime (which even for it's flaws, I thought was pretty great), but it still gave the closure that the last 2 seconds of the anime hinted at.

Personally I would have preferred it to have ended tragically. You can have a tragic end and still feel satisfied with the piece, Madoka Magica has a horribly depressing ending yet I still think it's one of the strongest ending episodes to date. Though since Rebellion came out and it's probably going to continue venturing into what it left behind I didn't add it to the list.

I can never get tired of re-watching this show.
>> ARTICLE
>Katanagatari

Seconded.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. Katanagatari has one of the most fulfilling endings ever. Both bad ass and bittersweet. Just well fitting for the series as a whole.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I've heard the ending was out of left field and was warned it would leave a bitter taste in my mouth. I got the impression it was completely out of place with the rest of the series.

I'm just hesitant to watch it because of this but that visual style looks brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
Well whoever told you that is a liar. The ending was one of the best I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
i liked TTGL's ending. i mean it was sad but it felt right and final. of course it could go another way but i honestly did not have any regrets or what ifs after the final episode
>> ARTICLE
TTGL's ending is the perfect, "the hero doesn't always win everything" ending.

I especially liked when they showcased him when he had gotten older and was talking to the boy about how the next generation is succeeding him. You would think he would be the most legendary human to have ever lived, but that isn't always the reality even for the most accomplished people. The next generation will come around and do something great themselves and it will be their time to shine.

I really liked that and it played really well into what TTGL spent so much time going on about.
>> ARTICLE
i especially liked what they did with Nia and Simon because everyone else was sad that Nia had to go as a result of destroying the Anti-Spiral but Simon and Nia accepted that this was their fate. it's rare to have a series kill a beloved character in the end and it not be sad but more a cause for celebration. it's good they did not making her departure some sobfest for Simon - shows a real man quality.

Mirai Nikki with the addition of the redial OVA was pretty satisfying.

I agree. My felt Mirai Nikki's ending was great. Even without the redial part [spoiler](/s "assuming they just ended it with Yuki seeing the Yuno dies message") I felt that ending would be fitting of the series too.  The redial ending though was perfect though.

The last chapter of the manga makes the closing even better.

How different is the last chapter of the manga from the redial OVA? I thought the redial OVA was animating that last chapter.

Shuffle! that had good closure, harem where one girl is picked and follows through until the end? I can agree with that, and it was the one I was rooting for even though I wasn't sure if she had a chance.

Best girl is Kaede and we all know it.

C'mon, deep down you know you can't resist [those eyes](http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/8900000/Kaede-Fuyou-shuffle-8916834-433-360.jpg).

Completely real here though, Kaede made the entire anime worth watching to me completely by herself. Sia was 2nd and still note worthy but Kaede's arc just blew everyone out of the fucking water so intensely that I would have been fine if the anime was just about her and the other girls didn't ever exist.

I will give it to Shuffle! though that while probably the most boring, plain, and melodramatic girl wins I will say that it's nice to see a harem actually pick a winner for once.
>> ARTICLE
I'll admit kaede has the single best grumpy face I have ever seen, sis was second followed by kaede on my list, but I just couldn't get over how she went pretty crazy with the yandere for a few episodes, if she hadn't done batshit insane she would have won. Never stick your dick in crazy, my motto so I could not justify giving kaede first. 
>> ARTICLE
Eureka Seven (forget AO) probably the best closure, never have I felt like a show did a good job closing an anime until that one and i was satisfied. It didn't need anymore it was good and done! (FORGET AO PLS)

Yup without AO closure with AO... it just messes up all the closure. Open ended and terrible destruction of characters.

When i read your questionFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was also the first title I had to think of. There were a whole bounch of anime I've seen that had very satisfying endings.

[Now and Then, Here and There] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_and_Then,_Here_and_There)

One of the most brutally sad anime up until the last episode where the entire journey suddenly felt worth it

Scrapped Princess also ended on a pretty satisfying note 
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised to see someone mention Now & Then, Here & There. I loved it when it was on Anime Network's On Demand (back when they were trying to build the cable network portion up). It also introduced me to Grey DeLisle, who is easily the sexiest-sounding voice actress ever next to maybe Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

It's one of my all time favorites, it's a shame it doesn't get the recognition it deserves

*Zetsuen no Tempest* (Especially satisfying and, I suppose, clever of the writers given the theme of the show)

Each season of -*monogatari* I've watched has, while leaving the overarching story open-ended, had a very satisfying conclusion to it.

*Kamisama no Memochou*: many series have left me with a sense of satisfied contentment, but few have combined that with ASMR.

*Colorful* was an sublime dramatic journey, whose ending was everything it should have been.
>> ARTICLE
Zetsuen no Tempest's ending was perfect except for the fact that I loved the series so much it really could have been another minute just to confirm what was pretty much either left open or made obvious, but it didn't need to do that to be perfect closure. Still, though, I wanted to see them kiss.

Agreed. The first season ended perfectly. I swear gunslinger girl is the wierdst thing I have actually seen; "little girls assasinating people, but wait they are also cyborgs who are brainwashed" and then they take it so seriously it almost becomes a deconstruction. It's great, an example of the idea that with hard work any premise can be made into an interesting show.

Just finished Honey and Clover. I think the closure you get goes hand in hand with what the show tries to say about love and relationships. Your mileage may vary but I thought it was one of the best.

Hmm...I'll have to watch it again, but for me, the first season was a lot better than the second.  The ending, in my opinion, was kind of weak...and nothing got resolved.

What do you think was left unresolved? I thought literally everything was resolved so I'm not really sure where to start.

After War Gundam X had a really nice ending and I was completely content with it. Good series if you want the art of Gundam Wing with overall better characters and storytelling.

Since the Tatami galaxy has already been said Katanagatari for sure. The last episode is so all out and [](/s "the final fight is a perfect one on all brawl with enough epic to be a true climax for the series")
>> ARTICLE
I started looking trough the lists to see what shows left me impressed with their endings and I've realized there aren't that many and most of which have already been mentioned (Tatami Galaxy, Gankutsuou, Kyousougiga, Shinsekai Yori, School days, FMA:B). I mean I've seen only 200 or so different shows, but I can't say I've seen that many with good endings which stand out. It might be that I am pretty new to it (I haven't seen pretty much anything from 90's or before that), but way too many shows are just "buy the source material to know what happens next" or have anime original ending. 
>> ARTICLE
Clannad ended nicely, also I was satisfied with the ending of Trigun.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass has a phenomenally satisfying ending, as does, despite the numerous problems with the rest of the show, Sword Art Online. I would argue that while [Cowboy Bebop's ending is ] (/s "VERY open, (Bang), it also provides immensely satisfying closure to the main plotline")

I think clannad after story along with angel beats gave me good closure with the characters.

Arkada's got this spot-on IMO. No matter what anyone says, I will never see (2003) or Brotherhood as solo series. 

But you really need to see (2003) for character and other spoilerish reasons before Brotherhood and you can't really watch (2003) without watching Brotherhood later to get closure or seeing how it's supposed to end. As if the writers knew this and tried going a different direction and focus on the second half, which wouldn't suprise me.

If I say my third favorite anime is FMA I mean both cause honestly it wouldn't have made it in my top 5 if I haven't seen 1 or the other since honestly they're both pretty lacking in some categories or there's something I preferred in one that I didn't get in the other. It pretty much flushes away most criticism I can have by having 2 series.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I think I fucked up getting into anime with this being my first anime I've seen. Everything afterwards has been good yea sure but only a few anime have given me the same feeling as I did in fma brotherhood 
>> ARTICLE
You saved yourself from a ton of mediocrity, you didn't fuck up at all
>> ARTICLE
There's probably a way to see some parts of 2003 and then jump to Brotherhood but it'd be silly to only watch 2003 for that and then ignoring the rest since it's still pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
I would say watch the first 25 episodes of the 2003 series.  Then you can catch up to where it leaves off in like 8-10 episodes of brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually impossible since even from the beginning there are slight differences between both that become more important later on.
>> ARTICLE
No, the idea is you watch the first 25 episodes of 2003, and then you start from the beginning with Brotherhood.

Imo it's completely silly since you're skipping over 26 good-to-great anime episodes. But if for some irrational reason you really want to that's probably better than only watching Brotherhood and missing out on the more detailed and better paced adaptation of the first half of the 2003 series.

(Honestly, imo if you're at that level you should just read the manga and then watch brotherhood to see it animated.)
>> ARTICLE
Ohhhh I thought you meant you skip to espisodes 8-10 of brotherhood. Now I get it.
>> ARTICLE
The 2003 series and Brotherhood tend to compliment each other fairly well.  The 2003 series has a much better first half whereas brotherhood has a debatably better second half.  
So when you say FMA is your 3rd favorite anime do you mean brotherhood or the 2003 series?  Or both together?

>> ARTICLE
What do you mean by second half? Because as soon as both anime separate themselves Brotherhood is definitely better and it still has 50 episodes left

Warning: May cause you to clap and touch random surfaces *just in case*
>> ARTICLE
One of my favourites and for good reason to, Ed and mustang are high on my best character list. Both had character arcs which felt pretty well rounded and versed. Filled with anger, regret, closure etc. There's a reason why this anime is hyped up so much, which it lives up to.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one that doesn't really like GR?

I can honestly see some of his points during reviews being valid. I can't take that from him.

But aside from his review style, I dislike his opinions. I don't know if sometimes it's because of them being in character or not, but sometimes it's just either over the top for me or just something with a reasoning I can't get behind.

But they do have a following, so I am in no way trying to discredit their accountability.
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't mean that you should dislike him. That's why I love to watch people's reviews, so I can hear other people's thoughts on a show I enjoyed. It just makes it more interesting for me if they have different opinions. What's the point of hearing someone say the same thing I already think?


>> ARTICLE
I'm not hating on the guy. I'm not disregarding the validity of his ideas and opinions either.

When I want to know other people's opinions I tend to read those opinions from their reviews on their anime list and I pool together several reviews. Other times I don't watch reviews or read them because I wanna go into a show unclouded and when I end up liking that show, I read a review and it turns out many people hated it.

Guilty Crown is one such example and I constantly get flak on here for liking it.

One thing about hearing someone say what you already think could be validation of your thoughts. Other than that, it's great to always hear other opinions.

But GR is just not my cup of tea.
>> ARTICLE
IMO, I generally like his review style and he is regular and prolific in the shows he reviews. I may have watched one or two anime due to them too.

However his reviews have some obvious biases where I have the opposite viewpoint. He tends to talk about dubs, I only consider watching dubs under specific circumstances (when it fits the theme of the show / the show is decidedly western AND the dub is good - Space Dandy, Cowboy Bebop are examples). 

He also places an importance on the ending which is bewildering and strikes me as naive in the anime world. Most anime are advertisements of the original material and as a fan you need to come to terms with the fact that the vast majority will not be adapted to completion. I guess both my points are a kind of originality bias: I tend to judge works based on the original source when possible. A dubbed adaptation is far from it IMO. For example, I judge Railgun as a series based on its excellent Manga rather than the butchered JC Staff adaptation. 

In the context of this review, my obvious bias would be towards Brotherhood, seeing that I also read the FMA manga. Another problem is that he recommends watching two adaptation of the same series here while being averse to long anime. It is strange.
>> ARTICLE
I might like it more if he didn't stand so close to the camera. It just feels weird him being all up in my grill. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I feel exactly the same way. It's not that his videos are bad or he doesn't make valid points in a lot of them, I just find myself disagreeing with his opinions relatively often.
>> ARTICLE
Glad I'm not the only one.
>> ARTICLE
I don't always agree with him, but I like to see things from other people's perspectives. The point of reviews isn't to reaffirm your opinion.
>> ARTICLE
its good to see multiple different opinions, a notion which this subreddit (and reddit in general) struggle with
>> ARTICLE
With that, you're spot on. A while back I got so much hate and some guy just constantly insulting me and being a condescending ass just because I said I liked Guilty Crown.
>> ARTICLE
And if you say you don't like shows like Monogatari or Madoka Magica here you just get sent to downvote hell.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not vocal about it, but I don't like Madoka. Just not my cup of tea.

Monogatari is alright.
>> ARTICLE
All reviewers have opinions, of course your gonna disagree with some of them.  I also disagree with some of GR's opinions.
>> ARTICLE
But regardless of that, I feel that I'd watch it more if he had something else. I just can't put my finger on it.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
He did mention that the FMA:B review would specifically be in the context of comparing it with FMA:2003.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't he mention that he would be comparing Brotherhood to the 2003 series at the beginning of the video....
>> ARTICLE
I do not understand how he thinks the voice for Alphonse was exactly the same in Brotherhood as in 2003. I watched 2003 for the first time a couple years ago and immediately went to brotherhood for more... but I had a problem. The voice for Alphonse in the dub for me was so drastically different from 2003 I couldn't handle it, it's literally the only reason I dropped and have put off watching this series for a very long time. Her voice sounds extremely higher pitched and more feminine than 2003 VA and while I'm sure the performance was great I just couldn't tolerate the shock of the change in his voice and so I stopped watching.

Honestly if you go and listen to them both one after the other it's freaking night and day I don't get how he could think they were exactly the same.

Otherwise I would agree with many of his opinions on the series and there relationships, and will probably get around to finishing brotherhood eventually.
>> ARTICLE
You could always watch it subbed.
>> ARTICLE
I would enjoy this show more without knowing how overrated it is. I actually think it's perfectly good, but it shocks me that this is considered one of the best things called anime. It's a high quality series with very broad appeal, which is probably what skews its consistent aura of "greatest of all time". I don't mean to insult the show, it's just very surprising how universally acclaimed the show is to the point of being a kind of king of the medium.
>> ARTICLE
If other people's liking a show more than you influences your feelings on a show negatively, its your loss really and it sounds really narcissistic. Like people are only allowed to only hype up shows that you deem worthy
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you know what narcissistic means. It's just a big word you want to use. Arrogant bitch isn't as fancy, but it is more appropriate for what you were probably going for.

Calling something overrated doesn't mean I think it's awful. This is a thread about a review of the show(s), so you shouldn't be shocked that someone might be, in some possible way, critical of the show. So yes, I guess everyone can be super butthurt that I called it overrated and just gush praise everywhere, or we can be honest.
>> ARTICLE
No i went with narcissistic cause that's what it sounds like. Narcissism is having or showing an excessive interest in or admiration of oneself which also means your own opinions. Having said that in contrast to your feelings on a show be based on your own opinions and how they contrast with the larger anime community. Being as they don't line up since you think FMA:B is "high quality" while everyone else feels it is the "greatest of all time". Since your opinions didn't line up your enjoyment of the show went down. Sounds like a narcissistic hipster

Also Arrogant bitch isn't what I would use because you aren't acting like a bitch but i guess arrogant works.
>> ARTICLE
My post was, I thought, obviously an invitation for someone to make the case that the show really does live up to the insane amount of hype it has received. You've chosen to interpret my presence as publicly flaunting my supposed high admiration for my own opinion. Generally narcissism doesn't invite discussion especially if it was incredibly predictable that fans of the show would get irrationally upset with me and challenge my supposed "self admiration" and the value of my opinions. If I wanted to feed some supposed narcissism I wouldn't intentionally pick a place where I could be challenged on something and also invite opposing views.
>> ARTICLE
No it wasn't all you said was that you felt like it was over hyped and over praised. You didn't articulate why you felt that way so someone could have some reply to it. There isn't much left to what you said other than "I thought it was great but people thought it was the greatest anime of all time but i didn't, so I don't like it as much anymore". Saying it was inviting discussion about FMA:B and why it would be praised just isn't true.
>> ARTICLE
> Saying it was inviting discussion about FMA:B and why it would be praised just isn't true.

Lol Okay. I think one SINGLE reply actually focused on the show rather than myself, so none of you clearly have much to say about the show anyways I guess.
>> ARTICLE
As my above comment has stated, your initial comment does nothing to stimulate the discussion. What are we supposed to do circlejerk about how much we like the show? If you had said you didn't like X about the show we could of said our opinions on it, but you didn't so you get bunch of replies about how you shouldn't base your opinions based on how others enjoyed the show.
>> ARTICLE
Not really. It's not a big word man, it's not even an insult. And you proved his argument right with this reply.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, why do you even care what others think about it? You should decide for yourself what you like and what not. 
>> ARTICLE
I already have decided. I only watched the shows a few years ago because of their massive praise, and I was underwhelmed that the shows didn't live up to that praise. That's a normal reaction to that kind of thing, and that is exactly what makes something overrated. I'm sorry you're butthurt that I don't think this is the best show on earth and that anyone could be surprised that it's constantly considered to be.
>> ARTICLE
Huh? Why am I suddenly butthurt?

I am not a hypocrite who doesnt listen to what he tells others...
Like I said I couldnt care less about what people think about my favorite shows. 

IMO its your own fault if you watched it with too high expectations and its kinda pretentiousto say something is overrated just because you didnt like it. 
>> ARTICLE
> IMO its your own fault if you watched it with too high expectations and its kinda pretentiousto say something is overrated just because you didnt like it.

You have trouble reading.

* I never said I didn't like the show
* You just defined what it means for something to be overrated.
* Additionally, I don't need to preface everything I say with "in my opinion" because that is always implied in discussions about art.
* No art exists without context or in a vacuum. Our opinions about art are inevitably and unavoidably affected by the people we interact with and the cultures we live in. Our opinions on a piece of art can be affected by where and when we experienced the art and under what pretenses we did so. In other words, if the only anime I ever watched was Shounen, then in that context FMA might rank right at the top for me. But it's not, so it isn't.

>> ARTICLE
Oh sorry then I should have added "as much as the rest". 

Also IMO ;) overrated can/should only be applied to something if the majority of the people dont rate it as high as what you heard first. Every other use just sounds, well pretentious.

About that last point. I firmly believe that everyone should overcome his prejudices and pretenses when viewing any kind of art. So why care if its shonen or seinen? Those are nothing more than meaningless tags that are entirely subjective.
>> ARTICLE
>  It's a high quality series with very broad appeal

There's your answer. To be frank, you're stupid if you can't see why it's so highly regarded. To look at a show with such high overall quality and extremely wide appeal (to the point where multiple people I know who refuse to watch anime hold it up as one of the best shows they've ever seen), and then call it overrated is asinine.

No, it's not overrated. It's *highly rated* by *many, many people.* There is a difference. The ratings that Brotherhood receives are rarely undeserved, and when they are, it's not really enough to call it overrated. Let's put it this way - **538,000** MAL users can't all be wrong, and the fraction of them that are wrong (which is subjective anyway) is so small that they could realistically be discarded as outliers and extremes.

>  to the point of being a kind of king of the medium

There's a reason it's regarded that way, and like I said, you already answered your question. To find a story as well put-together and heartfelt as FMA's is rare enough on its own. Couple that with a good anime adaptation and (as previously mentioned) extremely wide appeal, and it deserves its spot at the top for not sacrificing anything for the sake of quality.
>> ARTICLE
First of all, why do other's opinions affect your enjoyment of the show? Make your own judgement about it. On another note, what exactly would you consider to be the best of all time? Their are only 2 or 3 that even come close for me including these two, which I judge as one show.
>> ARTICLE
What would you consider the greatest anime of all time then?

I am sincerely curious, but I'm pretty sure what it just comes down to is that you prefer different genres and styles. Within [serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_(radio_and_television\)) shounen adventure shows, FMA is one of the best and definitely the best of its generation. Considering it *the* best is a case of personal preference, and probably comes down to how old you were and how much anime you'd seen at the time when you first saw FMA.

>> ARTICLE
no it crushes the wills of those *much* weaker than the user. none of these people strike me as falling in that category. the fishmen were all pretty weak and luffy only knocked out like a third of them. 
>> ARTICLE
Idk, Truth-absorbed Father was pretty strong, despite being unstable. He was unable to kill FMAB's main characters within ~5 minutes because [FMAB Spoiler](/s "Hohenheim's philosopher's stone was being used fully defensively, while the army and several characters were spamming attacks at Father; he couldn't use offense and defense together effectively enough to take them all down. Then he couldn't contain his power anymore after a short duration").  

He could probably just disintegrate Luffy in a second with a hydrogen nuclear fusion reaction (the sun-like thing he had), since Luffy doesn't have a philosopher's stone to defend himself. I don't think the Emperor's Haki would work against Truth. 

If Luffy managed to spam attacks at Father for over 5 minutes non-stop, while not putting any of his limbs near Father (by throwing things), then he might be able to stall out the absorption. But since all of Luffy's attacks are melee, I'd expect him to fail.
>> ARTICLE
Aside from just over powering his mind with emperor haki, I think regular haki and his sheer speed in 2nd gear would protect him.  No one in FMAB moves nearly as fast as Luffy/people generally do in One Piece,  if Luffy can deflect/ignore the Ceaser Clown's energy blasts and punch a guy made out of light in the face with ease I think Father would have a time about it.    I guess it really depends if a Haki fist could survive getting near him and hit his "core" like it is supposed to.   If 2nd Gear Haki Bullet punches work Father would be a world of pain, if they didn't Luffy would be but i dunno even then I think Luffy is just more imaginative than Father..
>> ARTICLE
Luffy would definitely find himself in some trouble if one of Father's attacks actually connected. I recall Father having fused with god at that point, so his attack power and perceptiveness, along with his transmutation skill, would be amplified substantially. But even then, if you're comparing universes, Luffy is a lot faster than Father, and his attacks hit really hard, too. Also, the fact that Luffy's entire body is made of rubber might throw Father for a loop before he realized it, and I don't even know if Armament Haki is made of anything transmutable, really. Either outcome is pretty fair game.

What is it about Steins Gate that makes people hype it as one of the best?
>> ARTICLE
What is it about steins gate that you don't enjoy? Some people dislike the early pacing, some people don't like the Characters, but the story is really stream lined, crisp, and self-contained. Timelines are very well fleshed out, and the 22 episodes of the primary story are almost completely void of filler. Vocal performances in both sub and dub are high quality. Art is relatively good. But the story really is special. Time travel is easy to fuck up, and having a quality story contained so well is a rarity. If you like quality scifi stories, you should love stein's;gate. If you don't, that's okay. But it's one of the best scifi stories in anime up there with shinsekai yori.

Not sure about others, but I really dislike that [](/s "it has a happy ending"). Might be because I've grown tired of watching so many of them, but there's plenty of anime that could've been even better if it wasn't for that.

Clannad AS and Stein's:Gate could both have ended earlier and possibly have been better for it. If Clannad cuts at him collapsing to the ground, way better for me. If Stein's ends at Mayuri speaks to Okabe 22, I could be happy with that too.

For Clannad it wouldn't make a difference for me, to be honest. It isn't that type of anime which would change if it had a different ending. The hard hitting scenes were before the ending took place, therefore I look at it just as an alright way to end it.
>> ARTICLE
ty for answering   
As you pointed out "the early pacing, some people don't like the Characters" (which is the reason i dropped it) and only the story holding the anime which is kinda bad compared to other animes that have all great aspects but doesn't get noticed while this one is hyped as hell.   
Let me turn it around, shouldn't one of the best animes be good in all points?
>> ARTICLE
> Let me turn it around, shouldn't one of the **best** animes be good in all points?

Not really. There can be good animes that are among the best but that are not a must watch. Unless you meant to say must watch animes instead of best animes.

Every person will have their own way of looking at it. I, personally, wouldn't say something is a must watch solely from the enjoyment standpoint but other people probably would.

The issue is that people treat "Must Watch" lists as "Worth Watch".You see this whole Steins;Gate debate very often because it is a really enjoyable show (perhaps great starter anime) but it has its flaws. But having flaws is good because you can compare an anime to another based on who did X element better.

In hindsight, Steins Gate can be perceived as really slow and it has some other minor flaws but its plot twist was done better than many other animes that are on the "best" list and that is why I think it is one of the best ones but not good enough to be a must watch.
>> ARTICLE
Bro you misunderstand :D   
I was only asking about this particler anime and its hype, not about
his must watch list (anyone can give anything in their must watch list). Just that people see this as one of the best.
>> ARTICLE
As far as I'm concerned the pacing was amazing all through, but I enjoy character building and I enjoyed all the characters anyway. The complaints are not things I agree with. But I'm also someone who is completely put off by almost everything about TTGL, even though the world hypes the shit out of it, so I understand where you're coming from, even if I don't see your perspective.  
>> ARTICLE
ty for your opinion :)   
Seems like that I just don't like this particler anime and its hype xD
>> ARTICLE
Nothing wrong with that. We all have opinions, we're all different. I like the serious science bits in shows like this and planetes. Nothing out there says that has to be enough of a draw for you 
>> ARTICLE
>4	The Tatami Galaxy, One Piece, Baccano

Wow, all 3 of these anime seem massively ~~underrated~~ underwatched on this subreddit, particularly One Piece. Good to know. 
>> ARTICLE
I tried watching tatami galaxy but I got bored after the 2nd episode thinking it was just going to like endless eight but with slight variations. I can't do it unless someone tells me the middle episodes are interesting, have plot-progression or each one has some excellent meaning.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano underrated? What sub have you been browsing?

My bad, not sure why I used the word underrated. Meant to say unpopular.

It hurts so much seeing Suzumiya NOT on this list. Really, r/anime? I'm quite disappointed.

Yesterday I watched the first 3 episodes of 2012's JoJo and it is so good and the plot flows so well that when the screen went black in the middle of each episode I thought it had ended but there was 12 more minutes of awesomeness.

Been meaning to watch Nana sooner or later, bumped it up on my PTW list.

That Initial D love! Best soundtrack ever.

Going to go with things I think are important to the medium rather, unique, and has good messages, rather than just my favourite shows.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion**. One of the most popular, controversial, and revolutionary anime around. It's anime canon.


**Welcome to the NHK**. Anime, like pretty much anything, can be destructive. Don't go too far with otaku behaviour.

**Revolutionary Girl Utena**. Artistic, purposeful direction, symbolism, and it tackles many relevant relationship issues. Not everything needs to be told through overt plot elements.

Any Satoshi Kon movie. Personal favourite is **Perfect Blue**.

Any Masaaki Yuasa show. Personal favourite is Ping Pong The Animation. **The Tatami Galaxy** might resonate with more people, and is more what I'm going for with the art, so maybe that.

It was too hard to just pick 5. Watch Shirobako, Ghost in the Shell, FMA:B, Princess Mononoke, The Garden of Words, Cowboy Bebop, TTGL... I could go on. 
>> ARTICLE
I think must watch anime need to be foundation setters in both genre and effects on culture. So my 5 are:  
1. Neon Genesis Evangelion  
2. Madoka  
3. Gintama  
4. JoJo  
5. Hunter x Hunter/Berserk 

I'm leaving out the big shounen (One Piece/Naruto/Dragonball) as they are their own entity but they are essential to know of if you even get consider yourself as an anime fan.
>> ARTICLE
1. Cowboy Bebop  
2. Samurai Champloo  
3. Gurren Lagann  
4. Steins; Gate  
5. Code Geass  

In other words, pretty similar to a lot of other peoples' lists I'm guessing.
>> ARTICLE
why samurai champloo? i finished it a month ago and didn't find anything special about it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's almost as if different people had different opinions
>> ARTICLE
yeah that's why i asked why he picked it cuz i didnt understand it so i would like to know his reasoning behind it. I didn't mean to shittalk samurai champloo or anyone who likes it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I see, maybe this sub is starting to get to me when I automatically assume that legit questions were just plain shittalk. 

I can't speak for his reasoning, but I also love Samurai Champloo. The strong points in my opinion are the characters and character interactions, solid action scenes and all the hip hop culture references. Oh and almost forgot Nujabes.
>> ARTICLE
it's no point man, you're just preparing your salt for the upcoming best girl vote.
>> ARTICLE
Nostalgia

Even tho i liked it and like action anime in general, it really didnt hit me that much too. Would rate Berserk higher over Samurai Champloo
>> ARTICLE
Finished Gurren Lagann last night after a 2-day binge.  That ending really choked me up!  GL definitely skyrocketed to my top 3.
>> ARTICLE
5 seems impossible. I'll list ten instead for shows. I think this list has a bit of something for everyone.

-Serial Experiments Lain

-Legend of the Galactic Heroes

-Welcome To The NHK

-Princess Tutu

-Monster

-Oniisama E

-Great Teacher Onizuka

5. Steins;Gate
>> ARTICLE
**Cowboy Bebop** - The best anime I've seen so far, mature in many ways, I see no reason for someone who likes anime to miss it. Once you watch it, you're gonna carry that weight.

**Baccano!** - I don't necessarily think Baccano! would appeal to everyone, but I think everyone should at least give it a try. Unique storytelling, an excellent cast of likeable characters (minus Jacuzzi until now-I'll-stand-out-too scene), catchy opening and neverending action.

**Steins;Gate** - Story-wise the best anime I've seen so far. This definitely wasn't my opinion while watching most of the show, but last 3 episodes + OVA sealed the deal for me, everything gets fixed. TUTURU!

**Grave of the Fireflies** - I'm pretty sure this is the first anime I've watched since my childhood. It proves what an amazing medium anime can be, sending a very emotional and powerful message about the importance of society and terrors of war.

**Spirited Away** - This anime revealed how beautiful animation can be. I simply couldn't believe it, I'm not a person that gets emotional, but I cried tears of joy over this. Needless to say, SA and GotF made Ghibli my favorite animation studio. Aren't I special, huh? :p

Hunter x Hunter 2011 - one of the best shounen action animes there is but doesn't get as much recognition as it deserves. Unique darkish kind of theme despite being a shounen anime while still keeping that innocent shounen feeling to it, amazing animation, feels, incredible story, everything you could want and it's made well. There'll probably be a ton of people recommending HxH so even though it's an anime I could write a thousand lines about I'll put some more focus on Gintama.

Gintama - another shounen anime that doesn't get as much recognition as it deserves, maybe because the first episode of the series is slightly boring.

Gintama will make you laugh to death in almost every episode, if you're not laughing then you're either crying because of the massive feels or shaking because of the exciting battle scenes. Alot of people said that the first 20 episodes or so are pretty slow but I thought they were alright but from there it only gets beter and better. 

Gintama was rated at 9.15 on myanimelist so I decided to pick it up, the first episode was really boring imo so I decided to drop it. Half a year later or so a new season of Gintama came because there was apparently enough manga chapters to adapt a new season or something so I decided to watch the latest episode - the stories have many small arcs and there seems to be episodes that doesn't have an impact on the story at all, fortunately this was one of those episodes that had nothing to do with the story - it was just an episode that had me laugh to death after just a few minutes. After watching that episode I decided to pick up the anime again starting from episode 3 because episode 1-2 is a double episode. I was laughing quite a lot at the start but later it just got better and better, I took Gintama for the comedy type but I was mistaken. Some arcs could really tear you up and the battle arcs were amazing, it had me shaking of excitement.

You should definitely watch Gintama, even if you find it slightly boring at the beginning it gets way better after a while so make sure you continue, I promise you wont regret it.

In no particular order:

- Bartender (rarely mentioned slice of life which is pretty good. tackles each customer with a very calming atmosphere)

- Ping Pong : The Animation (abstract art style and amazing story. don't let the art style discourage you.)

- Tamako Market -> Tamako Love Story (great short romance story. Tamako Love Story is the movie continuation which is 10/10)

- Love Live! (entry to idol animes with great continuation after the anime (phone game and **lots** of music. you can either watch this or idolm@ster)

- Law of Ueki (shounen with very smart ways to interpret battles and defeat enemies instead of **plot sword and armor**)

I tried Ping Pong, I really did, but it's just so incredibly painful to watch that I couldn't continue.

This should cover a lot of genres, as entry level they are not too shabby, they are not insanely long so it might be easier for people to get started on them (not like some of the longer ones like HxH or FMA:B which might require a bit more dedication) and generally these are probably some of my favorites.

Else Shirobako, NGNL and nichijou might cover some other areas that the list was lacking.

Just mentioning a few that some might not have mentioned. I know everyone don't like sports anime, but both Cross Game and Ping Pong The Animation are about so much more than just sports. Wonderful characters. As for the other ones, Mushishi is a must watch just for the atmosphere and format, it is the only anime to make me feel something after every episode. Aria is the most relaxing anime ever, it heals your soul. Sakamichi no Apollon is my favorite Watanabe show by far with strong characters, realistic portrayal of relationships and lovely music.

**Relatively under-watched**

3. Space Brothers
4. Kaiji
5. Bakuman and/or Shirobako (both great anime about manga/anime industry)
>> ARTICLE
1) Gintama - hilarious, yet still manages to hit you with feels during the intense arcs 10/10

2) Hunter x Hunter (2011) - not even going to bother explaining this one, just watch it 10/10

3) Toradora - Best romance of any show out there imo 9.5/10

4) My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU - There is a reason you see so many posts on the front page of this sub that are about this show.  A lot of people feel like they relate to the main character, but what I enjoy most is the way the whole group learns to deal with their problems together and how they evolve throughout the show.  There were a few things preventing me from giving it higher than a 9.5/10 and I'll avoid mentioning them to avoid spoilers. Still a must watch.

5) Irregular at Magic High School - This is a very controversial choice, because many did not like the anime.  However, there were many who absolutely loved it and went on to read the light novels.  Everyone should give this show a shot, and if you enjoy it, move on to the light novels.  9/10

Must watch?

1. The iDOLM@STER - I don't know about you but I like cute anime girls, and this show has cute anime girls and *singing*. That's a pretty amazing deal. (Haruka is the best but don't worry Chihaya comes a close second)

2. Saki - You know what's only slightly worse than cute anime girls and singing? Cute anime girls and mahjong! Just with, y'know, superpowers. (seriously I learnt mahjong just to watch this show)

3. Girls und Panzer - And you know what's only slightly worse than cute anime girls playing mahjong? Cute anime girls and... tanks...? It's cute anime girls with undercurrents of military fetishisation, what's not to love? (they drift a tank in this show and that's always pretty cool) 

4. Yuru Yuri - You still want something that's only slightly worse than that? Well, here it is - cute anime girls and... nothing! You get to watch a whole show about cute anime girls sitting in a clubroom and talking with the occasional homoerotic undertones if that's your kinda thing. What a time to be alive. (not gonna lie I watched two seasons of this stuff don't judge me)

5. Love Live! - ...Yeah I got nothing.

>> ARTICLE
Here we go:

*  **Aria (all seasons)** -- Simply the best slice of life out there. A perfect example of how to flawlessly explore the characters and the world around them.  

* **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** -- Arguably one of the best and most well-liked Shounen/Adventure out there.  By no means 100% perfect, but there's good reason for its high standing. 

* **Redline** -- Seven years in the making, Redline showcases what the medium of animation can really do, and damn is it magnificent.  Not the most thought-provoking movie by a long shot, but its got a decent plotline and good characters that make it worth watching even despite its A++ animation. 

* **Puella Magi Madoka Magica** -- One of the most well-known and well-regarded series of the last few years, complete with a controversial third movie.  Has a well-written story and good characters.  

* **Spirited Away(?)** -- Probably any well-known and highly regarded Ghibli film could fit here (such as Mononoke Hime or Grave of the Firefiles, ect).  Get well-acquainted with the best film-makers in the industry.

* **BONUS: Kino's Journey** -- A shameless plug for my favorite anime.  A "Slice of Lives" if you will, Kino's Journey follows, well, Kino, as she ventures around meeting vastly different people during her short stay in each country.  Some are friendly, some aren't, and some have a strong attachment to something; whether it be tradition, scripture, or even their country itself.

I don't think so, to be honest. It's more like "Which shows do you think any anime watcher should watch", and that does not necessarily include a favorite.

The title is a bit misleading for me then. And op actually used his top5 favourites.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I did use them . I think they are a must watch. But a must watch doesn't necessarily mean favourite shows.

Oops, didn't see that. That could also mean OP thinks those are the 5 "must watch" anime though.

...well, I sure ain't gonna say that Strike Witches is a "must watch", so I'm sticking to my original understanding xD

1. Anohana, to show them that anime is not just perverted cartoons;
1. Shirobako, to show them that Anime is a legitimate business, that it also has its share of hardships and triumphs;
1. Ping-Pong/Tatami, to show that you don't need very sophisticated art to tell a good story;
1. Samurai Champloo, to show them that a good soundtrack can carry an anime;
1. No Game No Life, lastly, to show them that anime is made to sell its source material.

1. Code Geass
2. Puella Magi Madoka Magica
3. Death Note
4. The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya
5. Kara no Kyoukai Series

Seriously, if you've never seen any of these ten shows/movies and you call yourself an anime fan, do yourself a favor and give them a shot. I'm at the point where I compare every new show I watch to one of these in the hope that it will be at least half as enjoyable to watch. I'd also throw honorable mentions Hyouka, Oregairu, AnoHana, and Angel Beats! in there as well...I can never restrain myself when asked to give a list -__-

NGE, Hyouka, One piece or brotherhood, K-on!, Cowboy bebop

these arent all my favorites but there is a reason they are a must watch.

NGE well because it is NGE

K-on! because it was the "trigger" for this MOE anime age we have now

One piece or brotherhood as the special type of shounen that will probably be remembered forever and will always be landmarks on anime (much like NGE is)

Hyouka is there since its one of my favorites ever, mostly as a top 5 because of how everything is so good about it. Introspective MC, good cast, amazing animation, good OST, the misterys where fantastic... i could go on and on but i think it should be watched a lot

Cowboy bebop because its a amazingly well donne classic. There is a reason it became a classic. Everyone in the anime comunity knows about it and its highly regarded as a fantastic piece of the medium

stuff that didnt make the cut: Madoka magica, Kill la Kill which in my opinion better than TTGL (but TTGL is way more popular and there is no ecchi)

for a top 10  KlK for hype, Madoka magica for itself (i dont really know how to describe it) i think its gonna become one of those classics as time goes on, Shirobako which in my eyes is absolutely perfect, Ping Pong the animation for a beautifully donne story and amazing characters. And last but not the least White Album 2 since i dont have any romance besides hyouka here (but hyouka is more subtle) for realistic romance (even if some people dont like it, it feels very realistic

Now that i think about it there exist at least more than 50 shows that are a must watch, or for the amazing story they tell or because of popularity or some other things.

This looks pretty damn good. Previous creations of theirs looked a bit flimsy, but damn this one is great.

If your talking about the bleach sword, they made it flimsy so that it wouldn't weigh 80lbs like the buster sword

I guess so, was still kinda sad to see it bend etc :/
>> ARTICLE
Real swords are actually flexible by design. If they didn't bend, they'd break. I know the literal hunk-of-iron sword from Bleach may not be that way, but you also mentioned other previous works, which are quite intentionally flexible and not at all flimsy.

>> ARTICLE
Exactly what episode are you on? Not sure what you're comparing this to, but their animation style is fantastic, especially during action scenes. I don't understand what you mean by classic style of drawing reactions. Are you talking about the chibi moments? 

If you don't like the idea that most of the conflict in the story will revolve around the homunculi, then I guess it's not for you. Or maybe you just need to watch a little more. 

As for the "older Edward," you're not going to know more about that until more than halfway through the story.
>> ARTICLE
I'm at the 10th episode. 

Not sure what Chibi is but you know when someone calls the smaller brother Fullmetal and the actual Fullmetal goes all "IT'S ME, I'M NOT SMALL DON'T CALL ME PIPSQUEAK!" and his face loses all recognition and instead we get this white eyed face and arms that go up and down. It's just not in my taste.

Homonucli? What's that?


>> ARTICLE
That's exactly what chibi is: when the art style changes for comedic purposes. There's going to be a lot less of those moments as the story progress/shit gets serious.

Since you're only up to Episode 10, the homunculi in the story so far should be Lust, Gluttony, and Envy. IMO the villains and the world-building will only get better at this point, so I suggest giving it a few more tries before dropping.
>> ARTICLE
alright I'll try, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
The series will soon start to focus on a real plot and world building, and will take a serious tone soon after episode 10, dropping most of the comedic relief.

Up to you if you want to keep watching it or not.
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely worth watching to the end and it loses its comedy focus as time goes on. 
If you watch it all you will not be disappointed. 

>> ARTICLE
Watch the full show first. First 10 episodes are okay and have weak comedy, but after that you can't stop watching.
>> ARTICLE
That's where I'm at actually, 10 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
If you want to watch an amazing anime that everyone considers to be at least good to a masterpiece after they finished it, continue, if you don't feel like it, you could stop watching it and watch other shows.
>> ARTICLE
*A lot of people. The vast majority of /r/ anime worships it, but a lot of us don't feel the same. A masterpiece it is not. Entertaining, yeah, if it's your thing.
>> ARTICLE
Really, how can you improve it? The story writing is amazing and all of the characters are great. And I said that everyone considers to be at least good. Not everyone considers it the masterpiece it is. 
>> ARTICLE
The story writing is pretty good for shoenen, but it's nothing spectacular in my opinion. My biggest beef with it is the characters. The premise itself has a *lot* of promise, but the fact that the two main characters are the densest, most static MCs I've seen in a while (although again, shoenen) really hobbled the show in my eyes. Ditto for the villains.

I get that the Homunculus are meant to be the embodiment of the seven deadly sins, but they were all so... static, with the exception of Greed (in Brotherhood)/ Pride (2003). They represented their own trope, and had exactly *no* depth outside of it.

The supporting cast, in a lot of cases, were more interesting than the two main characters. I wish they'd elaborated on Hawkeye more in particular, as she was pretty interesting. To be frank, if Roy and Riza were the MCs, I'd have probably enjoyed the series a lot more. I've no love for the Elrics.

As for the masterpiece thing, I don't think any show that I can remember has ever hit that bar. The only thing anime that comes to mind would be the usual touted things like Ghibli films, and maybe the movies done by Madhouse directed by Mamoru Hosada, specifically Summer Wars and Wolf Children. I've never seen an episodic series come close, and I'm practically a *fervent zealot* in my love of things like Mushi-Shi and Ghost in the Shell. 

Anyway, that's just my feelings on it. You (and others) have your own opinion on it, and that's excellent, because anime is subjective. Just keep that in mind- because it's subjective, broad statements about acclaim are often out of place. And yeah, this applies to everything I've just said, so take it with a dose of salt. 

Sorry about the longwindedness!
>> ARTICLE
That was fun reading. Thanks for the output. Glad to see why someone doesn't think it is an amazing anime, and not just say overrated.
>> ARTICLE
> Watch the full show first.

This is a rediculous thing to expect of someone for a 26 episode series, let alone a 64 episode one. While I agree that the first 15 or so episodes of FMAB are subpar in comparison to the later parts (after the split with FMA03) it's unreasonable to demand someone sit through that much if they are not enjoying the experience. Just my 2 cents.
>> ARTICLE
I meant to say that if the show is praised so much, he should go in with no expectations and watch what it has to offer, and since it is praised he should at least watch the show to see if it is really that good.
>> ARTICLE
if you want better immersion, it might be better to watch the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime (the 2003 one) before Brotherhood. that one starts of better than Brotherhood did (which rushed to get to the parts not covered by the 2003 anime) and fleshed the characters out more imo, so it might be better to watch that first if you want world immersion.  
>> ARTICLE
If you aren't liking the tone you might find you prefer the 2003 fma, though it focuses even less on the world (later on fma:b spends a bit of the time world building). Fma 2003 as a whole in comparison to fmab tends to spend less time on the action and more time considering the impact of the events of the series on the characters. 

Fmab does become better but for me at least I found disappointing that fmab never feels as dark as the 2003 series though after sometime reading this sub reddit I realise this is a minority opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I have the same opinion as you actually. FMA:B I found uninteresting because it was all about fights. I just didn't care in the slightest about the characters or what they were doing, let alone why. The original was loads better.
>> ARTICLE
yes, the last 10-15 episodes was what made the anime for me.
>> ARTICLE
I felt exactly the same way as well. The comedy elements in particular were overused in the first 10 or so episodes and weren't funny at all. Whilst I can't promise you that they will go away they do tone down the dial a bit and the story really starts picking up.

I'd say watch the first 10-12 episodes. If you still can't stomach it then just leave it, but in the end I did think the show was great despite the lackluster start.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so basically the first 10-15 episodes are the first ~30 of the original series, so I'm guessing that instead of just repeating themselves they tried to make it "funny" by doing stupid reactions throughout that part of the story. It really annoyed me, too.
>> ARTICLE
All I can really say is that the story is fantastic. You do truly feel like there is more to the world and you actually learn more about it as they go on their adventures. There is little to no filler episodes and if there are it is because there's a purpose. The comedic effects that you comment on do in fact decrease to the point where the last two seasons are actually pretty serious. Most of the world building occurs in later seasons as the first season is mostly to introduce character and such. All I can say is to watch it. It's #1 for a reason. However if you are have no interest in the story or even the world setting and what's going on in the background then I don't think you'll be interested in it at all. All I have left to say is that it does have an amazing story, an amazing ending, and amazing character building. I've only watched about 50 anime and I've only rated 4 a 9/10 or above. This is one of them.
>> ARTICLE
watch 5 or 6 episode if u dont like it drop it. And no it does not get more serious.

Yes, it does.

I was told I didn't need to and there's nothing I don't understand. No references or such. I was even told the 2003 version wasn't that good.
>> ARTICLE
Whoever told you that is wrong. 2003 was considered one of the best anime ever made when it aired. It's just a separate story with the same characters but it's still recommended that you watch the 2003 version first if you plan on watching FMA
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay. It was from several sources by the way.
>> ARTICLE
Uhh, don't listen to that guy. If you don't want to waste time you can watch FMAB first. I watched FMAB first and I watched FMA after it. It is two different stories after a couple of episodes and can be watched either way.

Is there actually a reason to watch this?

The description made me think it'd just be another stock romance anime.

First 2 seasons are fantastic parody the third is my favorite deconstruction. Great series,  well with watching. I think season 1 is a little weaker,  but still with getting through to see the rest.

It's a harem, but not in the way you'd expect. It's mainly a comedy, but is very intelligent and handles both the serious and romantic parts very well.

A protagonist who is genre savvy as well as interesting in his own right. If you also read manga, I'd personally say it's better to read than to watch, though to be fair I only saw one season of the anime before switching.

In hindsight, maybe I should have.

Both sides of the spectrum were present: people were being rude while others were being supportive. I didn't want to "rile up" the thread any more than what was going on, and many people had said similar niceties to what I would have stated.

When people talk about Idolm@ster they often talk about that scene in ep. 20 but that's obvious. The one other scene I like just as much that isn't really mentioned very often was actually during the movie, where everyone's [](/s "chasing after Kana and when she starts breaking down Haruka moves closer to share her umbrella"). I think it just captures the surprising honesty at the core of Idolm@ster - it may be a big merchandise commercial about one-note character quirks, but it still wants to show you the creators put every effort into making everything as vibrant and nuanced as possible. 

What Haruka does there just feels like such a perfect representation of all of Idolm@ster's ambitions: she's the genki girl who [](/s "has to come to terms with her friend's tragic insecurities") but still stays true to trying to support each other through her small but honest acts of friendship and empathy. 

It's as if the creators are Haruka and Idolm@ster is the friend - they're genuinely passionate about their work, and although an idol show isn't the most ambitious project they could be working on they still pour their emotions into it because they love what they do. 

Not to say the scene isn't carried by its own emotional weight - I still get teary every time I see it - but it's an extra minor thing that makes me appreciate it all the more.  

It sounds pretty sappy, I know. But that's how I see it.

Honestly, his only mistake was having thin skin when it came to criticism. For quite a while he's had all of his posts get downvoted continuously regardless of whether or not they were good discussion comments or not.

He usually brought an interesting point of view to discussions and when watching shows (eg. his Steins;Gate thread from way back).

Yeah he was a little immature, yeah he was a little over the top on his snark sometimes but he wasn't as bad as people seem to think he was/is.
>> ARTICLE
But even when point comes to shove, He had thicker skin towards criticism than most people that visit this sub, being able to take the ones who criticized him for so long.  
It's sad to see him leave, as he always started good discussions, which were miraculously always downvoted to hell.  
The biggest problem with this sub is that well, people can't take that people dislike their favourite shows, or people can't take it when someone rips a show a new one because people just don't seem to notice the glaring flaws.

He was easy to talk with too, and if you just asked him for an explaination about why he didn't like certain things about a show, he'd explain it to you.  
Let's learn from him and don't take people for granted, because if it keeps going the way it is, no-one will even be allowed to dislike shows anymore, and that's not what we're going for right?

I've been a lurker here for months and months, and across has always been an inspiration to me, he was just so different from everyone else. and he always had a different opinion to give. I have a whole new layer of respect for him after hereing about Seele.

> I have a whole new layer of respect for him after hereing about Seele.

It always surprises me when people over here are aware of it. Since we were keeping it completely under wraps until that weird cosplay post related misundestanding - and most people in this sub don't go to /r/metaanime. But yeah, he was the one who brought a lot of the frequent posters together to discuss how the sub could be improved.

I sent your comment(s) to him, he appreciates it.

Actually, can you describe exactly what Seele was and where he fit into it? There's still a lot that's been left unsaid.

We were basically just brainstorming and debating things that we thought were wrong with the subreddit, or not perfect or could be made better.

Lots of ideas were thrown about, thrown away, adapted etc.

Was good fun regardless of whether it was necessary in the end or not.

(Was funny seeing MissyPie start adding things to the subreddit which were discussed earlier in /r/seele - had to delete quite a few things off the list since they were fixed along the way without us needing to mention them :P)

There was a huge emphasis on bringing it up with the mods in a way that wouldn't come across as aggressive, since it was just for improvement (he wanted it to be more aggressive originally but everyone convinced him that was a bad idea).

He basically just started it, got a lot of people to join and then we all (him included) came up with stuff and discussed stuff. Nothing sinister.

So Across just started it? Did he participate in it? How big was it?
>> ARTICLE
He started and participated it. Wasn't the leader of it though, everyone was on the same level really. Couple of people were more active than others etc but that's about it.

How big was the list or how big was the sub?

Not quite sure, there were maybe 6-8 of us discussing stuff frequently with 2-3 around every now and then.

List was around 22 points long, colour coded with stuff that had been fixed, debated, agreed upon, void, wasn't worth the time, too much trouble for the mods, etc.

If across comments start derailing every thread over the next few days I'll probably join him.

I'm right there with you. This is such stupid drama :P

Sorry for ignorance, but what has happened?

Someone made a thread about what users you like/dislike and why.  A lot of people took that opportunity to talk bad about him and he made a thread saying he was leaving /r/anime Both threads were deleted because they aren't anime related.

>  A lot of people took that opportunity to talk bad about him 

Only 3 people did. He got pissed off because of the downvotes.
