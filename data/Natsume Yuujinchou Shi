A really good series. Really couldn't stop watching it, made me very sad when I no longer had anymore episodes to watch... 
>> ARTICLE
That's why I've spread each season out so far.  The thought of no more Natsume overrides the need to keep watching, at least for me.
>> ARTICLE
I can't do that :( I'm obsessive. 
>> ARTICLE
You should pick up the manga! 
>> ARTICLE
Dammit, I was planning on writing a WT for Natsume.  
>> ARTICLE
I think this is the second one. You can always write a third :P

Here's a [link to the first one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2vayoz/wt_natsume_yuujinchou_an_amazingly_sweet_and/)
>> ARTICLE
I don't think WT have to be one-and-done though, really. Obviously a flood of them for one show is bad but having two or three to a show, especially one like Natsume, is not a bad thing.
>> ARTICLE
You should write one too! Seriously, more publicity would be amazing. I would love Natsume's face all over this subreddit. 
>> ARTICLE
This anime. This. So much. I remember watching the first season every week for a new episode. Then I didnt follow season 2 and 3. Especially season 3. Every episode was a punch in the feels. The more you watch the more Natsume has a grip on you. Till the end of s3 it still seems that we have much more to know about him.  

Especially the episode of the forgotten god where he diminishes in size over time. It just... Gets to me you know?   

It is also one of the animes that I dont skip the OP and ED. The other animes I listen the OP/ED to are Sakamichi no Apollon, and Cowboy Bebop.

>> ARTICLE
When I first saw this show recommended and someone said it was like Mushishi, I gave it a shot. The first two episodes didn't kill me, I believe it was on the third episode (might be another episode) but yea the forgotten god episode, was in which I finally said wow this is good. That episode was just so damn well written and made. I've put the show currently on hold due to having a bunch of shows that i'm currently watching and haven't finished Mushishi (1 slow relaxing show at a time is perfectly enough). But definitely going to watch it! 

P.S: Already bought the figure based on that one episode and an impulsive moment haha.
>> ARTICLE
Haha! Great to know! What figure did you buy?

>> ARTICLE
Twas this one: http://myfigurecollection.net/item/198656


>> ARTICLE
Fuck, this is the first time I'm genuinely interested in a figurine. Shit.. How much did this cost you?
>> ARTICLE
Around 80 something ish with shipping, I think now its sold out in major stores so price went up a bit, but wait it out a little (follow the comments on it/ebay) etc... you'll probably find a used one for less than what i payed and still in really good condition! I haven't removed him from his box yet since I'm not sure how much I enjoy this show yet + don't have the room atm. so I can't tell u how nice he is etc... plus I don't want to get you into such an expensive hobby xD. But in all honesty i love collecting figures brings characters alive for me... and supports the industry! 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's kinda pricey.. but man my heart fluttered when I saw natsume and madara! Ah..
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean, I love figures but damn the nice ones are always pricey sigh... guess the broke life is the life for me.
>> ARTICLE
> It just... Gets to me you know?

Exactly this. The whole series.
>> ARTICLE
Especially the ending song. It makes every episode seem like there's an intangible longing for something. I can't put my finger on it, but the whole show dances with the spectrum of the human emotion. 
>> ARTICLE
Natsume Yuujichou - For those who found Mushishi too serious and Monogatari too harem/ecchi

Still a really good show, definitely worth watching for fans of SoLs


>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite series.  There is actually a WT! for it already if you check out the way back machine (aka search bar) but yours is better, anyway.I think the general feeling of the series that you're referring to could best be described as "bittersweet."  Often, over the course of an episode, Natsume is forced to revisit sad memories from his past in the process of helping his friends, both human and youkai.  His struggle to let people in without pushing them away, or to protect them by not letting them close is handled very succinctly, and feels true-to-life, despite his fantastic situation.With regard to your "bad stuff," I think *Natsume,* despite being episodic, does an admirable job of mixing up its formula.  There's no set pattern on which the series relies too heavily, which keeps each episode feeling like a fresh experience.Favorite episode: *Natsume Yuujinchou San* Episode 4, "Young Days"
>> ARTICLE
Nyanko-sensei is best Tsundere. 

In all seriousness, the first episodes bored me to death since I was a bit underwhelmed. As I got used to it, however, I was able to fully appreciate how simple and beautiful Natsume Yuujinchou was. 

It's one of those anime that is almost like a comfort zone. Nothing mindblowing, nothing superincredible, nothing crazy. But when it's over, you feel much better for it. 

They almost feel like shows I would see on PBS way back in the day, personally..
>> ARTICLE
Nyanko-sensei is awesome.  I have a large Nyanko plushie :D
>> ARTICLE
Sounds awesome! I'd like a beanbag-chair sized Nyanko if possible
>> ARTICLE
Nyanko-sensei totally is. And yeah it definitely sneaks up on you. You relax and enjoy all these characters and their stories and all of a sudden its over. It was then for me that I realized just how much I'd fallen in love with all the characters.
>> ARTICLE
The show is available on crunchyroll, and because I agree with OP that you should go watch it here are some guest passes.

Everyone should try Natsume Yuujinchou, it's really good.

As far as you not noticing my WT! - I don't mind, yours is more indepth and better written anyway.
>> ARTICLE
If there are people who have dropped along the way, be warned: the series does get better with each season. At least that's what I think (and most people who've watched it think). 
Then again, if you didn't like it enough in the first season, I doubt you'd like it in the second season onwards because the thematic approach is pretty much the same. 
>> ARTICLE
Am watching the fourth season right now and am already devasted to know that I've only got 6 more episodes to go. I would put Natsume Yuujinchou a bit below Mushishi and Kino no Tabi since fans of one of those series almost always enjoy the other two, but I still like it a lot and can't get enough of it. The entire cast is likeable - of course Takashi and especially Madara take the cake, but I can't say I dislike any other character in here - or episode, for that matter. Can only highly recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
The last episode of S4 is just absolutely heartbreaking.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished episode 8 of S4. Episode 4 of Shi's my favorite so far (the one with the Youkai that could imitate voices), but I'm excited to see what it still has in store for me.
>> ARTICLE
When I was reading the manga (before S3 or 4 aired) I specifically remember thinking that the chapter that episode is based on would be a great way to end the series. And then they did it. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes! This anime is great, I almost finished It I just can't bear to watch the last episode, because it will be over :'(
>> ARTICLE
> In much the same manner as Mushishi I think it's basically impossible to binge watch

People always say this. Don't get it 'cause it certainly isn't impossible. I *always* binge watch both Natsume Yuujinchou and Mushishi!
>> ARTICLE
Haha then you're definitely a different kind person than I am, which is pretty cool. In the future this just means I'll have to be careful not to make such blanket statements.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a very "gotta do everything in one go" type of person. I even do the same thing with incredibly long series (like One Piece) and video games.
>> ARTICLE
I binge watched Mushishi too. Re Natsume, its on hold for me. Mostly because Madara is just silly.
>> ARTICLE
I watched this on your recommendation! Wow.. it's so good. I didn't get into Mushishi so this was a surprise for me. Natsume Yuujinchou was more likable because it has a bit more comedy thanks to Madara.

Hotarubi no mori e (by the same mangaka) is also just as beautiful. Thank you x
>> ARTICLE
That's awesome! Im glad you enjoyed it. Its my favorite for a reason :D

I was considering putting this on my PtW but the shoujo put me off a bit. I did now and will probably watch it before the spring season starts.

Off topic, we have a ridiculously high compatibility rate:

> I was considering putting this on my PtW but the shoujo put me off a bit. Aside from most of the male characters being semi-bishounen, it really doesn't adhere to any of the usual tropes found in the shoujo demographic.  The source material is published in a magazine targeted at girls.  That's why it gets the tag.
>> ARTICLE
> but Ive never seen one on Natsume Yuujinchou.

Ehh, before making statements, please, [use search bar](http://redd.it/2vayoz).
>> ARTICLE
I hadn't seen that, but neither did I look, dang. I'll link to it in the post above.
>> ARTICLE
That would be great, thanks. 

Dear writers, please, check up if there already was a [WT!] thread for the anime you're going to write about. Several [WT!] threads for one anime do speak for the anime's popularity, but I'm not sure if writing about the same thing is a great idea anyway.

Disregarding that, I liked your post very much, good work and crisp writing, see you in a compilation [WT!] thread.
>> ARTICLE
Is is a full story? Does it have a resolution?
>> ARTICLE
It does as far as the tv series is concerned I think (I haven't read the manga), and its absolutely worth watching. I believe there is an ova that came out following the final season but I haven't watched that and so I can't comment on it but the series itself does have a resolution as far as I'm concerned.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, thanks! I've been meaning to get on this for a while.
>> ARTICLE
Natsume Yuujinchou's story isn't really what progresses more than what grows. It's not something that is extremely obvious but it's not very subtle either.  
  
Natsume's story progresses in a way that 'flows', instead of "we achieved X in ep Y, now the story goes Z" you get a story progression along that is less appearant.  
  
It's difficult to explain, but the story is essentially a story of growth.
>> ARTICLE
Feel like I should add my two cents. IIRC the ending of the anime is certainly satisfying, but it is not the complete story. The manga is still ongoing and as such the anime doesn't reach what I imagine would be considered the logical ending point of the story. However, considering the type of story Natsume is, that shouldn't feel uber important anyway.
>> ARTICLE
The OVA episode is quite good, but it's basically an extra episode of the anime.  It could have aired in the middle of *Shi* without seeming out of place.  Same goes for the Nyanko-Sensei special, though that one was a bit more comedy-focused.  They're simply "more of the same," which in this case, isn't a bad thing at all.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
I've watched the first three seasons already and what bothers me is that the MC keeps saying how weak he is and how he needs to protect people, but never does anything about it. I keep hoping that he improves himself by learning the arts of dealing with the creatures. I guess the main part of the series is the character development of him learning to trust people and whatnot due to his childhood, which is good, but still... Maybe I'm just too used to shows targeted for males.
>> ARTICLE
The way he "protects people" is by keeping them at arm's length.  That way they aren't (at best) forced to believe something they can't see, or (at worst) dragged into the world of youkai - either physically or through worry for Natsume.  It's the slow lessening of the emotional distance Natsume has with those around him that is the ongoing focus of the series.  He starts to allow others to get close to him, which was impossible for him in the past.  It's a subtle growth, unlike the typical battle-shounen MC, and *Natsume Yuujinchou* (especially in later seasons) portrays it very well.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm... well its certainly different than what I experienced. [Spoiler maybe...](/s "The romance thing is something I go back and forth about. I don't think it would've been a bad addition to the show but neither do I think it's necessary. I don't think it would've really furthered their point by including romance, but I certainly see the angle.") I don't know if thats a spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I am a guy and I can relate to Natsume Takashi. Not every guy is interested in having a romantic relationship with every girl he meets. 
>> ARTICLE
Especially someone with Natsume's trust problems. He's just getting used to having friends I think romance is a little far off for him.
>> ARTICLE
Erm... I'm a guy and I found him extremely relatable. So I suppose you can think whatever you want about me based on that haha.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I mean sure he is somewhat feminine but he is still a properly written male.
>> ARTICLE
I completely disagree.  First off, not everyone subscribes to an "alpha male" ideal.  I certainly don't.  Natsume is a unique character, neither dense nor aggressive.  He just has other priorities.  Keep in mind that Natsume didn't have a "normal" upbringing or form any lasting friendships / attachments until high school.  Now rethink if he behaves normally.And one of Natsume's normal friends does, in fact, show interest in female characters.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)
>> ARTICLE
How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

Well deserved.

Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites. 

Miyamori is love, Miyamori is life.

I'd love to see this updated after every season. Maybe this can be a sidebar addition or something.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

Surprised I've never heard of rainbow considering its so high up this list.

In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

Holy shit.

You should, it's pretty great.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.

I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.

Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.

I really like this show--I know a lot of other people weren't impressed, but I loved the character development, story, and animation style.

A great way to start the season. Reminded me why I watched the other seasons. It's almost like seeing old friends again!

Once again, I laugh heartily whenever Nyanko-sensei does something onscreen.  His voice actor is just perfect.  

Also, I seem to remember an article posted here a little bit ago about Natsume being released on DVD or Blu-Ray here in America in the future.  If that's true...

I'm not sure if I like the whole Matoba arc thing. Although it's good that the show is starting to take more form as a story, I honestly enjoyed the separate youkai encounters more. Either way though, I liked the new episode of the season. Cliffhanger ending! How rare is that? Also I loved the opening animation...Natsume's too precious.

No problems with updates. This information is valuable and these threads should start to get more upvotes eventually to increase awareness.

heh, I didn't mean anything by it. It's always amusing to see how much more popular inuboku is in Japan that it is on /r/anime
>> ARTICLE
considering the only show on this list that I watched was Another it pains me to see it so low considering how much I enjoyed the series.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, I'm okay with this, though I'd like to see Papakiki a bit higher. DxD was a good show, and I'd like to see a second season.
>> ARTICLE
So many people just shouting fanservice this and fanservice that. Zero no Tsukaima is second to last and Natsume is near the top. 

Maybe find an argument that actually corresponds with the data.

With regards to Nichibros. Gintama is extremely popular, but there's a ton of series that have the same comedy style, like Nichibros. We only get a small portion of those, but Japan is practically drowning in it. It also committed the grievous sin of not taking advantage of the animation, anime is a visual medium and Nichibros just kinda ignored that. The actual manga might sell really well considering how much cheaper manga is. Nichibros getting over 3k sales is actually pretty damn good. 

"Another" I wasn't expecting to have good sales either because its re-watch value is actually quite low. After you finish watching the show, it loses a lot of the mystery that made it good. The merchandise might sell well, but for the ~$400 it costs I doubt people would want a physical copy. 

Chihayafuru I already know isn't going to do well because 1. It's a Josei so it's sales will be lower regardless and 2. They fucked up and gave it a broadcast time at around 2a.m. when it should have had one mid-day to appeal to a larger audience. 


>> ARTICLE
> We only get a small portion of those, but Japan is practically drowning in it.

Are there that many anime series that we never get to see?
>> ARTICLE
It's not just anime it's stand-up comedians, talk shows, Manga, live-action and other mediums. It's like the tons of Familyguy/simpsons type shows that are all over America. Eventually people just get fed up with seeing more of the same type of humor.
>> ARTICLE
You dont need plot in HD. you do need boobies and shit in HD. thus people buy fanservice-y dvd/blu-ray. A good plot stays in your head for a long ass time. Good porn will last maybe 20 minutes.
>> ARTICLE
Watching anime in HD is really thrilling to me. It's like a level of smoothness I've never seen before. I watched Code Geass in 1080, and it was one of the most beautiful things I had seen up to that point.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, i forget how great anime looks downloaded compared to streaming sometimes. especially with the downloaded anime is in 720 or 1080.
>> ARTICLE
People will watch porn pixelated blocky and distorted so I seriously doubt that. 

Besides, no one will ever forget toothbrush, but that won't stop people from re-watching the hell out of it.
>> ARTICLE
Hah Kill Me Baby at 15 is no surprise but for what it was, I liked it and I loved Yasuna and Agiri, the stoner ninja.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't expecting to see Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou sell past 2,000 at this stage, I am a bit surprised.
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know, I'm the only one that really really liked Kill Me Baby. Everyone I ask says they dropped it within 2 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad to see Inu x Boku and Ano Natsu did well, a shame about Another though. 


>> ARTICLE
Meh. Look at any media for the past... decades. Hollywood movies, pop music, etc. Most of everything is pandering crap, but there will always be some high idealed creator that wants to make something actually good.

Go, Natsume Yuujinchou Shi, go! :)
>> ARTICLE
I don't get it. Inu x Boku SS was not good. In fact I think it was one of the weakest shows of the season, together with Brave 10.

 It's really sad to see Rinne so low even below Brave 10 (Yuck). Oh well the second season has already been announced. so that's at least something. Symphogear was pretty awesome though even with some QUALITY and engrish issues.

Japs have terrible taste.
>> ARTICLE
> Inu x Boku SS was not good. 

Sure, it was not very good. But there were no very good series that season. If you except InuBoku, Rinne, and Mouretsu, I didn't manage to get past episode 2 of any series.
>> ARTICLE
those that buy DVD/BluRays love that moe.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, DVD/BRDs are so overpriced in Japan that only a small number of otaku buy them. The business model for anime over there is very different and was covered in a series of posts on (I think) ANN. It's reasonable to conclude that the people who buy the discs aren't an unbiased representation of the overall broadcast anime viewer community.
>> ARTICLE
Inu x Boku and Natsume Yuujinchou.. Fujoshi staying strong I see.
I liked Inu x Boku though. 

I would also like to say that for ecchi standards I heard that Highschool DxD wasn't that bad, plus uncensored tits. It's really no surprise that ecchi animes sell high. Why do you think there are so many of them each season? Because everyone's trying to make an easy buck.

Everything else you mentioned I dropped, except for Inu x Boku which was lovely.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I honestly enjoyed DxD quite a bit, and not just for the fanservice. I'm glad it did well, it's definitely one I would buy, since the animation is very smooth and eye-catching (and I repeat, not just for the tits...*but seriously*).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I started DxD for the fanservice, stayed for the fun plot line and the great sense of humor it had.

Um...i thought in include shows that focused in comedy since they are relaxing, but i'll decided against it and kept it mostly about shows with good backgrounds and/or calm themes.

Late to the party but i couldnt ignore that the best show was missing

Spice and Wolf

Medieval roadtrip with a merchant and a wolf goddess. Chill athmosphere, great dialogs, amazing character synergy.
>> ARTICLE
For real I can't believe this one is not in the top comments.
Best medieval, romance and relaxing(aside from Mushishi) anime I've seen.

Aria and Tamayura

I just recently started watching Cross Game, it's so chill and enjoyable to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Usagi Drop I guess
>> ARTICLE
I honestly don't know either of those you suggested, but of the ones I've watched I'd call Usagi Drop pretty relaxing. Hanasaku Iroha was relaxing to me, but I suppose there's enough human conflict in that to not be quite "soothing", though I still recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
Actually just started watching Hanasaku Iroha a few minutes ago. Thanks for your suggestion. 
>> ARTICLE
It's easily in my top three shows that I can't really decide between as a "favorite." Hope you enjoy it!

wow I'm shocked no one mentioned 

=Samurai Champloo..even the ending song is relaxing.

Well, it will at least be including the total score number. And those at least seem to be following the rank number so far...

The Bangumi rank is also slightly based on popularity.

Ah, okay.

Gundam War in the Pocket:

This list isn't filled with hyped up shows like MAL is, interesting.

EDIT: I noticed the smaller number of people who rated these anime, which may attribute to the difference between it and MAL

Yes, OPM isn't in this freaking list

\#1 is Cowboy Bebop, I'm impressed
>> ARTICLE
They seem to like Mecha and Sci-Fi/Space more. Interesting.
>> ARTICLE
What's kind of interesting is that compared against MAL, you'd need to skew these scores up by 0.15 to 0.25.  I'm curious about their overall average score, and the number of anime on their list.

Some changes are nice, like not having FMA:B as an absurd 9.25.  But then again, Gintama is still up there, so wamp wamp.

For the currently airing anime i am watching atm:

Beelzebub: B

Guilty Crown: C+
Kill Me Baby: B-, A+ for the ED
Naruto Shippuden: C- for current arc, C- as a Whole
Papa no Iukoto: uhh idk, b- maybe
Phi Brain: One of the few shows I enjoy but alot of others despise. B-
Poyo: Round Cat

I watched Zero no Tsukaima seasons 1 and 2 happily. Loved it (except sometimes Louise was too much tsun and not enough dere...)

Remember the last episode or two of season 2? Louise and Saito are going great, everything is at it's peak. Awesome.
Que season 3. What's that? Ignore that and go set their relationship back to where it was by the second episode of season 1? ALRIGHT. 

I got fed up and dropped it halfway through season 3. I might have to push through it to get to the fourth season.

I didn't know it was from David Production. That changes its priority in my backlog.
>> ARTICLE
A little bit surprised that DxD is doing that well. The show was funny, I'll give it that, but other than that and the fanservice (which was done pretty well) it wasn't that notable.
>> ARTICLE
I'm more surprised about the moe pirate show.
>> ARTICLE
It's actually not that mo at all, it's more of a throwback to 90s Space Operas. With lots of technology porn and sci-fi technobabble.
>> ARTICLE
>not that mo at all

Then you have a very different opinion about what's [moe](http://i.imgur.com/0m4lV.jpg) and what's not.  The Female:Male ratio alone speaks a lot about how the show works and the audience it was targeted to. I'm simply not part of that audience.
>> ARTICLE
The Female:Male ratio actually becomes much more balanced as the show goes on. [Once they're on the ship it's pretty much even](http://i.imgur.com/vYskA.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
I'll give it a fair shot. 3 - 5 episodes. 

Who knows, I may be wrong.
>> ARTICLE
That's like saying Madoka Magica is a moe show because the cast is mostly teenaged girls. I'm not going to force you to watch Mouretsu Pirates, but I think you're dismissing it without really giving it a fair shot.
>> ARTICLE
the characters for Madoka Magica are 110% moe.  We're talking, maximum moe factor.  The excessive moe was probably intentional in order to invoke a protective response from the audience during some of the more dramatic scenes of the show to accent them and make them more dramatic.
>> ARTICLE
Well, to be fair, Madoka (specifically, Mami) won the [Saimoe 2011](http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Saimoe), so it is *kind of* moe. I was actually hoping Mouretsu was going to be K-ON! in space (but better); pleasantly surprised at all the sci-fi and plot, especially since they have 26 episodes to work with.
>> ARTICLE
You are saying that all wisdom involving humanity can't be summed up in *boobs*? Psssss... you know nothing! **NOTHING.**
>> ARTICLE
I usually think of boobs as a multiplier. If a show is good, boobs tend to make it even better. If a show isn't so great, it's possible that boobs won't make it fantastic.

On a somewhat related note, I hope DxD gets a sequel, since apparently it gets more romancey in later volumes of the manga, and, y'know, boobs and romance
>> ARTICLE
Theres, fanservice/lots of action/comedy/pretty graphics/mystery/plot twists/etc.

I would almost go as far as to say 90% any show is solely for entertainment value. fanservice is just an acceptable target atm, getting the author's message across is all the story needs to do.

TTGL did it's job right getting across a message of positive thinking and motivation, that's what makes it a great work. A show could spout out all the philosophy it wants, if nobody watches it then it doesn't mean a thing.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting theory you've got going on here... You might be my new best friend.  
On the side note, haven't read the manga but... Highschool DxD is the only show that I've dropped for being annoyed by a character, and yet came back and finished it, ending up being pleasently surprised. At least it *tried* to be a decent show with the obvious ecchi factors, not so much like others...  
Boobs indeed make it more appealing, but I must not leave behind the: "*Are Aree..*" from the lighting priest. I'm a sucker for those things.

Sakamichi no Apollon slowrolls its status as "the only 2012 anime with a prayer of appealing to anyone outside of anime fans". Hyouka does respectably, but its numbers, along with all recent KyoAni shows, pale in comparison to LoliButts Operation. SAO proves adolescent power fantasies are a dream that cross oceans, with equal success in Japan and abroad. Shinsekai Yori continues to be outsold by damp paper towels. The industry marches on.
>> ARTICLE
> pale in comparison to LoliButts Operation. 

Not to mention, the bestseller is a video about dental hygiene.

It's kind of depressing but to be expected. Still, I'm pretty disappointed that shinsekai Yori can't even break 1k and girls und panzer and SAO sell with flying color.

**,594 02/09 Shin sekai yori

O_O oh lord
>> ARTICLE
It's considered hugely successful if over 10,000 copies are sold....
just saying.

I'm surprised that Kuroko no Basuke is only that high despite the insane popularity in doujinshi community and elsewhere.
>> ARTICLE
Do you know why these number are relatively low compared to other video sales? 10.000 copies can't be far more than 300.000$, which doesnt seem much for a whole animation company, or am I missing something major?
>> ARTICLE
A season of anime doesn't cost $30, it's closer to $300.
>> ARTICLE
Although I'm not so sure about how much they make, well, let me just say that anime industry is actually pretty hungry business, where people work endlessly in a pretty bad condition.
>> ARTICLE
Each volume (of which there are 6 per series) is $60 each, so $320 per series sold.  There's also DVDs and sales made later down the road.  Then there's merchandise like figurines sold for hundreds of dollars (not sure what royalties/margins the studios get), OSTs, posters/wallscrolls, plushies etc. I assume that since they pay to air their series (versus being paid in western TV companies) they might also get paid for their shows viewership by advertisers/the TV network for advertising.

They don't make crazy amounts of money per series, that's why the animation quality is so low in the first place. The animators in Japan are paid pretty poorly and a lot of the work is passed out to Koreans and others to keep the costs as low as possible. Animation quality also doesn't really seem to affect sales so there's not much point investing in something which doesn't seem them any returns.
>> ARTICLE
Seeing Shin sekai yori at the bottom, while seeing shows like Busou Shinki or Oniichan dakedo getting four-five times the number of sales, really makes me lose hope in the industry. I was hopping SSY would launch a trend for anime based on actual novels but no, apparently telling a story isn't as successful as pandering.

Not that there's anything wrong with LN or VN, but the keep adapting the strangest titles..
>> ARTICLE
SSY really is glorious. If anyone hasn't looked into it yet then go try it now. It just doesn't have the mass appeal or otaku pandering to be a success. It's a niche interest within a niche interest. Disappointing because the anime medium has so much potential for bringing good stories to life with the right art and music and SSY is a great example of it.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone tell me what these numbers are?
>> ARTICLE
These numbers are combined BD/DVD sales in Japan for each of the series in total.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so some shows actually sell less than 400 copies?
>> ARTICLE
Ginga e Kickoff is a kids show. Who buys kids shows on DVD? NTR is something I'm quite surprised about. I haven't seen it, but it looked like the kind of show that would sell at least 2k.
>> ARTICLE
If a show is not well received, then yeah it can sell very little.  With the amount of money put into each show, studios can afford few failures.  I suspect (don't quote me on this, merely a thought) it's why studios create shows which pander to the Japanese otaku with shows featuring moe, fanservice, etc.  Those shows will be much more likely to succeed.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah G&P crush the competition under your glorious iron threads.

[xxxHOLiC](http://myanimelist.net/anime/861/xxxHOLiC) - same idea of having a business that deals with the supernatural, my personal favourite for this genre though I did enjoy Mushi-Shi, Mononoke and Natsume too

might want to try [Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror](http://myanimelist.net/anime/586/Ayakashi:_Japanese_Classic_Horror) aswell (Mononoke is a spinoff from one of the tales)
>> ARTICLE
While I liked xxxHOLIC, I really don't see it and Natsume as being very much alike. Frankly, I'd be more willing to say that if you liked Natsume, you'd probably like something like Usagi Drop, which has nothing to do with the supernatural. Both shows, however, have the same gentle character-centric focus that to me transcends the story and setting.
>> ARTICLE
Great I will look into them!

yes, the exact feeling i had!
EDIT: Hotarubi and Natsume had the same production company and some recurring voice actors (i think), if you havent noticed ( but probably have )

Can someone explain what the numbers are in relation to current vol./total vol.?

So for SAO, would this be an accurate reading of the data: the 39,745 sales are the average sales over the only three volumes currently out (6 have yet to be released).

EDIT: Oh what is the time scale of these sales? Per week/month/total sales?
>> ARTICLE
The numbers are the average of the Volume sales. So yes 39,745 is the average for the 3 volumes of SAO out right now and not the combined number. When another volume of SAO comes out it will then be averaged into the numbers.

Expect any of the averages for incomplete series to go down when they are completed as First volume sales are almost always highest.

Edit: These are the sales totals. After volumes stop ranking on Oricon they are considered the total for that volume since the numbers drop to such an insignificant degree like >100units/week
>> ARTICLE
So it would be fair to say that SAO has sold about 120,000 units (~40,000 * 3). Which would mean it would have 120,000 * ~$50 = $6,000,000 roughly in sales of those first three volumes? That's pretty baller if so.

Last question. How do volumes rank on Oricon then?
>> ARTICLE
Oricon collects data from tens of thousands of retailers and releases the sales data for the top 50 Bluray and top 50 DVD in sales for each week. Recently they changed it to include the top 100 of each. 

Anything over 500 sales will usually show up on the list and even more will now that it is 100, so the sales data is fairly accurate
>> ARTICLE
SAO volumes are 66 USD on amazon.co.jp, so it'd be 7.9mil. That's also discounted from the RRP of 90 USD so it'd likely be more when factoring in smaller discounts from other retailers.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it yet myself, but I know [Cowboy Bebop]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop) is episodic.

Also, [Monster]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster) isn't always episodic, but it's very slow. When I say it isn't "always episodic," I mean sometimes there's an arc that goes by in three or four episodes and sometimes there's just a single standalone episode, if that makes sense. 
>> ARTICLE
+1 for monster, not sure it's what you're looking for but it's amazing (and underrated)
>> ARTICLE
A recent slow-paced and episodic anime that I think is pretty good is One-Week Friends, but I don't know if you're into slice of life and kind of romance anime.

For some other suggestions, I'd advice the Monogatari series, starting with Bakemonogatari. It's not exactly episodic, but there's five different story arcs, each spanning a few episodes, and the different arcs aren't super important to each other. In that way it kind of feels episodic. There's also no big "goal" in the series, so it gives adequate time to cover the topics that are presented without rushing through things to get to the "point" of the show. It also does have supernatural elements, but the main focus is on the relationships and dialogue between the characters.

I would also suggest Serial Experiments Lain.... Maybe. I wouldn't exactly call it episodic, but it doesn't exactly feel like each episode is a direct continuation of the last, even though I think it technically is. Lain is... an experience. It's really difficult for me to explain, but I thought it was amazing, and would suggest at least looking into it and seeing if you might be interested.

And you've probably either already watched or heard that you should watch Evangelion, but if not, you should watch Evangelion. It follows an episodic monster-of-the-week formula for a good chunk of the show, and definitely takes it's sweet time with pacing at certain parts, albeit likely because the budget got pretty tight. Anyways, I hope some of these suggestions were helpful for you, and have fun.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your suggestions! I've already started watching One-Week Friends, exactly what I need atm.
Also, I didn't know Bakemonogatari was only the first part of a series, so I'll watch the rest of that as well. Heck, I'll probably watch all of your suggestions, as I've also heard a lot of good things about Serial Experiments Lain a looong time ago. Sometimes I totally forget about certain series I've put on my to-watch list. So it's nice to be reminded.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I hear you, I've got a huge backlog of anime that were suggested to me. And yup, Bakemonogatari is just the first season in a series of 3 seasons and an ova (with another ova and a movie on the way.) It's definitely on of favorite list.
>> ARTICLE
> Bakemonogatari ... no big goals

Yeah nothing until Monogatari S2 really. Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari are really just character introductions.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's a pretty good way to look at it, I never thought of that before. Yeah Monogatari S2 seemed to be more plot driven rather than character development driven, especially in the last arc with Kaiki.
>> ARTICLE
Given those three, Aria seems like it would fit your tastes perfectly. Three seasons of pure, atmospheric bliss.

YKK (Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou) is also a good choice if you want a shorter but still solid SoL.
>> ARTICLE
Aria sounds promising! thanks, definitely gonna watch it!
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, totally forgot about that series! I started watching it a couple of years ago, but I had a lot of other things on my mind so I never really got into it and stalled at the second episode or so. It fits the bill so I'll definitely give it another chance!
>> ARTICLE
Hell Girl is an episodic, 3 season anime about a website where people can call hell girl to ferry away their tormentor to hell, but in exchange, when they die they must also go to hell. It gets repetitive but if you're looking for episodic, it's episodic to the max.
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop are both quite episodic. I think Hell Girl might be episodic as well, though tbh i've only watched one episode so far, it seems like it's going to go that way.

Excel Saga is also quite episodic up until the last few episodes.

I use pace to describe how fast the general story progresses, since episodic anime don't really have a general story, i'm not really sure what you mean by slow paced? do you kinda mean not much action?  (in which case ignore my suggestions... xD)

Yay!

Is this supposed to be nekomonogatari (kuro)?

Nisemonogatari came out in 2012. Nekomonogatari came out on Dec 31, 2012 (all 4 episodes) so I'm not sure if it counts towards this.

I'm glad Natsume did well. Hopefully it'll make a new season more likely. 
>> ARTICLE
No plans yet. Each season covers 3 volumes of the manga. Currently there is 1 volume worth of material left. 2 more need to be made before a 5th sequel could even be considered.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of assumed this was going to be the case.  Plus, as it stands each season covers roughly a season of the year in the show.  So it's kind of fitting in a way to end after about a year's worth of Natsume getting adjusted to his new life.  I'd love to have more Natsume, but I'd be content with things concluding like this as well.
>> ARTICLE
i did not read the manga. should i go back and read them? do they have stuff that did not make it to the anime? what do you suggest?
>> ARTICLE
The manga is a great read. It consecutively stays on Japan's top release charts. It has a more.....somber...sad...melancholy feel to it than the anime. IDK how to describe it--it just clings to your heart more. The anime doesn't leave anything important out but it does leave little tidbits. I remember one of the first things left out was a flashback to Natsume's youth that just adds to his overall character.
>> ARTICLE
I think I remember seeing that it was fantastic in sales (top 3) for the last month, so it's quite possible! Assuming that the sales keep up until enough new material is out at least.
>> ARTICLE
I heard that the staff was planning to end the anime at 52 episodes, which is four seasons. However, it still sells really well so I wouldn't be too surprised to see a sequel. Though it would take at least another year before another season should be produced.

The concept is not new this time it just had far more budget to it had more advertising and better animation therefore popular. 
>> ARTICLE
So you hate a show because its more popular? Im sorry but that is incredibly unfair, especially since they are both written by the same author. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they're trying to say that because SAO was so popular, Accel World is less likely to get a second season (because SAO would get it instead).
>> ARTICLE
Yes exactly and I get down voted simply for my opinion and them not even listening to my explanation which was valid.   
>> ARTICLE
Im aware that's why I was mad because one had a much larger budget accel world would have been 1000x better with a budget and team that large working on it. Accel world felt rushed but the actual connections with the characters and the story in general were much better in my opinion.

Very good, though the overall feeling is a little bit different to Mushishi - it's 'lighter', so to speak. You definitely can't go wrong with it, though. Also while you're at it, you might want to look into Mononoke and Kino no Tabi as well - those who like Mushishi usually like those two as well.
>> ARTICLE
it's wonderful, excellent even. among the iyashikei genre of soothing, quiet narratives, it manages to package quite a lot of raw emotional power in its stranded episodes. the focus is different though, as Natsume establishes linking storylines and a reoccuring cast because it's set in one town as opposed to Mushishis distinct "traveler" feel. in that regards, you might prefer something like Kino no Tabi or Mononoke, but those series are denser and more rooted in conceptualism than on character stories. they're all incredible though, you really can't go wrong with any of the three. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved it. There's gotta be a reason why a studio that doesn't normally do sequels eventually made 4 seasons for Natsume.
>> ARTICLE
Natsume Yuujinchou is similar to Mushi-shi in that it's an episodic series, which has its roots in Japanese folklore and classic storytelling. 

They're both relaxing, as as someone else said Natsume is a very "healing" show, and is great for one or two episodes a day. It has a wonderful atmosphere, and is 100% about character development. 

It's one of those shows that starts slow and weird, and the budget for the first season is far lower than everything after it. Either way, every season is gold, and the more I watched it, the more I liked it.  To the point where I finished the fourth season, let it sit in my head for a bit, and raised all the scores from 7-8s to all 9s. I love the show and want more. 
>> ARTICLE
A little similar to Mushishi, but worse with shoujo vibe and focused on Natsume character development.

Those poor Chihayafuru sales.

High School DxD has 9 times that.. How disappointing.

9,121 / 1,914 = 4,7 Times.

Chihaya had a terrible timeslot for the type of show it was. Also, Josei seems to never get decent numbers.

Usagi Drop got passable sales
>> ARTICLE
High School DxD was only aired uncensored on one channel, so anyone who watched it on another channel saw the heavily censored version (if it was anything like the Seikon no Qwaser censoring, it's almost completely unwatchable).   
The blu-ray version offers a more, shall we say...*titillating* version, probably sparking their BD sales.

Fuck yeah, Pantsu Witches

Can't wait for the movie to be released on DVD and BD in like three fucking years

Durarara has like 60 some odd episodes with Shou, Ten, and Ketsu.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of shows do.  I crammed in as many episodes as I could to stay under 40, but still give the show an appropriate rating for the content.  Mushi-Shi's entry also doesn't have the full amount of stuff, but that's the point.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, it would be better if you filtered them out as well. Makes no sense for people who search for short shows to watch only half the series just because it is divided by more seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass has 50 eps, Bakuman has 75eps, Major has like 129 episodes, Monogatari has ~83, Clannad has 47, Ghost in the Shell SAC is 52+2hr movie, JoJo is 79 episodes and counting (will be 115 by time Part 4 ends).

Hellsing Ultimate is more like 30 episodes with its 1 hour runtime, same with Katanagatari and 24 eps.

> Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, Gintama, HxH, FMA:BH, Monster, DBZ, Bakuman, Code Geass, Durarara are among my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Did you read the rules I used for the list?

Half the point of the list was to remove second seasons of things from the top, because they require the time investment.  If the first season still does well then it's in the list because it's standalone, which second seasons are not.  
>> ARTICLE
But then, why would you include second seasons for some shows but not others? At the point, the 40 episode thing becomes a very arbitrary guideline.
>> ARTICLE
You're not even following your own rules m8
>> ARTICLE
> Rule 1: No anime longer than 40 episodes. Period.

Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show. 
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show.

I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point.  If people want to continue after that, that's their decision, but all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.  But that's ok.  I'm going to remake the list taking into account all this stuff.

truly, if this is your interpretation of your rules then your list doesn't make any sense. Everybody can continue or stop after ~40 episodes of anything (first season or not), they don't need your misguided list for that.

>  all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.

> Code Geass, Attack on Titan, Chihayafuru on the list

ok, so what you do is claiming it's enough to call something a 'first season' to make it stand alone. Because these three very clearly don't have any resolution in the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Well is certainly my fault for not explaining the purpose well.  The overarching goal was to remove incredibly long running shows, but more importantly to remove sequel bias within the context of show length.  So all these shows that are not only long, but also contain a huge score jump in the second season tend to dominate the list quite a bit. A guy a while ago made a combined season list which averaged scores, and that was awesome, but didn't necessarily remove what I feel is the heavy score bias from familiarity that plagues the top 100.   But anyway, is a moot point now. Intentions are meaningless. 
>> ARTICLE
Also Chihayafuru, Haikyuu, Mushishi, Kurono Basket, xxxHolic, Initial D, Yomamushi Pedal, Kingdom, Nodame Cantabile, Kaiji, Magi and Natsume Yuujinchouu.
>> ARTICLE
> If they rely on knowledge from previous shows, they're out. Gundam would be a good example - Gundam 00 might be fantastic (might be a bad example, I know nothing ab Gundam 00 *is* standalone. 

Gundam 00 is standalone and requires no knowledge of UC.

Yeah, figured something like that might happen.  Sorry Gundam.

>Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, absolutely. Except for Hyouka, all of my top 5 shows have more than 50 episodes. I also freaking love JJBA, One Piece and a lot more.

I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

Longer shows have a better chance to properly explore the setting and the characters and you can get easier attached to them as well. I also prefer slower pacing way more than to fast pacing, but that's just me.

Anyways, thanks for the work.

I was having a discussion with a buddy of mine about this.  We've both read the Wheel of Time series, which is good, but a massive time investment.  There are a lot of good, long running shows and if I'd started them at the time it would be fine, but trying to jump in now...not sure it's worth the time.

When i was new to anime, i was actually sad that there were so few long shows. I was in Post Anime Depression after FMA:B was my first proper anime(that i knew was anime and intentionally sought out), worse was it after doing HxH up to the airing episode (119 iirc.) in a week. Felt like i'd never find anything like them again, and i really haven't had a lot anime past that point be either. So long ones are good, as long as you don't get stuck in Naruto/Bleach fillers. Skip those if they don't please you, that's what i do. 

HxH probably has the best pacing imo. (Chimera arc exempt, that one was a bit slower IIRC.) To me, the first 20 episodes felt like 50, and in a positive way. For some reason, the 2 minute episode situation that a lot of good shows have didn't happen in HxH, though i'm not sure why. It's wasn't a bad thing, i enjoyed those long good paced episodes because they felt so filled. 

As a side note, to me, HxH was great from the beginning, so i understand that for those that didn't like it as much at the beginning, might have felt different about this. 
>> ARTICLE
Cool list! I'll have to get around to watching Rakugo sometime...

On a side note though, Gundam 00 is standalone. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the other series.
>> ARTICLE
This is super helpful.  
Nice job! MAL should try and sort out their shitty list formats too.

Why not Bake + Nise + Neko?
>> ARTICLE
Higurashi (when they cry) has a second season which pushes it to 50 episodes total. (+ several ovas, 6 of which counts as a third season)  
  
I guess you can see the first season only, but 90% of the plot of the first season is explained in the second season. It's a bit weird to only include the first season on the list, since the story doesn't make much sense without the second season to back it up. 

If I was to pick anime from a list like this, I would rather have all the shows included be 40 or less, including all relevant sequels. If I want a short anime, I don't want to discover later that there are actually two more seasons that weren't listed just to keep the episode count down. 

That's just my opinion though!  
[Good job](#bestiathumbsup)

Ha, fear not!  I'm remaking the list so there are no shows at all that go over 26 episodes!

Awesome!

YLiA #2, OPM #3, Code Geass #4. 

I am not an anti-circlejerker against YLiA or OPM (I hate Code Geass), in fact I enjoyed both for the most part. But putting them into top 5? Hah, nope. It is actually sad to see how Ping Pong and TTGL lower than them. And by god, Berserk and Tatami Galaxy are low.
>> ARTICLE
This list really saves me the trouble of watching the top stuff while having to sift through the long runners. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I never realised how many long Anime there are in the top 100 before seeing that just removing the 40+ ones moves Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso from #14 to #2. That makes me happy.

EDIT: Also I never would have guessed to see Shokugeki no Souma that high, it's great and I don't disagree with it, I just never would have expected it to.

The fact that CG is higher on this list than CB causes my joints to hurt.

Cool, thanks. Looks like I skipped a couple seasons. Dang Crunchyroll not having the second/third seasons. I'll have to watch those somewhere else I guess. 
>> ARTICLE
Are you sure Crunchyroll doesn't have the 2nd/3rd seasons?  I remember watching them from there.  Maybe they removed it.
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll might have the second/third season. The have a separate anime entirely for Natsume Yuujinchou Shi, but I just went and checked and the Natsume Yuujinchou anime has 39 episodes. So I guess they just put 1/2/3 in one anime, then made the fourth separate for whatever reason. -_-
>> ARTICLE
Why is only the newest season appealing? I've seen all of them and all the seasons are basically the same, it's just a continuation of the same premise and episodic story - as if it was one ~50 episode anime. If you won't like the other ones you won't like the last seasons. 

But since it is a pretty simple show I *guess* you could watch only the last season of it, but if you can tolerate it at all you might as well be watching the other ones.
>> ARTICLE
If you didn't like the first three then you wouldn't want to watch the fourth.

I'm guessing you saw the fourth season's high rating on MAL/AniDB/AnimePlanet etc.? Later seasons of shows tend to have higher ratings, since the only people still watching a show by it's fourth season are the people who like it. 

I will say this: I didn't like Yuujinchou at first. It took about four eps to get into it, but once I did I was hooked. It's not so much that it gets better (which, on a side note, it does), but rather that you learn to appreciate the subtlety.  
It's a lot like Mushishi in that sense.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is so good when you're in the mood to just relax and watch. It's so creative / interesting.
