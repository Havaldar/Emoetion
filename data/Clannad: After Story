Kanon (2006)

Made by the same people who made Angel Beats and Clannad. Also very good.
>> ARTICLE
The first anime that made me cry full-on was the original Kanon (2002).

Then a few years later I watched the re-make and cried all over again.
>> ARTICLE
I have to say that the last episode of Kanon had possibly the best meaningful transition into end credits ever. I managed to keep from losing it for the entire show until the last few seconds when that song started playing and I realized what the ED symbolized. (If you haven't, try reading the lyrics after the last episode and notice how the meaning shifts.)

You're probably the first one on the internet I've seen that shares my sentiment. Yes, the aunt was evil, but understandably so. Food was scarce for everyone. I did feel very sorry for the sister, because the boy didn't want to cast his pride away in order to work for food.

Kanon and Air are both by the same guys as Clannad, and pretty good. Air not so much until right towards the end if you ask me, though.

AnoHana was very good.

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Nanoha (season 3) and Madoka all made me cry as well, but they're different genre-wise.

Edit: Oh, and Toradora, though it isn't the same kind of sad/tragic drama.
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling that Key seems to have a kick for tragedy (you'll know what I mean if you happen to have seen Air, Kanon and Clannad).

I've been meaning to watch Gurren Lagann actually. Because of your recommendation I'll move it to the top of my list.

Episode 11 of TTGL had me on the brink of tears, first time ever for an anime. And the ending too. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
toradora didn't make me cry, but it was definitaly was a sad ending at least [they got back together after they graduated highschool](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
That ending pissed me off for the opposite/polar reason that a lot of people hate Clannad AS's ending. Seemed totally forced to make it more dramatic and heartfelt. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was a great ending from a story-writing perspective, just poorly executed and kind of rushed. [If you think about it, them taking separate paths for a while so she could straighten out things with her family was far better than them just running away and was the more mature way to go, and also leaves them off with a better future ahead of them. The ending failed to convey all of this properly, wasn't until later that I realized this. At the time I felt it came out of nowhere, hence the 'poorly executed' criticism.](/spoiler)

Aria the Origination, those last few episodes destroyed me.

would you put it on par with Clannad?

Well, that is a tough one. Clannad and Aria are tied for my favorite show, however I probably did cry a little more in Clannad, but Aria was still very close, and when compared to Angel Beats I cried much more at the end of Aria

I'll admit Aria made me tear up a couple of times, not so much because it was sad, but just because of the raw emotion they managed to evoke in some of the episodes/scenes. The BGM helped.

I cry during One Piece sometimes. Not because it is sad but just because there is so much emotion with the characters and the situation. I also cried during Sword of the Stranger. I teared up at the part where he yells

I think it needs to be said that Key does breather episodes (those between tear-jerking ones) better than majority of studios. In other works they feel like an absolute filler, but with Key's works you just know they're there to barely keep you from falling into absolute depression.

Angel Beats was so well done I changed my views on life

I'm with you there. After Angel Beats I was given a whole new perspective!
>> ARTICLE
They certainly got the emotions down pat near the second half.

Which kind of irks me, because Clannad actually works really well as a slice of life comedy as well, which it was for most of season 1. 

While Ushio/Nagisa thing definitely is very sad, it was so good to finally see Tomoya finally make up with Naoyuki Okazaki, his father.  That was honestly the most tearjerking thing about the show, that the viewers didn't know that Naoyuki suffered the same way as Tomoya did and both Tomoya and the viewers started to realize it near the end of the series, and Tomoya felt he had to make it right. That flashback scene of Naoyuki taking care of the child Tomoya was intensely emotional.
>> ARTICLE
They are alive
>> ARTICLE
To straight forward, where's the proof?
>> ARTICLE
You said it yourself. You hear her voice at the end which is telling you that she is alive. Fuuko is not in a coma because if she was, she would have never been able get anywhere near that tree in bed. If you recall the last episode of AS. You would have seen that Tomoya made a wish and wished it all never happened, but ends up regretting it later after seeing Nagisa. He ends going back to when Ushio was born, Nagisa lives and all is good. The OVA takes place after that last episode.
>> ARTICLE
The last episode the only thing you see is Ushio sleeping under the tree at the end. It isn't until the OVA when everything I talked about went down, but it all seemed to much like a dream.
>> ARTICLE
> but it all seemed to much like a dream

How so? If you retain the memories of, what is unknown to you a "previous" life, how else would you explain it but as a dream?
>> ARTICLE
It's just so hard to accept with how cryptic the ending was. But it is true if you retain memories from a previous life they would just seem like a dream because it "never" happened to you during your current life.

>> ARTICLE
I've written a fully fleshed out explanation of the whole thing so many times, I don't have it in me to do it again. This is my TL;DR...

- They die

- When the alternate dimension merges with the original reality, he has an opportunity to submit the wish based off of the orbs he'd collected by doing good deeds around town.

- Tomoya decides life is full of troublesome things and he doesn't want to regret meeting the love of his life because hardships might come along.

- The alternate dimension Ushio lives on that world and essentially sacrifices herself there to activate the wish via orbs, "resetting" everything that had happened from the birth and so forth.

- The birth is a success and they live happily ever after as shown by them having a nap by the tree and Nagisa calling to them. 
>> ARTICLE
you should write it out once, then just link them to your comment every time you need to do it.
>> ARTICLE
I've written it out twice before but it was like 6+ months back and I don't know where to find it now :/
>> ARTICLE
It would be a pretty extreme way to end a show if it ended with both Nagisa, and Ushio dying followed shortly by Tomoya launching himself off a bridge. If they wanted to do a more realistic ending, and still not have everyone want to off themselves, they could have ended it right before Ushio gets sick. Tomoya has overcome a lot, and his family is back together. Don't forget too that Nagisa's and Ushio's sickness itself is almost of a magic nature, none of the doctor's know what it is etc etc. All that being said, it's still the best.
>> ARTICLE
They are alive.

Also, I like to think Ushio and Nagisa dying was all Ushio's dream since briefly after the anime ended(*technically*), we cut to Fuko smelling Ushio's scene and we find her sleeping under a tree.

That's what I think but I'm probably wrong.
>> ARTICLE
That's quite the extreme dream for a 5 year old to have. XD
>> ARTICLE
It's quite plausible though. 

Heck, we could have dreamt like this but we have just forgotten it over time.

I've read somewhere around the Internet that 5 year olds can indeed dream of death and other extreme things because that's the age where they start to grasp reality.

That's interesting and terrifying at the same time.

damn now ive got to rewatch clannad.. as If Im not watching enough already...

Nothing mattered and the ending was a cop out.
>> ARTICLE
> the ending was a cop out     

I don't think that is necessarily true, with the alternate world snippets (the girl and the robot) they were planning that ending from the start.
>> ARTICLE
It was poorly explained. I have a feeling it was better explained in the VN(Key being what it is) and the entire events were just so "neatly" wrapped up that its too good to be true. Cop out or not, it still robs the show of any emotional weight it had before.
>> ARTICLE
Light novel?

Fixed
>> ARTICLE
I do know that they have a Light Novel out, sekaiproject just recently wrapped up a kick starter which was very successful. So there should be an official English translated Light Novel out shortly.
>> ARTICLE
*visual novel
>> ARTICLE
I'll agree with you on the emotion robbing, I went from super sad to just confused at the end. I felt like the explanation of the super natural events didn't really need to go into anymore detail than it did. 

Tomoya was granted a light for reconciling with his father and used it when Ushio passed (which was the snow flake that landed on his chest where the light had landed).
>> ARTICLE
If you think about it for a bit it all wraps up nicely, the legend of the the town and Kotomi's parents theory on alternate dimensions.
>> ARTICLE
Do you think we could have just been seeing an alternate dimension of Nagisa dying vs. one where she doesn't? And Tomoya was able to make some sort of connection between the two which was why he had "memories" of her and Ushio dying?
>> ARTICLE
No, there is only one alternative dimension in the anime, the Illusionary World. Once Ushio and robot Tomoya remember who they are they use the orbs collected throughout both seasons to send Tomoyas soul back to when Ushio was born. The town now being stronger thanks to Tomoyas endeavors could keep Nagisa alive this time around. Simple as that. Despite the change it all still happened in the same timeline/dimension thus of course Tomoya would still remember everything that happened.
>> ARTICLE
How was that exactly a cop out when it was already intentionally planned in the first episode? 
>> ARTICLE
Because it robs the show of any weight it could've had in the past with a "and they lived happily ever after" ending.
>> ARTICLE
Because it would've had a lot more impact when and a much more profound(*and realistically true*) statement if it didn't need any supernatural elements to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, and would leave you an emotional wreck. If you like feeling miserable and sad, why won't you go and watch little kittens starve and die?

Clannad is crueler than that by giving you a sense of owning a puppy while slowly taking it away from you by infecting it with ~~KEY AIDS~~ an incurable disease.

No wait, do you have the Dragonballs? OK, here you go, 100% functional and vaccinated!
>> ARTICLE
It was "CLANNAIDS" last time I've heard about it.

That's the first time I see the comparison between Dragon Balls and light orbs, but it's perfect. I like to think of light orbs being rewards for different versions of Tomoya working his ass off to make people happy.
>> ARTICLE
It's not a cop out, this is the true end of the visual novel, after getting all the endings gathering the orbs of hapiness Tomoya gets granted the happy ending where Nagisa lives.

You have already played the route where she dies before getting the ending you see in the anime, they tried to show you how he gets the orbs, they even tell you that if you gather enough you will have a wish come true.

I know they don't really go into detail with the second world but they tell you enough to understand why the ending is real, hell they even show you the snow being replaced with orbs!

People can talk a lot of shit about Clannad because it's not perfect but the ending is not a reason to hate it because if you didn't understand why it happend you clearly didn't pay attention.
>> ARTICLE
> hell they even show you the snow being replaced with orbs!

Oh true, with the whole alternate world turning "white". But what was Ushio's connection with the girl in the alternate world anyway. Ushio was the girl and Tomoya was the robot. I'm assuming that Ushio is the embodiment of mother nature or mother nature's daughter and both of their deaths were due to the changing of the town.
>> ARTICLE
The anime does a very bad job at explaining what the second world is, and honestly It's been quite a long time since I played the visual novel but they do explain it in more details.

Their deaths is not really supposed to be explained like it was a consequense of anything, but more that they surviving was a miracle created by the hapiness Tomoya spread throughout the town.

If you got the time I would highly recommend the visual novel because there is A LOT of material that isn't covered but it is a mega long visual novel and very slow at times but where in the anime that give you mostly the information you need to understand the characters, the visual novels goes way more in depth with everything.

Thus the moral of the story is that Dragonballs make for happy time resets!
>> ARTICLE
The moral of the story was to care for your close ones. The Dragonballs made that moral into a more literal aspect of the setting.
>> ARTICLE
Yet it posed the question what would happen to that devotion when said close ones are (forcibly) taken away, just to ignore it for its own delusion.
>> ARTICLE
You got that backwards. Losing Nagisa and everything following that was meant to make Tomoya realize how devoted he truly was to begin with. If your question was the case then the show should've/would've focused more on how he coped with the depression.

Or you know... have actual *realistic impact as a grounded slice of life* despite being overly romanticised.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I'm not following. What's the context? Dealing with your question would make it realistic and impactfull?
>> ARTICLE
It was not a time reset!

IT WAS A DIFFERENT ENDING! I don't know if you have played a visual novel before, but you usually have to play it quite a few times to actually get the FINAL ENDING or the true ending instead of you just doing something different Key likes using magic to explain why the same scenario can have a different outcome that is how they do it.

The magic in Clannad is the orbs which you have collected throughout the game, you get them from every ending/ character you complete, after you got them all you get the final ending with Nagisa surviving.

The anime might have showed it badly or you just don't want to deal with how Key likes to explain why you need to play the game so many times to get the final ending.

You can watch or read all of Keys work and they do the same thing every time, they use magic since I don't know how familiar you are with Keys works I can't really come with an example.

They just tried to make a coherent story instead of first telling you they all died, okay next time on Clannad Tomoya lives!
>> ARTICLE
Life is so wonderful when it's a Groundhog's Day mechanic.
>> ARTICLE
Are you even reading what I write or are you just trying to not understand VISUAL NOVEL MECHANICS.

I can instead ask you, why shouldn't they use the TRUE ENDING?

It's the ending you spend 200+ hours trying to get in the game and just completely forget about the second world which Nagisa even performs a play off and just make it "Nagisa likes to daydream a lot" and just cut out an essential part of the visual novel.

If you don't like magic in your shows stay away from any Key works because they all use it.

Or if you don't like happy endings when the show could clearly have a bad end stay away from visual novel adaptations.
>> ARTICLE
But they excuse all that in-game by Tomoya being sent to various dimensions. Since Tomoya loses his memories between each dimension it could indeed be deemed as resets, just not specifically "time-resets".
>> ARTICLE
I guess you could call it resets, but my point was more that it isn't that the other endings never happend they all happend but just in different worlds.

I know it's kinda weird when they are making one big coherent route, but the orb mechanic stay the same.
>> ARTICLE
Get the visual novel. You can CTRL skip your way through most routes, because let's be fair - they're boring. As. Shit. It's a 300 hours long game, it's not going to be AAA grade material all the time.  
The only important ones are main, AS, Kotomi's (multiverse theory her parents mentioned), Fuuko's (astral projection up in this motherfucker), Yukine's (light orbs fable), and Akio's (not really a route per se, but imo he's much bigger figure in Nagisa's life than her mother).

Contrary to what wikis say, there is a completely translated Clannad version. I've played it to 100% completion as early as January 2009. Why it takes so long to officially release it is beyond me. I mean, the way things are, we're going to get things in this order: heat death of the universe, JAST USA announces Sumaga release date, Clannad English script in final QC phase, Gutts gets off the fucking boat.

Lets just wait until you feel the void after watching this.
>> ARTICLE
> This was this most emotionally moving anime I have ever had the pleasure of watching.

The most emotionally moving anime for me are Welcome to the NHK, THe King of Pigs, Great Teacher Onizuka, and Texhnolyze's last arc. Just to be clear, the drama those shows offer is from an entirely different style and Clannad has nothing on the realistic grime oppression those offer.

>  It was beautifully animated, well ~~written~~ directed and had a fantastic OST.

No, it was pretty badly written, including the After Story. The supernatural elements were hamfisted and they played a very arbitrary part in the narrative to reinforce it's delusion. All the girls are annoying archetypes with Tomoyo just being a tolerable dandere. The family aspect is hampered by the useless doll that is Nagisa who magically turns into the Mary Sue wife, who is still just as hollow from *actual* personality.

> 10/10 for me, would watch again and Nagisa has become one of my biggest inspirations in life now.

OK... she's fine as in ideal, so long as you treat her as [the concept that she is](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko).

> And Nagisa is never actually seen a live with the exception of memories that Tomoya has, you only hear her voice calling out to them at the end.

She's alive, they're both alive. simple as that, here's your vague-but-not-really happy ending.

TBH scrap the other world crap, and just have Kyou pull out our Tomoya out of depression. Idk, have an *actual* arc where he's pretty much his dad, except he *has* no family to speak of outside of him, then slowly have Kyou accommodate and visit him.
>> ARTICLE
Of the shows you listed, the only one I've seen is Welcome to the NHK, and it's up there with my favorites. Personally, Clannad's melodrama made it impossible for me to get emotionally invested enough in it to have any impact on me. Slow motion, sad music playing, close-up on the characters crying - it felt like the show was just yelling at me "LOOK AT ALL THIS SAD STUFF! DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU SAD!? BE SAD NOW!" Frankly, I can't help but laugh at something so blatant. 

This is in stark contrast to Welcome to the NHK where we may have just seen Satou have a panic attack and now we see him receding back in his room, lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling while smoking a cigarette. Nothing is said, [NHK's signature sullen song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ei2izPLpHc) plays in the background. Rather than have the show throw the feelings at you, the feelings come naturally out of empathy for the character. The mood is implicit. I find this far more effective than Clannad's "explicit mood-setting." Clannad reminds me of the Robot Devil, from Futurama: "You can't just have your characters announce how they feel! That makes me feel angry!"
>> ARTICLE
> Nothing is said, NHK's signature sullen song  plays in the background. Rather than have the show throw the feelings at you, the feelings come naturally out of empathy for the character.

What makes this more disappointing is that Clannad's directing that makes the themes shine could've made it just like that, but thanks to the screenplay and music just have to really corner you into relating with the characters instead of freely empathizing with them just by seeing what they're going through and dealing with it instead of wallowing in it.

[Cheers on NHK though.](http://youtu.be/VW2mRF6-zJ0)

I feel like this would have been a true ending barring the "other world" stuff. I, like many others, had invested lots of connection with Tomoya during his character growth and had grown to accept that Nagisa had passed on and was hoping he would too. The restart provided by the "other world" felt like it cheapened all of his character development and stomped on the true moral of what he was going through: Life is hard and life is full of loss. You move on and grow stronger from it.

Tomoya could have easily ended up with Kyou after a couple of years and it would have been a realistic ending to a great series. 

TLDR; Life throws you some mean curve balls but you have to suck it up and grow from them. Not hope that magical balls falling from the sky gives you a free restart where everything ends perfect. 
>> ARTICLE
Do you think Tomoya could have pulled himself out of depression after Ushio passed away as well. Personally I don't know what I would do if not only my wife died but literally just after I reconnect with my daughter she drops too. That's some pretty heavy stuff to carry, I was half expecting him to just end up like his father and drink himself to sleep every night.
>> ARTICLE
His Dad lived only because of Tomoya, Tomoya doesn't have anyone that responsibility... guess what kind of ending comes to mind then.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah this was pretty much where I was headed with him losing everything. I don't think he would have lasted much longer after Ushio passed. But Sanae and Akio are both great support so it could have gone through. 
>> ARTICLE
Tomoya finds the strength to move on through his depression by reconnecting with Ushio. What starts as a "do it for Nagisa" turns into actual love for his daughter and through that he finds reason to live again. This is a pretty natural progression. It really makes the time you invest into Tomoya feel real.

As far as Ushio dying? I don't 100% understand what was going on in the other world other than the orbs Tomoya "collects" grant him that final wish. I felt that Ushio dying was the creators last chance to hit you in the feels. Except at that point I had thrown my hands in the air like "Come the fuck on, what else can happen?" It felt recycled I guess.

Lastly, the reset felt like it was the creators apology note to the viewer for kicking them in the heart balls for the last time and just kind of said JK HAPPY END.

Sorry for the rant.
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting that it felt recycled to you considering that it's only the second time something like that happens
>> ARTICLE
Nagisa was heavy but it I took it as "damn, one more thing Tomoya must over come in life. That's rough."

Ushio going the same way just kinda made me roll my eyes. It felt like they were trying to squeeze one more -thing- just so they could say they did it. 

As you can tell, Tomoya's character development was the most important part of Clannad for me haha.
>> ARTICLE
Do you girl, /r/anime could use more content!

Clannad was a pretty typical harem anime, in my eyes.  Then After Story cranked the realistic knob, everything went sideways, and I actually got a worthwhile story.  An anime doesn't have to have a happy ending, even if it started as a light-hearted high school romance.

[And if not for](/s "all the light-orb bullshit,") I think it would just be too depressing.
>> ARTICLE
Well the ending was kinda happy, since Nagisa, Ushio, Fuko and Tomoya were all together at the very end right?
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like the fantasy ending. It could have worked if they had gone more into it through out the show, but to all of the sudden give you a fucked up heart breaking moment that just sucks out your existence and then go "lol jk here's some magic it's all good". I didn't like it. I've read in other comments that they do explain the orbs and the other world and all that throughout the VN. I think they should have done that with the anime and not just give really vague intros and hints like they did in the anime.

Still despite all that, I loved the series, I was glad they got a happy ending but the way they did it kinda didn't work for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the ending was pretty bad.

Seems that if they wanted[](/s "a happy ending, a better way of dealing with it would be that Tomoya with the help of Ushio finaly would get over Nagisas death and with Tomoyas help Ushio would survive the sickness that killed her mother. The way they did it kinda made it feel like they were to afraid of the reactions of a sad ending so they changed it to a good one last minute. It's the "A wizzard did it" or "It was all a dream" type of ending. I'm not saying that's how it should have ended, but that's one way of making it a happy ending that would follow the logical flow of the story better.") 

I havn't played the game, but if they did this ending to stay true to the source material, my answer to that is that they shouldn't have. The series is good up to that point though.

Coming from someone who hates Disney happy endings and loves ambivalent European downer movies, it's odd that I defend this show, but I think the lesson that Clannad is trying to teach was never a "life is hard, deal with it and move on" type of lesson that a sad ending would imply. It's more about the cycle on the wheel of existence, of eternal return and redemption. In other words, it's a spiritual journey not a dramedy about life and death. So, you just didn't like the premise just the same as someone who watches Passion of the Christ and doesn't get the point of him coming back to life after getting his ass kicked for 2 hours.

It's myth logic not real logic. In some shows like Humanity is in Decline, it's very obvious that the universe does not run on our rules of logic so it is easy to judge it, whereas Clannad has the illusion of being very real but it's not, it's a dream all the way through (like Inception). Perhaps our universe itself is some girl dreaming by a tree somewhere out there.

Personally, I like to think there were two possible endings.

First, while holding Ushio as he lost her, he finally gave up, collapsing in the snow, and stayed there until the warmth of death came upon him, and then it shows them in the afterlife, together.

Or, at the moment he lost his child, there he lays, in the snow, completely giving up on everything, as it seems every time he comes close to happiness, it is taken away from him, his father finds him in an almost dead state. He rushes him to the hospital, they save his life, but his mental state has deteriorated, and has to live in a mental hospital for the rest of his life. The following scenes are his delusions of what he wished it could have been like.

Why do I look at it this way? Because, I felt cheated when it came to a happy ending with this show. Although, it may be happy depending on how you look at it, because he finally had the family he wanted, even if it was all just in his head(Or in the afterlife).
>> ARTICLE
I was going to reply with something along these lines, thanks for saving me the trouble.

I'm a sucker for bittersweet story, but this one just had too much sugar in it at the very end. It was still a great show, and the emotional roller-coaster that I went through during the second season was well worth my time, but it would have been better without the last episode. Up to that point, it was probably one of the most down-to-earth anime I watched  (first seasons, not so much).
>> ARTICLE
I thought the ending was horrible, VN or not.

*Prepares for downvotes*, don't fail me now, r/anime
>> ARTICLE
Why did you think the ending was horrible? What do you think they should have done with the ending instead?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not about to put spoiler marks but I think it should've ended on a sad note, if you know what I mean.  I realize it was adapted from a VN and they couldn't change it to the extreme that I would like, so I'm not mad or anything, I just thought it was a cop out.

Thanks for writing exactly how I felt about the ending.

The whole magic part pretty much pissed me off.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. In some ways I actually preferred the Clannad movie ending (non-canonical of course) to the Clannad AS ending, if only because the movie didn't require a literal deus ex machina. I hear a lot about how the miracle ending of AS was necessary to preserve the theme of family, but I argue that killing major characters (twice!) wasn't.

I still preferred Clannad AS a bit more for the production values and manly tears, and it's adherence to the VN, which I can always appreciate.
>> ARTICLE
Oh well. When I first saw it cold, with absolutely no idea about VN, Key or anything else about this sub-genre of anime I instantly got that this show from the beginning was a fantasy, so the ending did not shock me at all. I came upon the /r/anime discussions after I finished this series looking for more info about it and was surprised at the peeps who reacted badly to the fantasy elements. I guess mileage does vary...
>> ARTICLE
I thought that it was built up well, and there were already more than a few fantasy elements leading up to that, especially Fuuko. This is without mentioning that the light-orbs were already in the story, as well as the afterlife-esque subplot.

I guess the ending is a little bit fairytailish, and I'm actually the kind of person that is sick of everything always having a happy ending, but I thought it was appropriate. Okazaki deserved a happy family. 
>> ARTICLE
The supernatural element didn't bother me so much as the outcome of it. Episodes 16-21 of After Story are simply incredible, never have I had an anime evoke such strong emotions. For all of that development to be more or less undone by the ending kind of cheapened it.

I think it would have been better if things had just carried on going the way they were. Okazaki coming to terms with his new life, resolving to become a good father, and moving past Nagisa's death. It could still have been a happy ending, not to mention a far more powerful one.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the fantasy element was very well executed. The illusory world plot had been established since the very beginning, and between a girl in a coma appearing as a ghost to people and a kid who turns into a cat, I felt the magic elements in the ending weren't out of place at all. It's not like Tomoya didn't have to work for it, either.

sorry for bothering so many people with my post I should have checked around more to see if this sort of thing was here.

hehe. I'm one of the ardent fans of this show, so I certainly don't mind another member of the club coming out in the main anime forum. Welcome!

The more people that view this anime the merrier!
>> ARTICLE
Okazaki was by far the most extensively developed character I've seen in an anime. I was absolutely astounded at how they took a generic, cynical, self-insert harem lead and turn him into a real human being that I feel I understand as well as I understand myself
>> ARTICLE
You want to provide some examples?

Because he's as cardboard as you can get.

Maybe I'm in the minority, but it felt forced and abrupt often with him. Every other episode he had some life altering realization. 
>> ARTICLE
Lots of stuff has been said about Clannad already. Actually, anything you might have to say has been said a lot of times on /r/anime already. [Search](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/search?q=clannad&restrict_sr=on).
>> ARTICLE
You'll get downvoted a lot, mostly because this kind of thread appears a bit too often in this subreddit about Clannad and few others shows.  
Not saying it's right, i do not approve that, it's just like that.  
That said, the anime:  
Loved Clannad AS from start to finish, it's a really well done story about family values, and i honestly belive watching that made me a bit better as a person. (Yeah, i think it's that good)  
When you think back you notice the story touch many different kind of family situations or problems, giving a great number of positive messages inside of it, despite all the drama.  
Really a great work, if you enjoyed it take also a look at "Hoshi o Ou Kodmo" (an anime movie)  
It's not really similar to be honest, it's more a Ghibli style story, but it's another meaningful anime about human relations.
>> ARTICLE
I loved it, I just finished it the other week and it too was one of the best I've seen. Okazaki was really well developed. It was a sad, sad anime for me. I teared up a bunch, definitely not expecting *that* to happen in the second to last episode. But the ending made me feel warm on the inside, even though I thought it kind of came from left field. 
>> ARTICLE
Lol everyone has these threads but I'd like to make a point. 

First off, my thoughts. Overall it was good. Art style is a little weird (The girls look like they have some sort of disorder) but everything is still beautiful. Story, only HALF good. I liked the Fuko stuff, and of course anything with Akio but some of the Arcs were bullshit. The gang fight and the my little sister is so cute part. Garbage. She should have stayed dead at the end too. Without the kid dying. But that's just my quit overview. Here's my main point.

What is the relation to people crying a lot and then "really liking" an anime? I'm curious because while I cried like a bitch in Clannad, I can't say it was even in my top 5. I think it has something to do with what makes you cry. I cried because it was shitty for Tomoya, although my life had no similar situations. Does anybody have a similar situation? Like you lost your lover early on? How does this show portray that?

This is quickly becoming a wall of text so I'll stop for now. Please ask me questions or request that I expand on something I'm really bored!
>> ARTICLE
haha I get what you're saying I really liked it mostly because I based it off a few things, first I cried because the characters meant something to me kinda like there are some characters in other shows you kinda almost want to die because you don't like them however I never really got that feeling with Clannad. The next reason was because I felt truly immersed in the story to the point that it was like living in Tomoya's shoes and feeling the same kind of sorrow he felt. Then some other things I won't really elaborate on because they are personal bias
>> ARTICLE
Elaborate. I love bias.
>> ARTICLE
well I actually kinda like the art style, even though I will admit it is pretty borderline chibi on the eyes. And for some reason it feels like the characters just clique with me which I can't really explain I guess. I also found for the most part all the arcs entertaining because I just found the humor in the show unreasonably funny for no apparent reason. Kinda just a bunch of random things about the show that all came together for me
>> ARTICLE
What exactly is your definition of chibi? You almost make it sound like a bad thing. 

Chibi are these short character with big head and eyes used in funny scenes
>> ARTICLE
It effected me for multiple reasons, first the magical elements were endearing--just the style and tone evoked charm combined with sentimental sadness. Yes, it was manipulative, but it worked on me. The story of the girl and robot had a certain existential loneliness that vibed with me from the start.

I've been a long reader of fantastic (as in speculative fiction) literature, so the whole mystical framework of alternate worlds, alternate lives, the connectedness of life, magical realist mishmash that Key all wove into this story just really resonated with my personal philosophies.

As for similar situations, several things hit me pretty close:

I had a mixed relationship with my father, where I resented him for a long time and didn't realize the sacrifices he had to make. It helped me forgive his failings and weaknesses. I had only learned recently before his death that he had wanted to be an actor but had given it up years ago.

The sole reason I bought AS was the cover of Nagisa with a laundry basket; it reminded me of the early days of my marriage living in a tiny one bedroom flat on the Westside of Los Angeles, with a summer sky and a white blanket on the balcony whipping in the wind. Nagisa reminds me of the sweetness and innocence of those days, although there were many down times too. Pretty much my family is the main thing waking me up in the morning to go to work. My wife is working part time at a bakery just like Nagisa's folks (french style baguettes and pastries you pick into a basket). The show is a reminder to me that I promised to take care of her and our daughters...oh ya, the birth scene is pretty traumatic for me for those reasons. Ya, that reminds me, I gotta take them someplace nice this Labor Day weekend.

Ya, the gang arc was pretty lame.


>> ARTICLE
I don't want to hijack the topic, but what others bittersweet series would you guys recommend (TTGL and the like don't count, even if manly tears were shed)?  Some of my personal favorites were

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0: very depressing story of 2 kids surviving an Earth quake, and looking for their parents in the aftermath

Welcome to the NHK: Maybe not "depressing" in the same sense, but this show is bound to hit you a few times.

Shigofumi:  a god delivering "after death letters" to human

I thought the relationships between the characters were well developed and very touching.
I've only cried once in Angel Beats, once in Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, and when Krillin died in Dragonball/Z.
I cried 5 times in After Story.
The ending was kinda cool, but I had to google to understand it. The girl with the robot crap made no sense to me for the entire anime, and I didn't fully understand it at the end.


>> ARTICLE
I like to think the girl with the robot was used as a foreshadowing tool and it reflected the mental state of the series. Or maybe I just miss the mindfuck that was the last episode of NGE haha.

When I watched the end of it, it reminded me of the Wayne's World ending.

Sword Art Online?

Doesn't fall in a genre related to Clannad, but a brilliant anime none the less. LN is admittedly better, but the anime is still in my top 5. 
>> ARTICLE
I was crying like almost every episode of After Story.. Especially when Ushio said Sanae told her the only places to cry were in the bathroom or papa's arms.. Man that hit me like crazy
>> ARTICLE
My tears poured down when akio told sanae that she can now cry after 5 years of holding it back. That I think was a gem and such an underrated scene.
>> ARTICLE
Totally true, my tear just falling down like waterfall
>> ARTICLE
I think another underrated scene was the gang fight and when they found out that girls brother was dead and they all prayed at his graveyard.. That part hit me good and I never see anyone talk about that
>> ARTICLE
Also, Nagisa's graduation scene, and [spoilers](/s "the proposal when Tomoya has a breakdown over his father and she calms him down.") The show was beautiful through and through for me. People talk about the biggest 2 (3?) events in After Story but the first season and the couple arcs or so in the beginning of After Story constantly had me going as well.
>> ARTICLE
Akio and Sanae are pretty much the greatest parents in all of anime so any emotional scenes regarding them really got to me.
>> ARTICLE
And the scene in the train afterwards got me even harder. When he suddenly got the flashbacks and started crying, thinking and talking about Nagisa... man
>> ARTICLE
These comments about Clannad are reminding me of it and gives me that heavy feeling below my throat. This is quite a feat. No other show gives me this feeling by just getting reminded of its circumstances.

It will always have a special place in my heart.

Clannad is so good that I don't have the balls to watch it more than once a year. Everytime I watch it I still cry.

I first watched that show about 3 years ago and I have refused to rewatch it so far. I've rewatched most series that I've enjoyed but I can't  watch that show again, despite it being one of my favorite shows.

Reason #1-100 why I won't watch this series. No regrets about it either.

I usually can't stand it when a series is devastatingly sad, but it's so worth it in this case. Trust me/us.

Duude, do it!  I avoided it for the longest time for exactly that reason, but you just have to take my word for it: it's entirely worth your time.

Maybe one day, when I become man enough.

The vast majority of Clannad is not sad: incredibly emotional, yes, but it's not exceedingly sad at more than a couple instances.  Even After Story really only gets sad in the last third.

It's actually pretty god damn hilarious most of the time.
>> ARTICLE
Aside from a couple moments, yep!  Had me laughing my ass off a lot.
>> ARTICLE
At least you admit that you aren't man enough to enjoy crying because something moved you.

I suggest doing it though. Being moved to tears is amazing. Crying over a work of fiction is proof of its depth and value, because it upsets some part of you even when nothing worth crying about has actually happened to you.

That's exactly when it hit me the hardest, too. [That](/s "damned field of flowers scene caused an old, grizzled fart like me to weep.") Warning: [don't listen to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tix_s6K9NU0).

I fully agree with you, although for me, I felt sad and shed a little tear at the end. What really hit me unexpectedly is it coming back and haunting me to tears, worse than right after I finished it, two years afterwards. Only two other anime ever did that to me: AnoHana, and Wolf Children.
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing about [huge spoilers](/s "Nagisa's death"). It's probably the most important part of the plot of *After Story*, but I think most people wouldn't even put it in the top 5 most emotional moments.

That's why I love *Clannad*, and especially the scene you mention in your second spoiler. It really catches you off guard... one sentence, said at the right time, will completely break your heart.

[Another one of my favorite examples:](/s "When Tomoya overhears Nagisa's parents talking, the first time you see Sanae crying over Nagisa's death.") That destroyed me almost as much as the famous Ushio scene.
>> ARTICLE
The scene where they look for the toy in the field, just typing this is enough to give a big knot in my chest.
>> ARTICLE
If you haven't finished it yet, you're in for a good time. Based off your second spoiler, this is when it starts.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I already stayed up an hour later than I had been planning so I'm probably gonna binge Saturday night.  I can't wait, I have a newfound respect for the series.  After I watched the scene from my first spoiler, I thought that either the show had been overhyped or I'm ridiculously jaded, because that's just about as sad of a thing as can happen.  Oh my god though, when [spoiler](/s "Ushio said that Sanae told her she could cry in daddy's arms"), I completely broke down and I cried well through the end of the episode.  Nothing (aside from seriously traumatic events in my own life) has _ever_ affected me nearly that heavily.
>> ARTICLE
That series was the first anime that ever made me cry, from where you left off there's a lot more feels coming.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I watched this anime about half a month ago. I can watch about 10 seconds of just that scene without any buildup and I'll still tear up. The only other anime that can do that to me is AnoHana.
>> ARTICLE
Right?  I was going to watch one more, but just the intro sequence had me breaking down again.  That is an effort for another day.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad isn't sad.
>> ARTICLE
I bet your life is, though.
>> ARTICLE
I'll just provide my opinion here about how one could see it as not sad. To sort of backup /u/OtakuKitten here. I agree that it is sad, but a HUGE turnoff for me was the sortoff... magicalness of the show. I got close, but I didn't ever cry during clannad because I just couldn't take it seriously. 

[spoilers](/s "Nagisa's sickness is never explained properly, and as such, it makes it seem as if the writers just want an excuse to make the story sad, rather than for it to actually be a necessary part of the plot.")

[spoilers](/s "Sure, her dad saved her by praying, and gave her life, but then that grant on her life weared out. It makes sense through a magical world, but that point didn't serve as a plot, and it didn't seem to serve as really anything other than an excuse for having Nagisa die.")

[spoilers](/s "People do have sicknesses like Nagisa. I'm fine with that. But my mind could never let go of the idea that the writer is likely making the ideas of wishes and souls and sickness etc, all just to make ends meet. Nagisa's sickness seems to be for the large part left as it is. Nobody does proper research such as sending her to specialist or even to a normal hospital. Nobody examines her properly. Nobody tries to just UNDERSTAND what on earth is going on. I've personally had health problems for 2 years without a diagnosis, and I know personally that you get really pissed off when nothing is being done, yet Nagisa shows no signs of this. It all just feels like forced sadness. I think the reason it was left alone, is because the writer didn't develop the idea enough. It was just used as a copout")

[final rant+huge spoilers](/s "This is reinforced further by the ending. The first ending of sorts was so incredibly sad, so as a copout, they just reversed it to show a happy alternate life granted by a wish... yay. All this wraps up to me having trouble feeling sympathy for the characters, and taking the story seriously in general")
>> ARTICLE
Seems you just have an issue with the fact that the anime is a supernatural one. Which is fine, but that is just part of the show. Supernatural aspects were a part of the show since episode one, and were there as a mystery.

In response to your thoughts on her [illness, I have to disagree. People don't have sicknesses like Nagisa's. Doctors tried to find things out about her illness, as Nagisa said herself, but they couldn't find anything. It is hinted that her disease is a supernatural one, one above the knowledge of doctors. It isn't explained properly because the whole supernatural part of the show is a mystery. The Illusionary World was never fully explained, even at the end, cause they left it to your speculation. Same thing with the disease. They keep it a mystery by never really explaining it.](/spoiler)

[The thing is, you can argue that the only reason for the Illusionary World plot line was to let Nagisa come back to life after death, and perhaps you are right. But the fact is, if they killed her, she had to come back to life to fit the story. Clannad isn't a tragedy anime. In fact, it is for the majority of the first season, quite lighthearted and funny. It has its emotion, but never as far as death. The point of the anime isn't its sadness, but its life messages, messages that are advanced from the death of Nagisa and Ushio. But if they stayed dead, those messages would have lost their meaning, the anime would be a whole new show, not a sign of hope but a sign of despair.](/spoiler)

[There was never a cop out ending. Literally the entire show in both worlds built up to the finale where the two plot lines combined. If you don't like the supernatural aspects of the anime, then I can understand why the ending would be sort of a turnoff. But the ending was necessary to keep the identity of the show, and everything that requires interpretation was explained throughout the anime if you do a little thinking](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
Very well written and well put response. I agree with you on the first part, I didn't really remember that part. I'd say that's it. My only real issue is the supernatural part. I think the only grudge I have against it, is that the supernatural part felt a bit out of place.

[slight spoilers](/s "They had a slice of life kind of atmosphere going on, and the supernatural part of it only really showed itself properly around the end. It didn't feel natural, or like something I should accept. It may have been supernatural, but it sorta just felt too... out of place to feel connected to the story anymore.")

[spoilers?](/s "I went really off track and it turned into a sorta rant about my disappointment in the show, but the original point I wanted to make was that I felt disconnected from the characters, and I couldn't sympathize greatly with them. It was a very sad story, but the sadness felt a bit awkward, and I didn't end up crying like I'm apparently supposed to.")

[?](/s "in the end, I suppose I don't really remember much of it, so my points up to now may be flawed. I agree with your points. I just didn't like it, and that's about it")
>> ARTICLE
Well I respect your opinion. I disagree, but I am not like those who believe there is one opinion in the world and every other is wrong.

I know people from both sides of the argument, that [the ending was well made and a was a well way to close the anime, and those that think the last episode should have been removed and Tomoya should have ended up in the snow to end it. Personally, I do agree that the ending scene could have been touched up a little bit to make it a bit more understandable to the first time watcher, I don't deny that. But I think that you just can't make the error and call Clannad a realistic show. It has ghosts of students, orbs of light that grant wishes, and a whole different parallel world with a whole different story sealed away, it just isn't completely realistic. But personally I think that the story could have been realistic OR supernatural, it would just be a different story with different goals, and I don't think the supernatural choice takes away from anything, I think it is well woven in and adds to the show in its own way. You dont think so, and you have every right to that opinion.](/spoiler)

Ah the famous episode 18.
    
You only have to say episode 18, and anime fans will know which anime you are talking about (Given that they have seen AS of course).
    
The power of the episode really comes from the natural progression of it. At no time during the episode does the drama feels forced or out of place, yet it still manage to hold much power due to, I would say, how honest this episode was. It didn't try to trick me into cheesy monologues and nonsense shouting to bring more drama than it should. Not at all, the episode was simply about man finally mourning the death of his wife. And for everyone who had trouble mourning in the past, it goes without saying that this episode has hit home for many of them.

I mean fuck, I didn't even like After Story, but even I can't deny the masterpiece that was episode 18.
>> ARTICLE
Best episode of all time. We've only known Ushio for 2 episodes and she already has the power to bring us to tears.

["Is it ok not to hold it in anymore?"](http://i.imgur.com/9w3rrvQ.gif) 

Good glorious God that scene hits harder than anything I've ever witnessed. 
>> ARTICLE
Just saying those words in my head immediately makes my eyes water.
>> ARTICLE
I personally thought that the scene on the train near the end was more impactful, but thats a close runner-up.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck. This scene broke me, man. Seriously, this episode opened a door that I can't close anymore: now I have feelings and shit.

Jokes aside, I think that this scene works so damn well because it does not go for the cheap drama or the clich dialogue, instead it's the culmination of everything that the anime was leading up to. Tomoya finally came to terms with his loss, and realized that he had become that which he hated the most.

The story of Tomoya's dad and the parallel with his own story, personally, hit very close to home. That's probably what I liked the most about After Story: the conflict seemed real; the character's demons, humane; and the way of pvercoming all that, possible.

Warning for those that had not seen the rest of AS: the tears just wont stop coming. When I marathoned it for the first time, I cried all the way through the end. I had never cried so much in my life. So, good luck, fellows.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been joining the rewatch, because I actually rewatched it a month ago.

But if anyone here is watching for the first time... you probably now understand why this is in my top 2 favorite anime. At times, it's tragic, but the upswings of the emotional roller-coaster are the best scenes.

This episode in particular... it knows how to make a grown man cry. The whole series deals with the fears that people face as they try to start a family, and I think this one is where the theme really kicks in: "You just fucking do your best. That's all you can do."

As a final note, Ushio 10/10 best line of all time, ripped my heart out [(spoiler)](/s "I can cry in the bathroom, and in daddy's arms... Sanae is the best grandma ever for teaching Ushio to love the father that she rarely even sees.")
>> ARTICLE
I rewatched AS like 4 times and this episode still make my cry everytime.
It's insane T-T

HOW?! how do you even, i can't even watch the dramaless harem part without crying. four times? do you revel in depression? :O

This episode is the one that really got me. I cried the first time I watched it, and I cried again now that I rewatched it. An anime moving me to tears isn't common, After Story is really something special. The scene where Ushio cries in Tomoya's arms puts me on the verge of tears, but the one where Tomoya tells Ushio about Nagisa, it's no use trying to hold them back.

It's so much more than just "sad" though, this is an incredibly powerful, well written, masterfully directed episode. It's remarkably memorable and truly worthy of being called a masterpiece.

Everybody talks about this episode but nobody talks about how spot-on the direction is.  The direction is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
The only anime episode where I don't need image, music, or anything else except the memory of watching to bring me to tears. This episode was absolutely fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Its funny, I remeber when I first watched this episode about an hour before church one sunday but I had gotten most of the emotional trauma out of my system before service(Although my eyes were still red and my nose was quite runny).

Or so I thought.

Then, In the middle of the sermon I remembered it all. It was so hard not to just break down right there. But I pulled through. Barely.

Get ready for Episode 19 everybody!!! The feels train will keep moving on!

1. Sci-fi/Somewhat "philosophical"/Humor -- They got it. **Space Dandy, Season 2**
2. Evangelion
3. Welcome to the NHK

Edit: Another clue. Cowboy Bebop has been the best guess so far but not for the reasons you might think.

Edit 2: Yet another clue. This is a series you will all know but isn't typically listed as a favorite of all time. It's not obscure at all. It's also episodic.

Edit 3: I think the "philosophical" part is throwing people off. I would argue it's an extremely philosophical show, but it very nuanced about the way it goes about it.

Edit 4: Clue #3...I think, since the previous edit wasn't really a clue. It has an AMAZING English dub. 

Final Edit: /u/agyscon and /u/Zaggar submitted and got it at pretty much the same time. The answer is **Space Dandy, Season 2.** Thanks for playing.

1. Action/Mystery

2. Death Parade

Start watching subs, because dubs generally have less emotion in their voices, and the japanese VA industry have very talented VAs.
>> ARTICLE
I would like to add that there are exceptions though. There are plenty of really well done dubs. 
>> ARTICLE
Well done dubs are rare. If you go out to actively seek them then of course you will find, but to casually browse the endless supply then you'd be sadly disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Code Geass, FMA:B, Steins;Gate, Death Note, Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop, and even Onepiece all had great dubs.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gates dub will never be better because nothing can beat Kana Hanazawa as Mayuri(or anyone.)
>> ARTICLE
These are Top Tier anime all of which have decent budgets behind them. Being clear cut favorites they are entitled to great dubs as they are the crown gems being presented to western society.
>> ARTICLE
You forgot about Baccano, which has one of the best dubs ever, period.
>> ARTICLE
Just have to add to this list. Panty and Stocking, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (although I preferred the sub), and Black Lagoon also had very good dubs.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder why English voice actors aren't as emotional as Japanese voice actors? Is it because they have to do their best to sync their lips with what's on the screen? Or simply because the dubbing industry does not have nearly as good of voice actors as other industries (from japan's VA industry with animes to VA in the US with typical animated TV shows/movies).
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if it has to do with the process. Maybe the English voice actors don't get to get into their characters, whether due to time or work environment or even just lack of enthusiasm. I sincerely doubt it's due to lack of talent, but I donno what other good reasons there could be.
>> ARTICLE
It's because of culture. My theory is that **language puts you inside a framework of mind**.

Take a example: You see a asian male speaking in perfect American english, the sort you'd expect to see a posh white kid speaking. You encounter dissonance.

Take another example: You listen to the english version of a J-Pop song. It sounds horrifyingly cheesy because you understand what the lyrics are about.

**English speech means an English world.** Anime is designed to engage with Japanese audiences, aligned with mostly Japanese cultural ideals. Voice acting doesn't necessarily make a difference, it just doesn't work. English gets you into the mindset of shows that are set in English, and VA is cringeworthy (I cringed when I was listening to the dubbed video you posted).

**High-pitch voices sound weird**. Also, for some strange reason, dubs tend to elevate the pitch of the dubbers. Girls are glaringly squeaky even and guys sometimes use a higher pitch - something we simply don't associate with 'normal english voice'. 

**We recreate our own perception in subs.** While we can't understand Japanese voice, after a while we become accustomed with the idea of an "anime culture" framework. When listening to original Jap seiyuus, we don the Japanese/Anime culture framework hat. Certain phrases may come to mean things and parsing becomes easier, and the subtitles become less intrusive and oft un-necessary.

Well-done dubs or not, once the anime deviates from shared storytelling parameters, such as **heroism** or **fighting**, and goes into culturally separate **courtship** and **tradition**, a subbed anime will always offer more lifelike characters and less uncanny moments. 

(except for bad subs during climax scenes, erggh.)
>> ARTICLE
You started on quite a high point in my opinion. For the slice of life/romance/drama genres that is. Clannad & Clannad AS were one of my favorite shows I've ever seen. I'm glad you enjoyed them as well, and know that there are many more quality shows out there!

As someone else has said, if you're watching FMA then choosing FMA: Brotherhood **might** be the better option as this one follows the manga whereas FMA has anime-only material from halfway through the show because the manga wasn't finished yet back then.   
Ofcourse, it is completely up to you. I saw FMA first and Brotherhood after that and I enjoyed Brotherhood more as it wrapped up the story better. Seeing both isn't necessary, but I did enjoy the two of them.

You're always welcome to report after FMA(:B)! And if you're wondering what is out there for a next watch you can always go to /r/animesuggestion and let them give you some lists based on "must-watch" value or per genre.
>> ARTICLE
I'm planning on watching both. My sister is pretty big into anime, and has recommended both to me.

Thanks for the link! I've gone through the recommendation wiki linked in the sidebar, but I do prefer talking with people to better decide on things. Much appreciated.
>> ARTICLE
> I've gone through the recommendation wiki linked in the sidebar, but I do prefer talking with people to better decide on things.

Oh yeah, I know that all too well. It's just much more interesting to know why it is recommended to you than to just have a wiki say 'it is a classic'.

I do recommend that you watch at least something from every genre (aside from things that make you feel uneasy). I now know for sure that I'm not a fan of Mecha & Ecchi, however I did discover an unknown love for Sci-Fi (which I previously always discredited because of bad experiences with the genre). Not every genre you liked in acting will give you the same enjoyment in anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually not too picky with genres; I can enjoy things from about any genre, though I do have my preferences, of course. That's why I like talking with people, who can tell me what they liked about X, what it did well, what it didn't, how it compares to Y... stuff like that.
>> ARTICLE
I think he may have been trying to recommend /r/animesuggest, unlike the one he linked, it's a fairly active subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
Noted, thank you!
>> ARTICLE
I watched the show dubbed and enjoyed it, to each their own
>> ARTICLE
Please, don't tell me you watched the show dubbed...

You linked the dubbed version of the Clannad Sunohara x Tomoya video.

>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I did. My sister tells me that animes are generally better with their original voices and with English subs. While I believe her-- I've seen bad examples before-- I'm often multitasking, as I watch on one screen in a dual screen set up, and just like being able to look away from the screen and still know what's being said. But if I'm concentrating on it, I don't mind watching with English subs at all.
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly why I usually watch dubs too. It's nice to be able to not have to focus in on just watching the show to understand what they're saying (although I can wach subs just fine too). And in the end, the Clannad dub really grew on me, and I came to love it. No shame in watching dubs over subs, some people just like to hear things in their spoken language. Just watch whatever you prefer.
>> ARTICLE
Often multitasking means you're not paying attention at all to something that deserves your full attention. As someone so "against" crying throughout your post I have a feeling you have a HUGE barrier up to this anime. I'm a thirty year old man and I've cried more for anime than any American TV show I've ever watched.
>> ARTICLE
True, it often does. But it doesn't detract from my attention. I have issues concentrating on things in general, so having something else to look at during the average dialog-driven scene is good for me. On the occasion I do think I missed something, I simply take it back a moment. Doesn't ruin it for me at all.

As for having a barrier up to Clannad, that's simply not true. It's not that I'm against crying, I just... didn't.
>> ARTICLE
The one thing that the dub has is what I feel is the perfect voice actor for Akio.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm often multitasking, as I watch on one screen in a dual screen set up

[...](http://i.imgur.com/TX9Z3eU.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
lol If I'm watching something, and that's my primary focus, then I'm probably just browsing Reddit or something unimportant. I like to pay attention to details, so I don't distract myself to the point of missing things.
>> ARTICLE
Key's works are based on visual novel, and the anime adaptation of Clannad was crafted with the same immersion aspect in mind. 
You certainly won't get the same impact from a Key work if you're multitasking while watching, rather than intently focusing as the OST pierces you with each scene. 

But yeah, the Clannad dub is especially terrible on top of this, and the voice actors plainly don't seem to give a fuck compared to the original case sadly. You definitely didn't get the most out of the series due to these factors.
>> ARTICLE
I generally stay away from the sub vs dub argument, because I find it not to be worth arguing, but the Clannad dub really is bad. Names are pronounced incorrectly, voice actors aren't nearly as good, and the feeling is kinda lost.

I prefer subs, but I'd wouldn't bat an eye if someone says they preferred dubs...unless you're talking about Clannad. People like Akio just don't come across nearly as awesome without the Japanese voice actor. His voice actor make a great character into one of my favorite characters EVER.
>> ARTICLE
I don't like dubs, not because they are dubs, but because they're almost always done horribly.

That's really the only gripe I think most people have with them.

The only show I can think of with good dubs is DBZ
>> ARTICLE
Clannad dub was one of the best i've seen. Except for a certain characters that have boyish voices for girls, Tomoyo's dub actor makes up for it.

ughh, i cried after this review when you mentioned that hard hitting (don't wanna spoil it) arc.  imma go watch this series again now.  thanks man
>> ARTICLE
You're a better man (woman?) than I. As much as I loved this series, I donno if I could watch it again. Maybe farther down the line.
>> ARTICLE
lol, (man).  but yea, more power to you!  i'm just glad you like anime!
>> ARTICLE
Cheers!
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised that someone new to anime would be able to tolerate a highschool romance/SoL as their first thing.

I never really got around to watching Clannad and probably won't for a long time despite it's genre fitting what I watch in general.

Try the following which are generally regarded as some of the best story-telling shows there are:
- FMA: Brotherhood
- Puella Magi Madoka Magica
- Shinsekai Yori
- Fate/Zero
- Steins;Gate
>> ARTICLE
I do love a good story. Thanks for the recommendations!
>> ARTICLE
After story made me feel depressed for a couple of days.

Not sure if that's what happened with other people who watched it.

Maybe it's because I despised all of High School as well
>> ARTICLE
After story made you happy actually, cause sensory abstration layer. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch Little Busters! and Kanon.

You clearly can see how Key's VN works are (and their adaptations). They are all quite similiar. Little Busters!, the Refrain story in particular is great.
>> ARTICLE
I'll check 'em out. Thanks for the recommendations, mate!
>> ARTICLE
Oh and go with the Kanon (2006) version. Not the old one
>> ARTICLE
I still haven't finished it myself. I'm going to have to restart it, as well, because I've forgotten a couple of things. Out of curiosity, what else have you watched? Or was this your first? 
>> ARTICLE
~~I've seen random episodes of random animes on TV every now and then, but this one was the first I've sat down and watched through.~~

EDIT: Actually, I lied. I looked up and watched through Mobile Suit Gundam Wing a few years ago. Totally forgot about that.
>> ARTICLE
Enjoy Gundam Wing? If so you should definitely look into the other Gundam titles available. 
>> ARTICLE
I remembered thinking it was awesome when I saw it on Cartoon Network way back when, so I checked it out. I don't remember a whole lot of specifics by now (as is evident by my forgetting I even watched it). Perhaps it warrants another watch. But I remember that I did enjoy it.

I've never seen any of the other Gundam titles. I'll look into them, though. Any particular recommendations?
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people will recommend 08th MS Team as do I, as well as War in the Pocket, the original (Mobile Suit Gundam 0079), Zeta and 00 (season 1 specifically). I'm still working on Stardust Memory, but I'll suggest that as well, if you find 08th MS Team tickles your fancy. 
>> ARTICLE
If you're going to watch FMA, Be sure to watch Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, that series follows the manga.  
>> ARTICLE
*spoilers* You shouldn't be on this thread if you haven't seen this amazing anime.

The thing that pissed me off was that I made the fucking mistake of googling the anime. Nevertheless I still cried buckets. The whole orbs thing was pretty weird for me. Didn't ruin the anime just didn't think it was necessary and was kind of annoying later on. I was expecting her to die and i still cried. This anime makes me tear up when I hear the ost.

DAE find the Ushio ark the most sad? I cried so much on episode 18. It was Tomoyo's daughter for christ sake. The fact he distanced himself away from her. Wishing she was never born because Nagisa died during childbirth. The character development in those few episodes is remarkable. At the beginning of the ark (ep 17) i didn't know who she was and didn't care for her but then in ep 18 Tomoyo talking about his father and realising he was horrible to ushio nad they both cry. 

WHY DID I WATCH THIS ANIME. THE FEELS ARE TOO STRONG I DONT RECOMMEND THIS ANIME EVER IT WILL 
KILL YOU!!!!

EDIT: Here is what I'm talking about http://youtu.be/s7CaEoX2XJ0  I think whichever version you watched (sub or dub) in the first season is what makes you used to the voices and makes it stronger impact if it makes sense. I now realise how bad the dub is on certain characters but because i've gotten used to it, it makes it much more sad. Im blabbing on sorry.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda felt exactly the same way when *that* happened. No tears, just a great sense of loss.

Also, I suspect not many people mention the fact that it is one of the funnier animes out there what with sunohara's antics, because the sadder moments tend ti stick with you more.
>> ARTICLE
I see someone recommended watching FMA: Brotherhood instead of FMA.  I suggest you watch FMA *then* watch FMA: Brotherhood.  The original caught up to the manga and then diverged onto its own story line while Brotherhood followed the manga.  They are both really good (don't listen to the people that say the original wasn't good; it is) and, while I think Brotherhood was overall better, the original does a better job of fleshing out a lot of the characters than Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
I hear both FMA and Brotherhood have their strong and weak points, at least compared to each other. I plan on watching both.
>> ARTICLE
Watching both is the best way to go about it. Also the dub is really well done. 
>> ARTICLE
I want to watch this anime so bad, but the eyes creep me out...
>> ARTICLE
That did take a bit of getting used to. Please, don't let that keep you away! You won't regret it!

The ending of Railgun S episode 5 and the begining of episode 6 are what I would say are my favorite moments in any media.

But, this bit in particular: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fi5e5toMFg

That entire arc is amazing. So much better than the Index version of it.

I think the entire series is better than Index. (or atleast for now)

The last 2 episodes of The Tatami Galaxy
>> ARTICLE
Such an underrated show. Or rather under the radar. Good pick
>> ARTICLE
episode 12 of Trigun "Diablo." makes you realize how great a character Vash is.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 17: Prior to this point, it is pretty clear that the story isn't set on earth, and "lost technology" is hinted, along with the fact that Vash probably isn't a normal person... But the way this episode jumps back in time to the SEEDS ships really amazed me.  We abruptly understand that Knives tried to destroy all of the humans, and it was only through Rem's sacrifice that any survived at all, yet despite this, humanity finds itself on a world that is by no means well-suited for humanity's existence.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 10 of Puella Magi Madoka Magica was just mind-blowing in how it made me rethink the context of so much that had happened before.  It's probably my favorite single episode of any anime.
>> ARTICLE
This was what I was going to post.
>> ARTICLE
Is it really that great or was it blown up by the communities? I'm on episode 4 or something close, and I can't seem to be excited enough to continue.
>> ARTICLE
It's really that great, in my opinion.  I gave up after 3 episodes the first time I watched it with a friend telling me how amazing it was.  Some time later, I gave it another try and watched it all the way through, and now it's my favorite of all time.
>> ARTICLE
[Implying episode 9 did not make Madoka Magica a 10/10]

You sir, are craaaazy.
>> ARTICLE
is it dubbed? my friend told me to watch it and i only watched the first episode.

i wanted to finish up some other stuff before i got into a subbed anime
>> ARTICLE
IMHO the dubs are fine.
>> ARTICLE
It is dubbed but the dub isn't very good
>> ARTICLE
Yes its dubbed. For a normal anime the dub is actually pretty good, but its generally recommended that you watch it subbed simply because all the Japanese VAs did an absolutely amazing job bringing their characters to life. You don't miss anything in the dub tho and some of the performances are actually pretty good (that English VA for Kyubey had quite the standout performance).

Personal Preference tho, I suggest trying out both if you are unsure about subtitles. Its quite a good show, so pick your preference and stick with it.
>> ARTICLE
i prefer dubs. i would never watch a dub of a live action movie but for cartoons all it means is a different voice actor 

and i have watched subbed before but only for things that are un dubbed
>> ARTICLE
Having watched both I have to say once more: Japanese voice actors can just cry better.

In shows like Clannad and Madoka Magica this makes a difference in how you feel along with the characters.

It is still a very good dub, but do know you are missing quite a bit of the experience.
>> ARTICLE
well that is unavoidable unless i learn japanese
>> ARTICLE
....


There are these things like subtitles you know

....


And you might say "but if you don't understand it, how do you get the better impression ?"

I think language conveys besides the words also the emotional baggage, which you can grasp without understanding the language. And to me English VA's in general have worse acting in this aspect. The words are there, the feelings often not so much.

And I don't want to be some sub elitist here, but that counter argument really wasn't one imho.
>> ARTICLE
im an uncultured swine :P
>> ARTICLE
I was gunna say episode 3 when shit gets real.
>> ARTICLE
The entirety  of Madoka was spoiled by my friends before I watched it, but as soon as I saw episode 10, I knew that it would have been one of the greatest episodes I'd ever seen if it hadn't been spoiled beforehand. 

After that, I became even more careful about avoiding spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
*Rewatching* episode 1 did it for me. It makes the cascade from episode 10 so much better.
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree. The range of emotions in that episode invokes so much feels in me. Chiwa Saito's voice acting was beyond phenomenal. During the month long gap between episode 10 and 11/12, I must have watched 10 about 10 times.
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't agree more.

IMO, in any [Madoka](/s "anime involving time travel, the episode where they reveal the time travelling and/or the paradoxes and how the events all link together are always the best episodes.")
>> ARTICLE
As long as it's well done, mind you. There's nothing I hate more than seeing a good story or mysterious plot device ruined by sloppy execution of that sort of thing. 
>> ARTICLE
I fucking cried. I was just bawling at the end. The show was already a 10/10 but that ep pushed it to a level I could have never imagined. It messed with my head and my heart. A beautiful anime overall. 
>> ARTICLE
I marathoned Madoka on December 23, 2011 and couldn't bring myself to tell anyone why I seemed so depressed for the holidays. Worth it, though.

Christ I hope the third movie delivers.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I too am in the "I watched the whole of Madoka on one day" club.

I just couldnt stop anymore after Ep3. It was such a rollercoaster of emotions. And by the end I was broken.

I recently rewatched the dub together with my GF, she was stunned as well, but she doesnt know if she really liked the ending. However the second time viewing it had in my opinion even more impact on me.

Every interaction between [Homura and Madoka]( /spoiler ) really pulled my heartstrings.
>> ARTICLE
This. My heart was dropping that entire episode as I realized what was happening. That sick feeling that just washes over you as you understand exactly what this show is about. I get cold chills everytime I think about it. I never even saw it coming.

EDIT: Also I know most of you probably watched Madoka after it already aired, but let me tell you, episode 3 was so fucking unexpected. There was no warning from the director that this was ANYTHING other than a mahou shoujo anime like sailor moon. I wish I could have screenshot-ed r/anime's front page that morning. and 4chan. and everywhere. [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=xYtMNFTt-Y0) was posted in the week after that episode aired. It was fucking monumental. Like these days, if you watch madoka, you at least have SOME inkling that its not just a magical girl anime. People back then didnt, it was completely unexpected.
>> ARTICLE
[Here](http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Threads) is a link to all the /a/ Madoka threads. 
>> ARTICLE
> If you want to make sadistic bloody anime why don't just go and make "Saya no Uta" into anime!!!

My sides, I really couldnt hold it after this.

Edit: I do have to say however that the opening sequence does set the tone really. With it's gritty dark visuals. I knew from the start this was no happy happy go lucky show.
>> ARTICLE
I really wish that everybody had a chance to watch Madoka from the start, just like we did.

It really hit you like a punch to the gut when it happened. Because it's not supposed to happen like that. Magical girls don't die in an ambush. They sacrifice themselves for the greater good, and save everyone else by doing so. They don't get blindsided and torn apart.

Not like that.
>> ARTICLE
And then you rewatch episode 1 and you see ALL THE SIGNS and it makes it that more painful to watch.

Even after having re-watched Madoka Magica many, **many** times, I still tear up during the scene where [Major Spoilers!](/s "Homura promises to save Madoka from becoming a Magical Girl, and then tearfully kills her.")

This is the best example of what OP is talking about, if you ask me. Not only is episode 10 phenomenal, and a great example of a heck of a lot of great storytelling and character development compressed into a very short time, but it also retroactively makes earlier episodes, especially episode 1, even better by re-contextualizing the events of those episodes in a new light.

I just remember his sister fighting those 2 ninjas and then  it just talked about the fight in the gif too. Maybe the fight actually happened in the re-aired version or something because I know that they re-aired the show but I figured it was just exactly the same.

That .gif is from the preceding episode's "preview." The fight was never actually shown in the episode itself.

This is a very old troll joke about the show. They preview the fight but you never see it and they never even really talk about why they murder the guy.

Can't remember which episode it was, but [Fate/Zero](/s "The episode where Lancer is forced to kill himself. The epic fight between Saber and Lancer is cut short by his forced suicide, and the entire fallout afterwards was insane. As messed up as it was, it brought the show into 10/10 territory for me. 'Discussing the Grail' was a big one as well.")

The last few episodes of Welcome to the NHK when you find out what has really been going on. I'm not sure I would actually give this anime a 10/10, but those last few episodes drastically improved my perception of the series so I thought I would include it.

Obligatory episode 12 of Steins;Gate. It throws an already great show into overdrive, and it doesn't slow down until the conclusion.

FMA Brotherhood. Lust vs Mustang. From that point on I knew the show was going to be a 10/10.

Lastly, the episodes of Samurai Champloo that cover Mugen's past. The ending gives me chills every time ("KILL ME!").
>> ARTICLE
I love that scene in Samurai Champloo where [](/s "Mugen starts to go to the afterlife, but is like "No I'm not done yet." ")

Episode 82 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes

What a masterpiece of an episode, the nerve-wrecking tension throughout the episode had me on the edge of my seat for most of it, and god damn that ending. Possibly one of the most depressing but powerful moments in anime history. The final scene just feels so real, no music at all, just the low hum of the spaceship and then that end card with the narrator. I think I just sat there for a solid 10 minutes staring at the screen after it ended, in such disbelief that I couldn't even feel sad right away. A masterful episode in an amazing series.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 18 of [Neon Genesis Evangelion](/s "Uptil that point, it was a very solid 9 in my eyes, but when Eva 01 was forced away from Shinji's control by the Dummy Plug and forced to fight Eva 03 with Toji in it.... That scene, the voice acting, the way it was portrayed. Meant the show officially entered in to the 10/10 Category for me") From that point onwards, everything the show does exceeds and goes far beyond what is necessary to even receive a 10/10 for me, but episode 18 was the one in which it crossed the line.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I also thought the scene was handled very well in Rebuild. I know some people thought that the children's choir was silly, but for me it made the scene that much more disturbing.
>> ARTICLE
I love the choir. Cognitive dissonance all up in this bitch.
>> ARTICLE
It was even more disturbing for me because I had watched the finale or final episodes of Sakurasou no pet na Kanojo where they played THAT SAME EXACT SONG and I watched EVA 2.22 that same day. That was a tad traumatizing having 2 completely opposite feelings for one song on the same day...
>> ARTICLE
Standing bloodied over the remains, stomach swollen (at least it looked like it), Shinji screaming, a rainbow overhead as the song comes to a calming end. DAMN.

the way we see the dummy take over in rebuild just sends shivers up my spine, shinji's hands locked in place, forced to do... that, it's amazing and horrifying

Episode 25 of Code Geass R2. The bar for what I consider a perfect ending has been set unreasonably high by this one show. I know it's worse than s1 in most ways, but that ending was just so amazing I would be lying to myself about how much I enjoyed it if I gave it any less.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain to me how R2 was worse than S1? I found that I enjoyed it WAY more than S1. 
>> ARTICLE
It went from a strategic game of rebellion with an awesome ability to full-on super robot action. I thought R2 was in general, better, but I missed the mind games. 
>> ARTICLE
The plot trainwrecked into random twists every episode, battles became less about strategy so much as who had the newest Knightmare, etc. Also Rolo. Fucking Rolo.
>> ARTICLE
I loved Rolo... But I do agree about the battles devolving into the "newest Knightmare" vs. true strategy. I just found R2 MUCH more emotionally compelling, if not intellectually so. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they also really rushed a lot of events. I would have preferred a longer build up as he gradually knocked off all opponents in an unrelenting rise to absolute power.
>> ARTICLE
It was also interesting to see a different kind of Yandere than we're used to.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't have minded the new R2 Knightmares if the jump in technology was believable and not suspension-of-disbelief breaking.

They basically went from Votoms level tech to Gundam SEED level tech in a scant few years.

Well the technology was there even in the first season, they just didn't apply it to knightmares.

[Episode 5 of Cowboy Bebop for this scene alone.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLkQikmSrA)
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing, though.  For many shows, the music is important, but still largely incidental.  For Cowboy Bebop, the music was intended to be every bit as much a part of the experience as the dialogue.  It's even in the show's name, not to mention all but two or three episode names are references to different musical genres or terms ("Cowboy Funk", "Jupiter Jazz", "Waltz for Venus") or specific songs ("Toys in the Attic", "Bohemian Rhapsody").  It was a very carefully composed score drawing from a plethora of styles and cultures to reflect the hodge-podge nature of Bebop setting.

What I'm getting at, I suppose, is that saying Bebop without its musical score wouldn't be as good is kind of missing the point.  Cowboy Bebop without the Seatbelts, Steve Conte, Mai Yamane, and all the rest just wouldn't be Bebop.
>> ARTICLE
I think you could say that about a lot of shows though, not just Bebop. I would say Spirited Away is one of my favorite movies of all time, but without Joe Hisaishi as the composer of its musical score, who knows how different my perception of the movie would be?

Music is such a big part of Bebop.

 I can't imagine that show with any other score.

A friend had shown me the episodes "Mushroom Samba" and "Pierrot le Fou" a few years prior to me actually sitting down and watching Cowboy Bebop properly.  I'd been impressed by those episodes, but took a long time to make time for the whole series.  It only took until I got to the climax of the very first episode ([Spoilers, the scene I'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR56Rvm1f_w#t=8m32s)), where I said aloud to myself, "I love this show."  Everything about that scene was just beautiful.  The music, the imagery, the long silence before "Adios..."  I have a soft spot for noir, and it hit all the right cords.

When I was about 14 (now 21), I learned of "anime" from the interwebs when someone showed me a 30 second clip of a Chobits scene that made me cackle and grasp at my sides for a good 10 minutes after replaying it over and over. 

The person that gave me this clip then told me to watch the anime that was on Cartoon Network during it's saturday night line-up. When I flipped the TV on, this exact scene was showing. At that moment, I was awakened to a whole new form of entertainment, that of which nothing could ever compare.

thats episode 5? I thought that was the finale, man have I been watching them all out of order?

man. . . . . . .I can't even pick one.


there was a moment that made me yell "fuck i love this show" almost every other episode.

 This episode, mushroom samba, pierrot le fou, cowboy funk, brain scratch. . .hell, the last four episodes in general.
>> ARTICLE
I wish there was a film adaptation or perhaps a miniseries of Bebop that strung together just the five core episodes.   Sure, some of the standalone episodes were individually quite good and had a lot of depth.  But the five Vicious/Spike episodes were just on a whole other level.

There is just so much to say about this show - this scene in particular - but I will just say this: every time I watch this episode it's like I'm rewatching it for the first time again. Each time I watch this episode it's still just as beautiful, the dialogue is just as tense, the songs are just as emotional, and the scene is just as amazing.

Just rewatched that clip. All kinds of feelings came rushing back. I remember why I said this was my favorite anime.

That was the first I had ever seen of Cowboy Bebop, and I immediately knew I had seen something amazing.  That scene is among the most incredible I have ever seen.  Bebop would have been a 10/10 already, but that episode, and scene, just blows everything out of the water.

I came here assuming this would be the episode people picked for TTGL. I wasn't disappointed. Simon's crowning moment of awesome is my favorite single scene from the entire show.

I was surprised TTGL wasn't on here already.  I'm also glad I'm not being hounded by people telling me I should have picked you-know-which episode.

I only got to episode 3-4, but it never really appealed to me. Now I hear about Kill La Kill from the ACCLAIMED Tengen. Should I REALLY check it out again? 
>> ARTICLE
For all it's acclaim, Gurren Lagann is one of those shows that takes a while to get really good.  I recommend giving it another chance, but stick with it a bit longer.  If the show doesn't hook you before episode 12, you can safely declare it not for you.  Don't let the big number scare you; you should be hooked sooner rather than later!
>> ARTICLE
Keep going. The entire thing about Gurren Lagann is that in the beginning its purposely trying to bore you, so that when it takes off and doesn't stop, you won't see it coming.

In many ways it literally is a roller coaster ride. Episode six is when you hit the top of the giant climb, and then seven is the drop.

For me it really got going from ep 6 or 7.

You stopped before the first hook, not even episode 11 either. Once it hit's it's main stride, it's a roller-coaster.

Interesting. I only watched this show up to episode 11 and then dropped it.

This is spot on, the hardest part was the shonen wide-eyed yelling. It's a small trivial thing to concede to, that and the huge nude titans. My younger brother swears by it though, so I keep trying to get into.

I just don't know what shows your watching where you see Attack on Titan and go, "You know, I like anime and all, but I think my time would be better spent watching something else."
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes it's not quite that, it's just a particular characteristic of a show that irks the viewer. Like Gatchaman Crowds. I've seen the first two episodes, but am reticent to start the third to complete the three episode test because I can't stand the protagonist.

AoT has its faults, like any show does. They may not bug you, but they might bug other people. To each their own.

Well, no show can appeal to everyone.  When I recommend this show to people, IRL or on /r/animesuggest, I usually give the disclaimer that it takes a while to get really good, and if they aren't hooked after episode 11, they can safely drop it.

Episode 12 of Bakemonogatari. [Here is an old write-up I did on the subject (Warning: Spoilers)](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1cz2jw/anime_club_watch_2_bakemonogatari_1115_tsubasa/c9ldgnz).

Funny how that thread discussing episodes 11-15 of Bakemonogatari was mostly people praising episode 12, even though the rest of the episodes are pretty amazing, too.

I'll quote /u/Hecatonchair:

I loved this episode because of how much it revealed about her character.

I think FMA had much better side stories and deviations, which I loved.

They even had an entire episode dedicated to Lust, a homunculus. It has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot, but it added a lot to her character.

FMAB is like *all* plot. Although this can be considered a strength, I personally don't mind when series, especially shounens, take a little different route.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, in the first FMA they put a muuuuuch larger emphasis on that plotline and built it up a lot more. They allowed you to fall more in love with those couple characters whereas in FMA:B they kinda assume you've seen FMA so they don't go into nearly as much detail. It's enough detail to understand how that event makes the Elrics grow but doesn't indulge you quite the same.

It's one of those scenes that, IMO, is better in the anime. It was the moment that I realized how good the voice acting was and that I was going to stick with the anime no matter what. I don't care if its slower or has worse pacing, it's worth the wait.

**Kino no Tabi episode 2**

The episode is just really really great and hammers the theme in an elegant and understated manner. It's an episode with very little action, extremely slow pacing, and I find it brilliant because everything in it enhances the theme and atmosphere - especially the slowness.


**Psycho-Pass episode 11**

[spoiler](/s "When Akane finally confronts Makishima and the show really hammers in the question of whether the current system is good.") This is just a perfect culmination of the theme being developed by the show and allows the plot to shoot forward in many different ways. The villain also becomes real at this point, being more than just an ominous figure.

**Katanagatari episode 12 (final)**

The ending was a full completion of the show. It was able to wrap up all of the relevant plot threads in an elegant fashion. The episode was focused and understated while still completely developing the themes and ideas presented throughout the anime. It's one of the best endings I remember watching.

**Tsubasa: Resevoir Chronicle - Tokyo Revelations OVA**

This is where the heavily arc-based show brings together the loose plot threads and forms the central narrative. This changes the show from an adventure of the week show into the colossal mindfuckery that  the plot actually is. It's the first hint of things being very different than presented, and does so in a very cool way that also moves the characters forward dramatically. 

It's a bit of a cheat, since the show never actually gets past this, but the episodes are still amazing without the followup and the manga continues on.

Apparently most /r/anime dwellers are very new to anime...
>> ARTICLE
Well being new doesn't mean you don't have any standards an can't determine whether the show has anything going on for it or not. 

Also "animes"? 
>> ARTICLE
No, it just means you have watched a very small amount of them (generally the mainstream ones), and don't have a huge list from which to cherry-pick the best ones.
>> ARTICLE
In general, anime is pretty new and actually shitty medium, mostly centered around otaku culture and most of the shows have terrible writing. So having a lot of titles generally means you watched tons of crap and can appreciate good ones more, but doesn't necessarily grant you the knowledge of what's the best. I've seen people with 500+ titles having mirai nikki and k-on as their top anime with 10/10 score. Granted the scoring system is very flawed and usually works as "I liked it so it's good, 10/10".

I've seen like 150~ titles only, but I try to pick what I watch carefully so I don't waste my time much and this is probably the first season when I watch all the shows while they airing and not waiting to marathon the whole thing. And I can say that I watch pretty good shows most of the time. 
>> ARTICLE
>In general, anime is pretty new and actually shitty medium, mostly centered around otaku culture and most of the shows have terrible writing.

It's not new, not even close, it's not a shitty medium (even though it's sometimes used improperly), and while it is true that there are a lot of shows focusing on otaku, there are also many more appealing to a wider audience.

Terrible writing depends on the anime. It really isn't a rule...
>> ARTICLE
It is relatively new. Even if we count the early animation in 20s the start of anime, it's still quite new. And it's a medium with potential but it's not used most of the time so that's why I am saying it's a shitty medium, at least right now. Main audience in Japan is otaku, because they actually buy their anime. While I might be using the term loosely, it's still true that most of the shows have something to appeal to them just to sell. 

Now about the writing, compare your best anime to the best books. In my opinion books win by quite a bit. And of course, the comparison might not look fair considering the well established reading, but that's what anime has to compete with. 
>> ARTICLE
That's really an unfair comparison. Anime is an audiovideo experience and, as such, it can really only be compared with other such media (like movies, cg stuff, western cartoons, tv shows and so on). Honestly, compared to books any other media (except music) is an infant, so comparing them is terribly unfair.
>> ARTICLE
And yet they compete in storytelling and writing and some of the shows are based on books. Anime has potential to be really something that can't be replicated in any other medium since it doesn't have the restraints of having to limit everything only to written story, doesn't have the downsides the live action brings and can do something marvelous with the visuals and some of the shows are doing that quite well, but there is still room to improve. And of course there is the fact that anime could combine music, visuals, storytelling and give us something amazing that we wouldn't be able to find anywhere else. That's why I am saying that there is potential, which isn't yet unveiled until someone really smart gives it his all and makes a gamechanging anime which will blow everyone's minds. I am still hoping it will happen some day, because I like anime, but right now the creators have to do a lot of tail twisting to fit into quite small budget, to appeal to the existing fans to sell at least enough to give them enough money for salaries and even then anime is pretty limited to Japan which is while advanced in technology, still falls behind on a lot of social issues (like the position women are in, healthcare) and that reflects in anime a lot. Also there is only so much that can come out of one nation and they have to compete with the whole world.

>> ARTICLE
I only have 3 shows that I have a 10/10 on.

I hugely enjoyed Mirai Nikki so I gave it a 10/10. The last 3 episodes in particular were what turned it from a very enjoyable survival game series into what is to me unarguably the best survival game story to date. And yes, I've read all Hunger Games books before anyone says anything about that (in fact that's a part of what inspired me to watch this show). I can't really talk about it though without ruining pretty much the whole show, so I'll leave it at that. It's not going to be a 10/10 for all too many people, but I am infatuated with the show.

Clannad/After Story had several moments that made me rate this show a 10/10. Of course, Episode 18 of After Story is pretty much legendary and resonated with a ton of people. The Snowy Walk episode that also exists in After Story, along with Kotomi's Suitcase in the first season were absolutely incredible and had a huge impact on me.

Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood was the only other series that I rated 10/10. It's just an adventure story that does so many things so well, I can't really put my finger on any one thing in particular. Some of the more memorable scenes were Mustang against Lust, and the Armstrong siblings vs Sloth as far as fight scenes were concerned. But the whole cast was incredible and memorable as far as that is concerned, and the plot is thick with discovery and high stakes as adventure stories should be.

Brotherhood will always be 10/10. Respect.

Kamisama no Memochou's last episode.

Gintama - The Final episode of the 4 Deva's arc. That scene with Jirochou and Pirako makes me cry all the time. This episode just shows how brilliant Sorachi Hideaki really is when it comes to writing.

The recent ep. of Shingeki no Kyojin. I never knew the series could make me feel that way :(

Clannad - at first I was skeptical on how people why loved clannad so much, and I thought the series was just funny, but after watching the final episode of Fuuko's arc(?), I just got hooked.


[The final speech] (/s "of Rider") in Fate/Zero. (put a spoiler in since people might find out who died and gave the final speech)

Aku no Hana episode 7. The classroom scene. One of the very few times I've actually gotten chills watching anime.

**Episode 1 of Shingeki No Kyojin/Attack on Titan.** Before you scoff, let me explain a bit... the first time I heard about it during one of those season lineups thread in this subreddit, I didn't interest me, and it sounded almost dull (at the time). Even when someone else urged me to watch it with them, I was very, very reluctant to watch it. I can usually tell if an anime will bore me to tears and I wasn't really into *most* military-type show.    

But I was glad I sat through watching it, because boy I was wrong about it. When those Titans showed up, the show had its hands on me. I was instantly curious on what the heck the Titans are, was kept wondering what will happen to the main characters, pondering about the Titans' origins, and so forth. I haven't had an *action* anime hook me in so fast in its first episode in a very long time.. usually it would take about one or three for me to get glued to its story.    

Do I think it's still a 10/10 anime after seeing more of it now? It has its ups and downs, but I gotta hand it in to both the manga author and the anime makers for an incredible first episode that made me do a complete 360 from disinterest to avid anime AND manga reader of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 10 of **Sword Art Online**. The anime has many faults, but that episode sticks with me because Kirito is literally the ONLY shounen protagonist to actually [man up and] (/s "not only kiss his romantic interest, but proceed to bed her and then fucking propose! All without stupid tsun tactics and blushing.") I was so shocked I almost died. I never expected that level of romantic depth from a shounen anime. 

99% of action oriented anime never show romance past a single kiss or confession, unless its ecchi or something. SAO broke all my expectations, so even if its not a 10/10 in everyone's book, it is in mine.

edit: downvotes for an opinion that perfectly answers the prompt? Thanks dudes.

So a relationship between adopted siblings is considered incest? I always thought that they had to be parent/child or actual siblings.

Aren't they cousins? But Kirito thinks they're siblings.

He knew since he was 10 that they weren't siblings, he's 16 when he beats SAO.

They are cousins but the US is one of the few places where people seem to care about that. It's not rare for cousins to marry each other around most of the world.
>> ARTICLE
It is when your adopted sister is your cousin.

It's not necessarily incest biologically, but psychologically it is still very much incest.

It's also incest biologically in this case because they're closely related enough (cousins) that it actually does have adverse affects on offspring.

They were still cousins but its legal in Japan anyways...
>> ARTICLE
And that is relevant how? I literally just said its my opinion and that the show has many flaws, but that I think it deserves a 10/10 for that episode. I like the anime, so dont fucking watch it if it offends you, and dont rate it 10/10 if you dont think its worth it. Simple.

I can respect that.  SAO was far too disappointing to me to rate any higher than a 5 or 6, but I loved how and more importantly when they handled the romantic resolution.  Holding back that all until the last episode, (almost) every time...it's my biggest pet peeve in anime.  It's probably the one thing the show did right.

I... Really disagree with you. There was no depth to that romance. Kirito was an ass for the whole show, Asuna adored him even though they barely had enough interaction that I could believe they were even friends, and then they suddenly got married.
It came across as your typical shonen romance: the fantasy of the young guy not having to do anything and having the girl all over him.

>Asuna adored him even though they barely had enough interaction that

[spoiler](/s "no, not at first she didn't. She wasn't very trusting of him at first, then started to dislike him for a while, then eventually she turned to like him because of how caring/nice he was to people. Kirito wasn't a dick to everyone. He was intentionally staying farther from people so he didn't have to see people die again like he did before.

Not to mention they were able to find some solace and a close companion in the game despite being trapped inside.")

Episode 5 from Bartender. I love that show after I picked it up from a reddit-thread here. Classy, well-made and the artstyle is amazing. However, I can see why people would not like it as it doesn't really hold a storyline. But I've never felt more relaxed watching an anime before.
>> ARTICLE
The one and only episode of Pale Cocoon.  
It could have been a good 24-26 episodes just based on what's in those 25 minutes. But its just. One. Episode.  
Only show I've ever given a 10/10 to.

I can't honestly say 10/10...But the last episode of Golden Boy was very rewarding.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really rate anything 10/10, so I'll go in the "considerably beneficial to my opinion of the anime" category.

Episode 9 of "Tamako Market" has probably given me more feels than any other episode of any anime I've ever seen.


Episode 8 of "The iDOLM@STER" basically made me actually start liking the show, so I had more of a reason to watch it than "just because". I ended up becoming a huge iM@S fan, and the rest is history.


"Sengoku Collection" episodes 7, 18, and 25 really stood out to me.  
Overall, I found 7 really heartwarming.  
For 18, you just have to watch it, which you can do without seeing the rest of the show. I recommend checking it out.  
Episode 25 had virtually the exact same plot as a story I wrote in high school for English class. The funny thing is that I didn't even know what message I was trying to send when I wrote that story, but when I watched that episode all that time later, I was just so amazed that I was watching my story as an entire anime episode, and I finally started to understand the message. 

Maybe the story wasn't original and I had just heard/seen it somewhere else before, but I don't remember where it could have been.

School Days. You know what episode it is!

It seems to get a lot of hate, but honestly that show is probably the most I've felt an emotional connection to any anime.

Rarely, if ever, does one episode of an anime completely reshape my opinion of a series.  No one episode can excuse the failures of the ones that came before it.  There are no excuses for bad writing.

That being said though, speaking from a noncritical standpoint, there are certainly anime that didn't 'click' with me until certain episodes.  Bakemonogatari is an excellent example of this.  I respected the series for its artistry and prose, I just didn't enjoy it very much, it was a bit too offbeat for me.  Then episode 12 happened and what before were extreme feelings of discomfort and "let me just finish this so I can slap an 8/10 and be done with it" became the burning passion I have for the series now.

The last episode of Vividred Operation. Never has friendship prevailed so valiantly.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people dislike the show because they think it's stupid, childish, etc., but I liked it a lot because it accomplished its goals. It wasn't supposed to be about the plot or the angst. It was supposed to be a fun and bright show about the power of friendship, and it was definitely strong in that category. It's like TTGL in that it didn't take itself too seriously. I like this scene from the last episode where [](/s "the main character(s) punch a god in the eyeball"). Here's a link to that scene, which demonstrates the nature of the show:

The final episode of the OVA of [Wolf's Rain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwvQ6Hs7tJE). The show was fantastic in every way, but damn, that last episode was apsolutely beautiful. That episode really fucked me up in a good way, so many emotions.

I really only have 3 anime I've ever given 10/10, one of them being a movie, but this episode is by far my favorite episode of all time, and definately made Wolf's Rain deserve it's 10/10.

I don't know about specifics for many episodes since I hardly remember even weeks later what happened in any specific number. But most recently Shingeki got bumped up to a 10 for me with episode 21. Between the music and everything that happened, just. Damn.

Second episode of Escaflowne.  I was blown away by the first episode and the second one sealed the deal.  I had to pause the show, call a friend and tell him to come over and watch it.  I think we finished half of the show in one sitting.

For me it was About half way through Battle of Trost in Attack on Titan. The show was decent for me but when that happened i was floored. I caught up in one night because of that.

Well.. pretty late to the thread but regardless, for me its always that sole Yui episode in Angel Beats.

Last episode of Code Geass. I cried like a little bitch.

Hmm, I love a lot of anime. I can't really say a series is 10/10 when it isn't finished, since Bleach started off strong and then became awful, though I heard the manga was better. So here's my list.

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann - The last episode. For me having an anime have a strong ending and good story throughout really matters a lot. I can't say how many times I cried, but the last few episodes were so amazing they sent chills down my spine.

I agree no show is perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not a 10/10...

Not if you rate based on how much you like it.

The criteria for how much one "likes" something varies greatly from person to person, it's kind of the point of collective ratings and reviews.

I agree, I think no show should get 100% when it's collective ratings and reviews, but people can give 100% when it's just how much they liked it.

10/10 doesn't mean perfect at least not on my scale. If no show can be 10/10 then what's the point of there even being a ten point scale?

Just reading the comments sickens me how pretty much nobody nowadays even watches or has watched any good anime worth mentioning. Madoka, Clannad. What is this shit.

While I'll agree with your sentiments you could have said them more tactfully, but I'm sure you understand you're going to get down votes for your comment.

Yeah, a lot of VN turned anime shows have what feels like cop out endings. You can't really have the buildup to the "true end" in the VN translated very well to anime format. Steins;Gate especially feels like that, although the new season coming out should remedy the cop-out-ness

After Story is really starting to come alive. Life is hitting Tomoya and Nagisa like a ton of bricks, but they have no choice but to carry on.

I really loved the end of episode 9. Just a very touching scene that really showed why Nagisa and Tomoya are two of the best characters and my favorite couple in all of anime. They're naive, miserable, and fragile, but that's what makes them so human. They're two normal people who deeply care for the other and have nothing but the other in their mind - Tomoya didn't want Nagisa to be alone, while she wanted what's best for him and implored him to always keep moving.
>> ARTICLE
> end of episode 9

just rewatched that scene. And I had totally forgotten about it. Why don't more anime make series with established relationships?

Clannad is still one of the very few shows that actually continues a relationship past the confession mark. So many stories waste all this potential.

I agree, I felt that Shigatsu's episode was still great as it had a lot to offer other than the ending itself though. That entire performance was amazing, and the rest of the show itself leading up to the point was satisfying. Maybe it was a bit too long but I prefer that to the usual too short that we seem to get

Plastic has me salty though because it seemed to literally have been created with a solid start and end point, but everything else was so pointless, mundane and bland that the ending didn't accomplish anything at all for me at least

It's my belief that the performance scene of the last episode of YLIA is probably the most beautiful scene in the medium.

Am I the only one who thinks Non Non Biyori has a deep streak of melancholy?

The fact that there are only 5 students in a school designed for many more. That there are almost no men in the entire world. That Kazu-nee and Candy Store are in dead end jobs, and it looks unlikely that they will ever marry or have children?
>> ARTICLE
It's a combination of melancholy and optimism,  a perfect show for me to relax with but definitely not one that would cause me to cheer up. 

 It's a show about people that live as well as they can while in some rather problematic conditions after all. Their jobs have no future and their social lives are rather limited because of where they live but they still find the time to spend some time with the kids and seem to have fun while doing so.  They seem rather peaceful,  something that most people in similar situations wouldn't be able to manage.

I absolutely agree with /u/PhantomHusk, but on top of that, i have some recommendations for you.

Anime:

- [Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai.)

- [Mahou Shoujo MadokaMagica](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica) (that you have on your watching list without watching a single episode?)

- [Angel Beats!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!) (that you have on your PTW)

- [Kanon (2006)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1530/Kanon_\(2006\))

Movie:

- [Byousoku 5 Centimeter](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter)

There's more, but it should be enough for now.

I find shows that you watch and not expecting to be sad have more emotional impact when you don't know when it's coming.  When people suggest watching these other shows for the "feels", the impact won't be as string as it usually is when you watch it because you're expecting it.

I feel that you should just continue on watching things your own way and eventually pick up shows as they come out to get the most out of them, go in blind!

When people say the Gintama's serious arcs are hypocritical to the series.
>> ARTICLE
Even worse when people say Gintama has no plot line whatsoever....
>> ARTICLE
I'm around 80 episodes in, is there really an overarching plot line? I mean there was the Yagyu arc that I just finished, but I haven't really noticed a continuous plot line. It's still a 10/10 show though so far.
>> ARTICLE
The overarching plot is just trickled in at first, you won't always know what was essential to it till later, but the importance and prevalence of it become more frequent as the series progresses.
>> ARTICLE
There is, it just comes in bits and pieces that start to come at you more and more frequently the further into the series you get.  There isn't much in the first ~120 episodes or so aside from the Benizakura arc and the odd flashback or comment about Gin's past interspersed throughout, but the multi-episode arcs start to become more and more frequent as you get into the higher episode numbers, and those arcs increasingly start becoming more and more about a single, constant plot thread rather than being one-off comedy arcs.  By the time you hit episode 300, the series launches off into long, back-to-back arcs that cover a single continuous plot thread, and pretty much all of the little glimpses you've seen of the plot in previous episodes come together.  It's a glorious moment when everything starts to click together and you retroactively have a deeper understanding of a ton of shit that happened previously in the series.

At the point you're at now though, it's still largely an episodic comedy. While you'll have 10+ episode stretches of standalone episodes where you're at, as you get into the late hundreds and two hundreds, you'll notice that you'll only see 1-3 standalone episodes in between each of the multi-episode arcs.  The comedy is always present regardless of whether or not it's a serious arc though, so you don't have to worry that they're ever going to toss that aside.
>> ARTICLE
I'm around episode 140 something. There are a few serious arcs, the Benizakura arc, The Yagyu arc, The Shinsengumi arc and the Yoshiwara arc. I can definitely see that the series is going somewhere with its plot.

I don't think I've heard any criticisms of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex in a long time.

Well, except maybe that the Major's clothes are fucking stupid. But they *are* fucking stupid so I can't fault anyone for that.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't think I've heard any criticisms of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex in a long time.

I oblige:

* some individual stand alone episodes are bad

* the series lacks characterization for most of the characters - members of Major team except Togusa and Batou are totally neglected. Even Major actually draws a short stick here

* most importantly - the ending of the first season and the whole last episode is thoroughly anti-climactic.
>> ARTICLE
* If you're referring to episodes that ignore the main storyline, like the sentient robots episode, I think they were really good and added to the story indirectly.
* Saito has his own episode. Pazu also gets some background in 2nd GIG. But Borma was neglected, and seemed like a true side character. Yes, the exposition was lacking, but it didn't take much away from the series to be honest. I like a bit of mystery instead of outright spoonfeeding.
* Actually, the finale was pretty interesting. Instead of an epic fight or confrontation, like we were all expecting, we get a deep discussion instead. I agree that it might not cater to all tastes, but I enjoyed it.

For me, GitS is more about the sociological and philosophical repercussions of cyberization than the conflicts or villains Section 9 has to deal with. So when I get an episode about robots trying to hide their sentience, a "reverse" [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test), I get really excited.
>> ARTICLE
> If you're referring to episodes that ignore the main storyline

I'm referring to some of them. Several are very good. Some are not particularly strong.

> Saito has his own episode. Pazu also gets some background in 2nd GIG. But Borma was neglected (...) Yes, the exposition was lacking, but it didn't take much away from the series to be honest.

I honestly don't remember who those three were. And while it isn't that much of a problem, lack of Major development or backstory irked me. This series felt actually more like Batou was the true main character.

> Actually, the finale was pretty interesting. Instead of an epic fight or confrontation, like we were all expecting, we get a deep discussion instead

What we got was [GiTS:SAC first season ending](/s "characters narrating to us what happened and how the conflict was resolved off-screen "). It wasn't a deep discussion, it was a blatant violation of "Show, don't tell rule". And I don't feel this violation was justified there. Personally I was really disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
[GitS SAC S1 finale] (/s "As I recall it, all of the action of the s1 ending happens when section 9 gets invaded. Everything after that was just bureaucracy. It would have been just board meetings and committee hearings, not exactly thrilling stuff.")

[More spoilers for GitS] (/s "Having Togusa be out of the loop with the fates of all the section 9 members being a mystery was pretty much the most interesting thing the writers could have done at that point." )
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't her attair just for allowing her to use her feminine appeal to make parts of her job easier? I really liked that [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAPDFwHjUf8) where Batou asks the Major why she won't switch over to a male shell already for more power before they are about to spar and the major points that it is not all about brute force but about outsmarting your opponent and getting an advantage over them. 
>> ARTICLE
> Wasn't her attair just for allowing her to use her feminine appeal to make parts of her job easier? 

My personal problem is not only that her outfit is sexual fanservice for dubious reason, but also that her outfit is IMO not very sexy. 

So it's sexual fanservice for dubious reason, which doesn't even work. Double fail for me.
>> ARTICLE
Her outfit is also attributed for her wanting to make an impression, to standout. It's a different way of tackling the issues she had in the GitS movie where she was having an existentialist crisis. She could probably choose a less conspicuous attire and even model, but she chooses to standout to make her identity more memorable, she isn't just another model off the factory line etc. 

Even when she switches outfit in 2nd gig, she still wears outfits which stand out many of the times. 

>> ARTICLE
Yeah really one of only criticism I had with SAC was how much they changed the Major compared to the film. She went from black-haired death-machine to purple-haired sex-bot with a wardrobe to match.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. They based her more off [the manga](http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127013/4964489-motoko.jpg) which can throw people off since the Oshii movies are more well-known.

Personally I like the purple hair and face and all, but her SAC (first season) design needs some Goddamn pants.

Shirobako.

Any kind of creative storytelling work chooses its scale based on what works best for its story. Shirobako served as a great workplace story with insight on what happens inside the industry; who the fuck do those guys think they are to complain to the creators about elements of a story they know so much more of, especially when changing it means morphing their intentions of what the story is about.

>> ARTICLE
I really hate the "generic" criticism I see a lot for Toradora.  A plot and premise being generic shouldn't really be much of a factor when you critique a show.  Even the most basic, overused premises can be great if the execution, characters, etc are good.
  
Also the classic, the first half of Steins Gate is so boring.  I mean, its *kinda* slow but those scenes are key to building and developing the relationships between the characters so when shit hits the fan you actually care whats happening.
>> ARTICLE
I don't criticize  Toradora for being generic.

I criticize Toradora because I've never hated a female love interest character as much as I hated Taiga.

Even the girls in shitty school battle harems are boring and cliche at worst, and didn't manage to get me to actively hate them.
>> ARTICLE
I love steins gate but after watching it a couple times I have to say, the first half of the show is horrendously slow.  Yeah it's all necessary, but there are a few episodes in there where it's very difficult to keep my focus.
>> ARTICLE
> Also the classic, the first half of Steins Gate is so boring. I mean, its kinda slow but those scenes are key to building and developing the relationships between the characters so when shit hits the fan you actually care whats happening.

You're expecting people to pay attention to something they're not interested in as leisure time, so that they do feel later. I'm not saying you can't build up, just that build-up doesn't have to be separate from being interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I accept that people find it boring and obviously I don't want someone to force themselves to watch something they're not interested in!
  
I'm just saying its a criticism that bothers me lol
>> ARTICLE
I don't really get bothered by the criticisms of other but if I went with one it would be that people call Kuroko no Basket bad for being unrealistic. That was never the point, within the first three episodes you already have a character who might as well be invisible because of their lack of presence and another who can copy any ability after seeing it. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean I enjoyed the show despite the crazy and unbelievable as fuck athletic displays because I got so hype for every game, but the gripe I had was the fact that an "ankle breaker" is telling somebody to fall to the ground and not juking the shit out of them, and Kagami's childhood rival being able to get away with a double dribble. But other than that it was a great show.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't know people used it as a reason to call the show bad. I mean it doesn't appeal to me *all* that much, but I 'got' the vibe of the show straight away and enjoyed it just fine. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't be surprised if it's because it's always being 1) compared to haikyuu and 2) sports anime straddles the line between anime and real-life sports. Kind of a lose-lose situation if it's too much like realistic sports (like Ping-pong) but also if it's too anime, like dinosaur-exinction serves in Prince of Tennis or Kuroko. Kuroko is actually more popular on MAL (vs haikyuu) but is perceived as being too anime here. For those looking for a little more realism, it's hard to get into.

I do intent to get into Gundam, but it always takes me a while to really feel like I can breach any mech show (yeah, TTGL and CG included). The reason for this is simply because I have never and probably will never find mecha combat entertaining to watch. There's something about it that just completely lacks intensity for me. Does that mean I "hate mech shows"? No, but it does mean there has to be something else there for it to interest me (and from what I understand Gundum does have that in the form of a lot of complex politics stuff, right?)
>> ARTICLE
Gundam IBO
>> ARTICLE
Gundam really isn't about "mecha fights" though in the sense that you take shounen fights, put big robots around them, and make them fight. It's more about tactics and operations, how different characters and mobile suits work together. Some of the hype-r moments of the series come when two mobile suits you've been rooting hard for come together for an operation. There's a reason Gundam was a pioneer in the "real robot" genre. Think more early season Naruto. Or perhaps that's exactly why you find it uninteresting.

That being said, if you want to watch interesting "mech on mech" fights, I suggest G Gundam or Build Fighters...
>> ARTICLE
Wait, do you actually think Gundam shows are all about mecha fights? Do you think of all 52 episodes of a Gundam show all 52 are full on non-stop mecha action? 

Gundam is beloved and popular because it's a well-written wardrama with few of the best written anime characters of all time, that revolutioned mecha genre and as a level anime as a whole. It's basically the show that made anime more than giant robots with superpowers fighting.

Hell, even Gundam Unicorn, an anime with one if the highest budgets ever seen in anime, out of it's 7.5 hour runtime only had enough mecha fights to fill 1.5 hour of that. Mecha fights in Gundam are just there for action most of the time. You could skip all mecha actions scenes with no important story dialogue and you wouldnt lose much. Because mecha fights arent what's important. Saying Gundam must be all about mecha combat and thats why you wont watch it is saying since movie Blade Runner takes place in a cyberpunk futuristic city it must have nonstop crazy futuristic action scenes with lasers and laser swords.
>> ARTICLE
No, not at all. From my initial post:

If you want a unique taster as to the type of combat Universal Century Gundam offers, give MS IGLOO 1 and 2 a view. One episode focuses on a Fedaration tank devision against Zeon mobile suits, while another tells of a lone infantry unit setting an ambush against two Zakus. It's some of the best mecha warfare ive seen portrayed.
>> ARTICLE
Give [Gundam Thunderbolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6jTb2FQ_ow) a shot. It's very short (4 episodes where 3 are currently out and subbed) and roughly 15 minutes long each episode. There's mecha action and there are also a lot of the elements that really illustrate how fucked up war is.

- JoJo is just a generic shounen trying to imitate the old 90s shounen.

- The ending of Part 3 contains not one, but two giant asspulls.

- I'm not gonna watch it because the art is weird.
>> ARTICLE
As someone in the boat with #3, it's not a criticism, just a preference. The anime might be great, but I can't stand the art style.
>> ARTICLE
Have you actually watched any of it, or are you just basing this off of pictures?

I've seen clips.

Hmm, alright. Well, the art changes from Part to Part, and I guarantee it'd grow on you.

JoJo isn't my favorite show, but these criticisms are incredibly dumb.

I've only seen two episodes of Jojo, and that first argument already triggers me.
>> ARTICLE
I hope you don't get too triggered as you keep watching. I want you to enjoy it.

No, no, I mean the argument itself is retarded since Jojo predates the old 90's shounen by a long shot.  Whoever you hear that from is completely retarded.

Ah, I was looking at it from the generic side. I hear that from people on /r/anime.

"JoJo is just a generic shounen trying to imitate the old 90s shounen."

It's funny because Jonathan (and Jotaro, I believe) were based off of Kenshirou from Hokuto no Ken. They don't even have the right decade :/

My favorite complaint I get is "it's weird". Did you... not read the title?

Jotaro is actually based off of Clint Eastwood. In fact, [here's Clint Eastwood meeting Araki and doing the Jotaro point.](http://i.imgur.com/pkBtNUn.jpg)

> JoJo is just a generic shounen trying to imitate the old 90s shounen.

...created in 1986. Some people...

To be fair, part 1 (and to an extent part 2) WERE homages/clones of older classic shonen like Hokuto no Ken. Araki slowly evolved the series away from that over time though.

Let me guess [1](/s "Dio's defeat") and [2](/s "Joseph comes back to live")

I also hate when people trash the entire thing by one or two things, but I can't find argument well enough to defend it, care to share your thoughts mate?
>> ARTICLE
The first one is right, but the second one is wrong.

[JoJo Part 3 Spoilers](/s "Jotaro's time stop is considered to be a huge one by people. There were hints like the items in the prison, catching the bullet, and getting the cigarette/drink during D'Arby the Gambler. That combined with the theory that The World is a combination of the Joestar Stands makes it, in my eyes, not an asspull at all.")
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't the one you gave really explanatory? ["Supposed asspull"](/s "Both Dio and Jotaro acknowledge that Star Platinum and The World have the same power right after we discover Jotaro can also stop time")

What about the first one? I remember you saying that ["asspull"](/s "Dio said his left side was weaker so that's the side Jotaro destroyed, but in the same episode Dio says this, he says that having Joestar blood would completely heal/connect/link/fusion  the body making him a full vampire again").
>> ARTICLE
It is explanatory. But because it's something that "came out of nowhere," it's an asspull.

As for the second one, that's something I overlooked. [Part 3](/s "Although, was that the same leg that Jotaro had injured just moments before? That could have something to do with that.")
>> ARTICLE
Mind elaborating on that theory?

Yeah, sure. I'll just make a pastebin so that there isn't a big wall of black.

well that seems more like a retcon from the author than anything else. I mean Araraki is not really known for being consistent. I mean just take a look at P3 last episode and the jojos and then the dialogue in p4 second episode between the jojos about the cop.


>> ARTICLE
[Part 4](/s "Crazy Diamond itself can't bring somebody back to life, but the way that Joseph was brought back is completely plausible. Sure, the DIO fight felt long, but think of how much of that took place in stopped time. The fight really only lasted a few minutes at most. Getting a blood transfusion and your heart restarted within a few minutes of dying can, and has, brought people back to life before.")
>> ARTICLE
i can agree somewhat, i was just using it as an example. The examples you mentioned sound more like corrections of some sort [p3](/s " then again dio did have a bit of joseph's stand too, that always confused me a bit. Why the hell is the author wasting more time in other parts for dio? I guess he really loves that villain")

[Part 3](/s "It's actually canon that that was Jonathan's Stand, not DIO's.")

Hm, just reading some stuff but are the rest of the jojo parts pretty much around the same timeline as part 4? 'cuz part 1-4 have a few years between, but part 4 and part 5 both MCs (I guess the one u spoke about in part 5 is the MC) are alive and growing up.

4 and 5 take place around similar times, but not the others. In case you were curious, I'll tag them down below.

I can agree there. I remember people were pretty hyped before the show started because of the cover art but when the first 3 or so EPS, a lot of people dropped it. They expected Hotaru to be some kind of yamdere or something from the anime cover

i mean he kind of is but the thing is most people in his situation especially teenagers would be the same way, its understandable why he is like that.

Actually, I would say he isn't. By any stretch of imagination. Maybe it may seem so in comparison to typical gung-ho shounen protagonists, but let's be real here - not wanting to die in a stupidly one-sided battle against a demigod (which for him is like... every fucking friday) is not cowardice, but the thing that allowed mankind to survive so far.
>> ARTICLE
Omg so many people have said this to me in real life when I've talked about shinji being one of my fave characters. He's a kid that has PTSD, he's the most realistic (and developed) 14 year old I've seen in anime and then you have people calling him a pussy cause he's not generic shounen crap that can solve everything with their magical determination. Grrrr!!!!

So, how about [](/s "Rebuild 3.0")?

Ironically, the problem in 3.0 is, that he [](/s "does get in the fucking robot.")

[](/s "Honestly though, in 3.0, he simply has no way of knowing who to trust. On one hand (the not-getting-in-robot hand), he has Misato and Asuka, who treat him like shit. On the other (the getting-in-robot one), he has his father and Rei, who are as apathetic as ever, and Kaworu, who is still the bishounen space Jesus.")

[](/s "Since he can't get and not get into the robot Schrdinger-style, he has to choose a side. He did. Hard to call him a pussy for choosing the less abusive one.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but I'm not seeing how he could get out of this one.

Anno might be setting him up to fail.

i mean the meme is understandable. Viewing NGE as a generic mecha fan all I wanted was for him to stop bitching everytime it was time to fight and just go show me awesome fights, but NGE isnt a generic mecha anime sooo yeah

Yes. [NGE](/s "While feeling all the damage done to his Eva. To save someone who he has no reason whatsoever to like.") Total pussy, right? :|

Shinji being an absolute bitch is a yuge positive for NGE. They wrote him so incredibly well.
>> ARTICLE
Agree.  This was the *whole purpose* of the character.  There's no legitimate way to fault the show for Shinji being this way.  If you don't like Shinji, you don't like the entire point of NGE and might as well move on.
>> ARTICLE
NGE is my absolute favorite anime but I love the Shinji is a pussy jokes. Of course, I appreciate his reluctance to piloting the Eva as a realistic reaction any 14 year old would have to his situation, but damn I laughed so hard when I read that picture comparing NGE to Chi's Sweet Home because the MC of both are pussies.

YLIA and AnoHana have many things wrong with them, and melodrama factors into it. It's not all there is, but AnoHana's last episode was ruined for me with the 10 minutes of chin-tears.
>> ARTICLE
Psycho Pass is pretentious, damningly so. I think it's still good, but the literary quotes and references alone push it at least into the territory of pseudo intellectual masturbation.
>> ARTICLE
Why are literary quotes pseudo-intellectual rather than intellectual? There were subtler literary tie-ins too, and the whole literature thing fed into the classic question of knowledge and power.
>> ARTICLE
Because when you have to point out why you're being "intellectual" it just misses the point. Just imagine you're talking to someone, and the person instead of going about the general ideas from someone you've already read the works of, goes on and just directly quotes them, without any context or idea behind it.

It sounds, and hell, IS very much pretentious.
>> ARTICLE
Pretentious would mean that the referencing doesn't apply. The references in Psycho-Pass do add a lot to the story, but mostly to the characters. They are incredibly relevant and serve a purpose. To call it pretentious because of this is not really accurate.
>> ARTICLE
To some extent I've wondered if Makishima and Kougami are supposed to be pretentious characters. It would seem to fit.

Either way, I'd rather have a pretentious show that tries than one that doesn't, honestly.

Ajin's CG is just soo choppy.. I will never get me to watch it I think, eventhough the plot seems interesting

TBH they are for me. Part of the reason why I stopped watching it regularly. 

Still, after it is being hailed as a great anime, makes me watch them maybe once or twice a fortnight
>> ARTICLE
> Shirobako has too many characters.

See, I've made this point in the past, but it's personally meant to be less of a criticism of the actual series and more that I lacked the capacity to keep track of who every character actually was, which hampered my enjoyment a little. I wouldn't want them to *remove* characters.
>> ARTICLE
The first four are specifically my triggers.

"X has shit worldbuilding"

"Y is just edgy/pretentious"

"Z is forced and melodramatic"

"_____ Character is just a plot device"

People say this shit all the fucking time, and I swear like half the time they don't even know what it means. They just spout it about anything they dislike.

I could say random shit like "Haruko is a plot device", "Hunter x Hunter is pretentious". It doesn't make it true.
>> ARTICLE
> "Y is just edgy/pretentious"

This one in particular pisses me off if there's no context given. Pretentious means literally acting as if it has more value than it does. Don't call something pretentious unless you're done going over all of the reasons it's not good and all of the ways it's trying to trick you into thinking it is. Only then have you earned it.
>> ARTICLE
I've recommended Code Geass to a few friends, since they like that type of genre, and they refuse to watch it because they hate how tall the characters are.

Not a specific show but i hate it when people complain about fanservice in shows that are classified under the ecchi genre  
>> ARTICLE
it's like complaining about nudity in porn. it's the whole point
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's comparable. If it was straight up hentai, then that statement might hold some merit, but there are shows that could be better without the fanservice/ecchi. Just because a show includes fanservice doesn't mean that fanservice is the entire point of the show. Maybe that element of the show is less significant to someone than some other element. 

Prime example would be the Monogatari series. Virtually no one watches that show exclusively for the fanservice. For some people it's a nice cherry on top of an otherwise good show, for others it makes the show more unfocused and distracts from what's good about it. But for pretty much no one is it gonna be the only reason that they watch it.

Not every ecchi show is like High School DxD, where the ecchi is more or less the point, but many shows include ecchi elements without being defined by them (but still having them listed as being in the ecchi genre).

for people thinking it's too long, it's not as long as other shows. it took me around 2 months to watch it, but if someone dedicated themselves to it, they could probably finish it in a few weeks.

Attack on Titan having "bad pacing".

Does it manage to entertain you every second of it's airtime? Then it has good pacing. You looking forward to the next episode is not bad pacing. Not spilling the beans on every mystery in one season is not bad pacing (Just look at Game of Thrones. "We still don't know who Jon's parents are 5/10", said no one ever). Having cliffhangers is not bad pacing. Having some faster- and some slower-paced episodes is not in and of itself bad pacing.

AoT gets a little slow around the end of the battle of Trost. Other then that I would even say the show's pacing is better then most.

[An interview with Shinbou](http://feral-phoenix.livejournal.com/685568.html#%7C)

>You called the previous two movies like a new loop or two of the original series. With that in mind, how is this new movie positioned?


>Shinbou: I think of the TV series as complete in and of itself, and that it doesnt need a continuation. Beginnings and Eternal were necessary to Rebellion, and my personal interpretation is that Rebellion continues from these two movies rather than the TV series.

So Rebellion is a canon addition to a complete TV series. It would be like if they suddenly made a new season of *Breaking Bad*.
>> ARTICLE
Did you bother read what you just quoted? He's saying that he views the TV series and the movies as separate continuities, which would mean that Rebellion is explicitly *not* a canon addition to the TV series.
>> ARTICLE
You do know that the movies are a recap yes? They follow the exact plot from the series, so it stands to reason that Rebellion is canon. Even Shinbou says 'in my mind'.

I'm well aware of what the movies cover, and yes you're free to ignore the creator's opinion on how they should be viewed if you really must. However he is *very* clear in the section you quoted that in his view Rebellion is *not* a sequel to the TV series. I'm not sure why you have so much trouble grasping this concept.

>However he is very clear in the section you quoted that in his view Rebellion is not a sequel to the TV series. 

I never once claimed this.

Did you read the interview?

>Shinbou: Concerning the kinds of spinoffs and prequels you just mentioned, I think that groups other than Shaft should go ahead and make those as fanworks. Puella Magi Madoka Magica leaves a lot of room for fanfiction and fan interpretations, and we want all of those to be made. We dont think theres any need to close off the gaps fans have to create those kinds of works. Actually, we decided to continue the story specifically to make this world bigger and more fun to play with. I loved the characters in Madoka Magica, so I wanted to **create the story of what happened to them next.**

They wanted to continue the story.

I think /u/Ralon17 said it best:

If we accept the recap movies as canon then we must accept Rebellion as canon.

Actually, you did. You said it was an addition to the TV series and that it would be "just like another season of Breaking Bad".
>> ARTICLE
My source may have been a comment rather than first-hand reading it.

To say Rebeliion is a canon addition to a complete TV series sounds a little paradoxical. Complete implies that that's what happens end of story, or that it's been wrapped up. Rebellion undermines the main series so it sounds more like there's two alternate canon options or something. Which I'd be fine with. I like to think that the series is what ultimately happens.

I just dislike it because on one hand I think it's a betrayal of Homura's character as to how she was portrayed at the end of PMMM.

On the other end I also didn't like [PMMM & Rebellion spoilers] (/s "Madoka being portrayed as an actual god rather than an abstract concept/law of the universe") 
>> ARTICLE
It makes perfect sense, it was just really depressing. It's also just Urobuchi's Faust. Makes so much sense when you see it like that.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a *huge* Madoka fan, but the ending is pretty confusing unless you're paying perfect attention to all the mechanics the show presents. Otherwise you'll be asking perfectly legitimate questions like:

[Madoka Rebellion Heavy Spoilers](/s "What did Homura just do? Why did she do that? How did she even do that? Isn't the pink-haired girl supposed to be some sort of god? How was Homura able to steal a god's power? I thought Pink-hair had way too much potential for that! Does Homura even have enough? How did they even suspend Homura in stasis at the moment of witchifying when witches aren't supposed to exist anymore? What is going on? Do they remember any of this?")

Sure, all of those questions have answers, but throwing all of this at the average viewer and expecting them not to be confused the first time through is naive.

Not to mention you have to understand everything while the background spends the entire movie tripping out. Much preferred the original season keeping at least half their backgrounds grounded in reality, though I've heard that's an unpopular opinion.
>> ARTICLE
The only one I could understand is the [madoka](/s "how did she do it") as its never really explained. I'd definitely hope that the viewer has enough of a grasp to understand the others as they are painstakingly obvious and are even explained via dialogue. I can't imagine anyone questioning [if](/s "they can still remember, or who Madoka is.")
>> ARTICLE
Now I'm the kind of guy that likes shows such as Penguindrum and Evangelion so take this opinion as you will, but so long as the show provides answers (which Madoka Magica and Rebellion absolutely does), I don't see a problem with those answers being a little difficult to find. Yes it can be confusing and you almost certainly won't follow everything your first time, but more time spent with exposition means less time actually developing the themes of the show, and Rebellion already provides an info dump 2/3 of the way through. If someone just doesn't understand and doesn't want to take the time to rewatch it or look up information online, or (gasp!) actually think about it for themselves, then that's on them and not the show. I mean fuck, at least Rebellion encapsulates it's themes and plot without requiring some obscure games or novels to fully understand (looking at you, Ikuhara), and it really isn't that complicated compared to some other shows. If Rebellion was a book or a live action movie, all the artistic abstractness and twists would be far more accepted. The problem is that lots of people who watch anime just want to sit down and watch cool shit. There isn't anything wrong with that, but sometimes you gotta give something back to the anime you are watching in order to really appreciate it.

The biggest issue with Rebellion is the audience; Madoka Magica is one of the most recommended shows out there, even for newcomers. You get people that only watch the super popular hyped shows, and suddenly you throw them Madoka Magica. The main series is already pretty weird and throws people for a loop, but overall they can come to accept it because it is fairly straightforward. But then Rebellion is something else entirely. Morality of God? The price of free will? Complex character motivations that aren't explicitly thrown at your face? Rebellion isn't as easy as the main series to just mindlessly consume. It requires thinking of your own to understand, a demand that already turns a lot of people off. To me, it is one of the worst criticisms of the movie because you aren't criticizing anything of value, you're just telling me "I didn't care enough to think about it." As far as personal opinions go that's fine, but it is NOT a fair condemnation of the movie.

[Madoka Rebellion spoilers](/s "I mean, yes the ending makes sense from the logical perspective of 'this is the choice the character might have made in this situation', but I don't think the ending makes even the slightest amount of sense dramatically speaking.

[Rebellion ](/s "the name of the movie is Rebellion! It was supposed to go against the themes in the previous instalment. Homura's motivation was clear: she failed to protect Madoka even after 10 years of trying, which culminated in it being impossible to try again. Given the chance to 'save' Madoka (in her eyes) she took it. The entirety of the movie sets itself up for this. Madoka says she wouldn't be able to leave her friends behind, as she does in the TV series, causing Homura to think she was suffering as the new god. She took it upon herself to 'rescue' Madoka from her eternal state and bring her back into existence ")

[Rebellion](/s "As I said, I was never questioning the consistency of Homura's motivations, I was only questioning the dramatic effect of her actions.  And since you've said Rebellion is supposed to go against the themes of the TV series, that would be all well and good if that were the extent of it.  At least to me however, as Rebellion was presented, half of it seems to be to be broadcasting the themes of the TV series while the other half seems to be broadcasting the themes of the Rebellion ending.  And, due to the sudden nature in which the changes in Homura are revealed, there isn't really much of a transition between the two either.  The result is that to me the whole movie just feels like a fragmented mess.")
>> ARTICLE
[Rebellion stuff](/s "Given how the show ends, I don't see at all how the movie's end isn't dramatically consistent. By this point you should almost expect it with Urobuchi. Without getting into too much detail and keeping things basic, because I don't want to write an essay, if we were to go with the original idea of how the movie was going to end, Homura goes to heaven or whatever and none of the demon thing and assume that that's the ending everyone wants, truthfully, that would be the ending that clashes with the show the most. In all honesty, if that's the one we got, it would feel cliche and out of place. Looking back at how the show ends and the feeling and atmosphere it's supposed to evoke, I find it hard to believe that the one we got doesn't fit dramatically.
I suspect what most people want is answers to the questions that the ending has now placed on the table, ie. what does this mean for so and so, what's going to happen next. Which is fine, it makes sense to have those questions, it's just that they should say that instead of saying the ending made no sense.")

Favorite show is Angel Beats, and I usually dislike hearing people's complaints that the side characters of the battlefront are not fleshed out. I will admit arcs that build around their past and why they act the way they do would be really cool and could only better the experience of watching Angel Beats, but in my opinion its an unfair criticism of the show just to point a 13 episode series is lacking this sort of content.

The main characters in Angel Beats are Otonashi and Yuri. Everyone else really doesn't matter unless they have an arc that focuses on them (Iwasawa, Yui, and Naoi as examples). Angel Beats does a really good job with its attention towards its 2 main characters, that you both see them grow meaningfully as characters and understand the motives that drive them. We also see their arcs finish in conclusive ways to complete them by the end of the show.

The side characters such as Takamatsu, Noda, TK, and Shiina don't need that. They aren't the focus of the show. They all have clearly defined personalities so that they can still add meaningful presence to the scenes they belong to and end up being memorable as characters even if we have no idea about their past or actual inner thoughts. They're just interesting people that Otonashi (the character whose point of view we watch the show from) is surrounded by. Can you really tell me you'd remember the name of male best friend A (unless its TOMODAAAAAA) from some random show like you'd remember who TK is as he spouts some random english phrase? I personally don't think so.
>> ARTICLE
Very solid points here. I hadn't really thought about it before, but that particular criticism can be pretty damn ridiculous and is applied to a lot of shows. Obviously sometimes it makes sense when a character is meant to be more of a focus and isn't fleshed out enough or if a side character behaves in a way that completely betrays the show's own logic (I won't say unrealistic because sometimes a show's logic isn't realism), but a lot of the time "not fleshed out" is used to justify not liking a show when really you haven't put enough thought into what bothers you about it.

This is more in general, but "I expected it to be an X genre show, but it was more about Y genre, so I hate it for going against my expectations."

Probably the most recent example being Rokka no Yuusha, where a lot of people were expecting a braindead action show, and when they saw it was more of a mystery, even with a bunch of cool fight scenes in it, they felt 'betrayed' for some reason and dropped it. It isn't the shows fault that you're an idiot.
>> ARTICLE
I have a somewhat similar problem with Toradora actually. I knew the genre going in, but for whatever reason I was under the impression that the main two got together much earlier in the show, and in fact watched it because I was tired of not seeing pairings get together until the very end, if at all. 

Objectively, I realize it was a pretty good quality rom-com. But I'll probably never like it solely because of that.

dropping a show because it's not what you expected and what you got instead isn't your cup of tea is perfectly fine imo

That's a perfectly valid reason to dislike a show, not everyone has the same genre preferences.

Fuck it, yolo. SAO:

>Kirito is super unlikable, has no character development.

That's just an opinion, and straight up untrue. He starts as a loner not willing to risk his life for anyone, halfway through the first arc he literally risks his life to save others after experience a trauma with his friends being killed. I mean he even develops PTSD at one point.

>Kirito is too OP/has invincible plot armor.

Let's be real, most MCs are. But at least Kirito has a reason. Have you ever played an MMo wher ehigh level players are *not* way more powerful than low level players? Plus he gets his ass kicked a ton of times, he just happens to be really good at games for the most part.

>Kirito's [SAO Spoiler](/s "Dual wield ability") is a total asspull and unrealistic in the MMO. He shouldn't be the only one with a unique skill.

There's 10 unique skills. Klein is one of the 10 owners of the katana skill. Heathcliff has another one. Why is it only a problem that a dude we've already established as having naturally incredible reaction time and skill has one too?

>Asuna becomes a generic damsel in distress

I mean she was awesome for the first part and is continually shown to be pretty much just as good as Kirito is at the game. She tries to escape several times, one of them being key to her actually being able to get out by stealing the access card.

>The villains suck and are generic psycho rapists.

One of them is a psycho maybe rapist dude. Those do actually exist in real life.

> Yui was stupid

This is subjective, and not a valid criticism. I happen to agree though. I don't like Yui.

> Weird crazy incest is creepy

I don't see how it's absolutely *impossible* to meet someone online and start to fall in love with them when you have no reason to believe you're related at all and you haven't talked to said person very much in almost 2 years. They never actually do anything. And people seem to be fine with Oreimo, which *actually* has incest.

>the romance is forced

I mean, the first novel makes it pretty clear that it really is about Kirito and Asuna developing their relationship in the game. It's not forced at all.

>Generic characters

Still mostly an opinion. Sinon, Yuuki, Asuna, Suguha are all pretty good characters imo.

>Pacing is bad and timeskips are awful.

Maybe valid, but that's how it was written. The first LN is about the 74th floor and up for the most part and the 2nd novel is the side stories that make up the first 5 or so episodes. They put it into chronological order, that's really the best you can do.

And I'm not even gonna address stuff like "Kirito's edgelord rant is 2edgy4me" ala Digibro, because anyone who says that obviously didn't even try to understand the reason he did it.

SAO has flaws like every other anime does, for the most part. It's nowhere near perfect, but there's a difference between valid, objective criticism and blind hate based on your opinion. Almost all of these fall under subjective criticism for the sake of being critical of the show.

>> ARTICLE
It shouldn't have been their in the first place.  The only purpose of her character is to have some creepy incest subplot.
 Or, as a certain someone so elegantly put it.

"Being boring and one-dimensional must run in Kiritos family, because his fake sister gives him a run for his money in both regards, with the added bonus of being completely erroneous. I could supercut the entire Fairy Dance arc to include only the scenes where Suguha isnt around, and it wouldnt change the core narrative of the arc in the slightest. Everything that happens from the moment Kirito meets Suguha inside of the game, up through the moment that he leaves her behind to go take on the final boss, is a completely pointless distraction that adds nothing to the story of Kirito trying to get his girlfriend back.

Suguhas entire character boils down to two words: loves Kirito. Every thought that she has, every action she takes, all of it revolves around the fact that shes in love with Kirito. She becomes his companion for the whole Fairy Dance arc because she seems to be vaguely in love with his in-game character, whom she doesnt realize is the same person as the fake brother whom shes in love with. This of course leads to the ironic twist where, after realizing that shes never going to get with Kirito because hes in love with Asuna, she decides to chase his game avatar instead, only to find out that he, too, is in love with Asuna.

As viewers, we already know everything that Suguha is going to experience before it even happens. The moment were aware that shes in love with Kirito, which is instantly, we know that shes going to be let down eventually, and that shes going to find out that the character in the game is the same as her brother. Were then subjected to around eight episodes of Suguha being flustered over him, before she finally realizes everything, confesses, admits defeat, helps him out like she was already doing, and resigns from relevance.

Suguhas presence in the story is obnoxiously boring, but its made far worse by just how stupid it is that she takes so long to realize Kirito in the game is her brother. Even if we assume that Kirito exclusively uses the name Kirito in online games, he still has the exact same face, eyes, voice, and attitude that he has in real life, plus his username is just a really obvious abbreviation of his first and last names. Suguhas character looks nothing like her, and she roll-plays a more headstrong character, so its a little more acceptable that Kirito doesnt notice its her, especially having barely heard her voice in the last two years. However, Suguha not recognizing the guy whom shes hopelessly obsessed with when hes barely different from his real-world counterpart is just utterly fucking stupid.

Worse still is the fact that Suguha never mentions to Kirito that shes been playing a virtual MMO game. When Suguha explains how she got into the game, she specifically mentions understanding how Kirito felt about these games. So why does she never make this a topic of conversation? Heres this thing that Kirito is massively passionate about, which would make an excellent conversation starter and bonding experience, and she never even mentions the games existence to him. In scenes where the two ask one-another about why they were up late, Kirito never mentions going into the game, which might be understandable because he doesnt want to worry Suguha; but she lies and tells him that shes been on the internet. Why? What possible reason could she have for hiding the fact that she plays this game? Is it because if she did tell him, then theyd find out that theyve been playing together? Has Suguha been reading the script? Whats that? Is that the script over there in the grass?"

It was implied that sister person already had feelings for Kirito before that (or straight up made clear I believe). So this point holds less ground. Sure, they don't do anything, but people are getting a bit tired of the "little sister is in love with older brother" trope that they shoehorned in.

I just want to correct one thing: Klein's use of Katana isn't a Unique Skill nor an Over Skill, it's an Extra Skill gained from using Curved Blades until a high skill level, and it becomes unlocked, that he happened to discover.

The only known Unique Skills are Dual Wield and Holy Sword (Heathcliff's ability), a few are mentioned in the LNs , but are never shown, nor given much of an explanation.
>> ARTICLE
They are all extra skills, the Dual Wield and Holy sword ones just happen to be "unique" because only one person can have them at the same time. The Katana skill is still an extra skill, like martial arts.
>> ARTICLE
No, they each have specific names because they are seperate ideas, outside of the fact they are all skills (Sword Skills, Combat Skills, etc).

Unique skills exist solely in one single person, and some have "harder" peramiters then others (the four others mentioned in the novel iirc unlock after the 90th floor). Only two were shown, Heathcliff's (which was given to him intentionally), and Kirito because he was deemed the fastest reaction time in the game (because Yuuki wasn't logged in at the time). Only one person can possibly have the skill.

Extra skills are unlocked via a quest or from doing something specific (such as leveling up curved blades enough to unlock Katana skill). Usually around 10 people or less end up with any specific extra skill.

Sword skills exist as the primary combat ability (they are unlocked via other skills and leveling up, for example Dual Wielding allows one to use Star Scream Burst).

Combat skills are anything combat related (first aid, combat healing, parrying, taunts, equipment profeciency)

Weapon skills are all the directly relevant weapon profeciencies (Curved Blades, Sheilds, dual weild and holy sword are Unique skills that adds themselves to the weapon category).

There are also support skills (acrobatics, crafting, hiding, gathering wood/ore/plants, swimming, etc.).

Over skills, or "Outer System Skills" aren't technically skills (they don't exist as factual numerical things in the persona window), but they are referred to as if many players recognize their existence.

**TLDR** Unique skills and Extra Skills are actually just "Skills" that add themselves to the relevant skill lists, they aren't the same thing at all, they are unlocked and given out in a separate but vaguely similar manner.

**TLDRTLDR** Anything with "skill" in its name is a skill. Each sub-type isn't the same thing at all.
>> ARTICLE
All "unique skills" are really extra skills. Not every extra skill is a unique skill.

> Weird crazy incest is creepy

Yeah, the same people that say this praise Nisemonogatari and Oreimo regularly so....

> I mean, the first novel makes it pretty clear that it really is about Kirito and Asuna developing their relationship in the game.

This is what made me actually start to LIKE SAO. Before that it felt like a .Hack ripoff. But I felt like they had a pretty believable relationship. Even trying to become parents. Sure it was a little childish in how they went about it, but they ARE kids. They got to play house so hard it became real.

I'm glad you took the time to make this post and definitely deserve an upvote. I share the same feelings towards the show that you have. I even thought about making my post about people complaining about Kirito being an unreasonable OP main characters, but you explained that really well talking about how high lvl characters in MMORPGs are going to shred the competition compared to low levels. I would've also added it makes sense Kirito got the dual wield ability because he was one of the highest level characters so its likely that he would get such a skill before anyone else. And it makes sense why hes so high level due to the fact that he understood the game from beta, has a natural affinity towards gaming, so its like he solo'd most of the game(which is incredibly difficult, but also rewarding since you don't need to share stuff like drops or xp) for most of his time in SAO.  You even went as far to cover most of the other complaints, hats off to you!

I think some of your points are valid, especially about Kirito but some are unjustifiable.

It's not because they exist in real life that you can just throw one and say "hey look he is a villain he tried to rape the good girl".
[SAO](/s "when your villain says himself that he forgot why he did it it's time to question your writting.")

>Pacing is bad and timeskips are awful.
Maybe valid, but that's how it was written.

It's not because it was written like this that it makes it any good. Maybe your point was that we should criticize the LN for this ?

How do you define a valid AND objective criticism ? Is there somewhere I can check if my opinion is valid and relevant ?

The point about him being OP isn't really my issue. It's how he is the strongest character in the whole show (minus the one spoiler guy) while being a SOLO player on an MMORPG. That part is borderline ridiculous and he even states multiple times how he's playing ineffectively and how he's reaching the limits a solo person can. 

I think they coulda made the big guild a whole lot more intimidating and impactful if they were all stronger than Kirito by a large margain. And by extension of that Asuna should be stronger than Kirito too, it just makes more sense.

That isn't a valid defense when it comes defending the writing of a fictional work.

It kind of bothers me when people say things to the effect of "Yeah I didn't really like Toradora, but Ami was a really great character!  If only all of the characters were as good as her..."

Like, real talk for a minute, Toradora is fundamentally a story about-among other things-emotions and sincerity.  It's about identifying what in the world you want and then going out and grabbing it by the horns without hesitation.  Now, I actually agree Ami is a great character, but she only works because there's just one of her.  If all of the characters were--like Ami--mostly distant and collected individuals who were content to look down on the world as it ran by them, it would fundamentally destroy the type of show Toradora was trying to be.  And like, I get that you didn't like the actual meat of the show itself (which is probably why you liked Ami aka the dramatic foil better than everyone else), but to me this complaint is basically the same thing as watching a Gundam series and then complaining about how much better it would have been without the giant robots.  Like, even if it's true that you would have liked the show more had they taken that option instead, it doesn't make any sense to try and paint that as a criticism of the show because it completely goes against what the show was actually trying to do.

"Steins;Gate's dub is bad." Seeing that once triggered me real fukkin quick. Honestly I think this dub is one the finest works of voice acting in general that I've experienced, not just dubbed anime.

"Steins;Gate wasn't funny" Comedy is super subjective, and very hit or miss, but I thought it was hilarious. One of the funniest I've seen. I thought the comedic writing was brilliant a lot of the time.

While Steins;Gate really wasn't my thing, I do have to say I really enjoyed the Dub. While I prefer dubs in general, that one was rather good.

Could you explain [UBW](/s "Archer coming back? I don't think the anime explained it/I might have missed how he could have come back. Was it better explained in the VN?")
>> ARTICLE
[UBW] (/s "Archer has an ability called Independent Action which allows him to stay w/o a Master supplying him mana for a period of 3 days provided his spiritual core has not been destroyed"). I don't think it was mentioned in the anime but in the VN it was.
>> ARTICLE
That explains a lot. The two biggest complaints I've heard about the UBW anime are [spoilers](/s "Archer coming back and the mana transfer scene.")
>> ARTICLE
I think I was wrong on this one. Sorry. Actually, there are a few theories as to how [UBW] (/s "Archer came back. The theory is that because Archer is a Counter Guardian, the World sent him back after he died to prevent the disaster from happening. 
Another theory is that he faked his death when pierced by Gilgamesh's NP but this isn't plausible because I'm sure other Servants can sense each other")
>> ARTICLE
Nope, Counter Force doesn't do that. If the counter force has to be deployed, they'll nuke the place and everything within a couple of thousands K radius. 

That one in particular, is an ass pull.
>> ARTICLE
That's not true. [](/s "CGs exist to maintain a balance. That could involve mass killing- or a single assassination. The fan theory that Archer's last appearance was Emiya as a CG is about as valid as "Somehow even with having said he was out of mana like ten times, Independent Action kept him going")
>> ARTICLE
Except that in this particular case,  if things escalated to an extent that CGs needs to be deployed, they will blow everything up for good measures. [FSN VN](/s "if it only require 1 CG to be deployed to kill it,  then the grail in that state is not big enough of a threat to deploy a CG in the first place")
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily, the Counter Force has been known to take extremely subtle means to prevent global catastrophes as well, such as manipulating a person's actions. For example, in Witch on the Holy Night and Kara no Kyoukai.
>> ARTICLE
[FSN VN Spoiler](/s "The only "global catastrophy" worth noticing by the CF is Heaven's Feel birth of Angra Mainyu, as that involved 3rd Magic and possible permanent damage to the heroic spirit system. In UBW, the grail will implode killing a few hundred thousand people in the worst case scenario, not something that they'll have to interfere. Its like the Federal Police not worrying about local crimes. In addition, the CF explanation is still incorrect. If Archer was still a servant, and not a CG, his power up is an asspull. If he's there as a CG, why does he have free thoughts and free actions? From the KnK pamphet: "The emphasis here is "Counter", because they have no autonomy and will only activate in response to an event."")
>> ARTICLE
You're failing to recognize the difference between the Counter *Force*, and the Counter *Guardians*. The former is a defense mechanism to prevent catastrophes that could wipe out humanity or the planet itself, the latter is just one of the tools that Counter Force uses.

There are also multiple instances of the Counter Force preventing global catastrophes outside of the 3rd HGW. Touko mentions that Atlanta was sunk to prevent some sort of apocalypse, and in [Kara no Kyoukai Spoilers]( /s "Ryougi was intentionally driven by the Counter Force to eliminate Araya Souren." ) Also, [Witch on the Holy Night Spoilers]( /s "Aoko is stalked by Alaya's spectre her entire life to ensure she doesn't try and abuse her Sorcery, keeping her neck at a fingers length." )

[Unlimited Blade Work Spoilers]( /s "It is absolutely possible that Emiya was boosted/nudged by the Counter Force in the same way that Arcueid/Ryougi were. It's vague, and could be completely false, but a very solid explanation is possibly there.")
>> ARTICLE
Uh, in what part did I mention otherwise?

Araya Souren is a global catastrophe due to his research and actions relating to the Akashic Record. Aoko misusing Five and destroying the world from the energy generated is certainly a catastrophe. [FSN VN](/s "The grail mud in UBW is not. Its simply a metaphorical bomb that will, at the very worst wipe out a small portion of Japan. Unlike in HF where its manifested properly with a proper container, and was a giant Third Magic machine, which when abused like it was is definitely a global catastrophe."). In addition:

[UBW spoiler](/s "Archer being deployed as a Counter Guardian is inconsistent with its internal logic, as CGs are mindless, autonomous shell with their ability, while that Archer was still his servant shell would bring up multiple existing issues like how did he survive, where did he get the mana, etc...")
>> ARTICLE
[Unlimited Blade Works Spoiler]( /s "Being deployed as a Counter Guardian is not the same thing as being *boosted* by the Counter *Force* to finish a task. I said it before but I'll say it again; the Counter Force has other methods of solving problems aside from nuking things with Counter Guardians. Just like I've stated in my comment above, it's easily possible that he was boosted/nudged in the same way Arcueid/Ryougi were. Again, the Counter Guardians are just one of the many tools in the Counter Force's disposal.")

Understand that [UBW](/s "the mana transfer scene will always make no since in the Fate universe unless you want the R/XXX rating, because it was the 'transfer' of certain fluids that established the link for the transfer.")

As for the [UBW](/s "saving shot, it is pretty much stated by TypeMoon that he was not killed by Shirou or Gilgamesh, instead fleeing for the right moment, as for not being detected, the ability for one servant to detect another has a range as Archer himself explained to Rin earlier in the series.")

>> ARTICLE
Perhaps, but then again it's also worth mentioning that this was an ufotable work. Looking through and trying to remember, but I'm not really certain that any of ufotable's animes (with the exception of perhaps the Kara no Kyoukai series, but I don't think so) have sex or even really a good nod towards sex in them. Ufotable will do romance and they're really good at blood and tragedy, so perhaps ufotable doesn't seem to care about throwing sex into the mix.

Evangelion isn't edgy. It's a story about a teenager's struggle with being abandoned by his family.

Cowboy Bebop:

"The story doesn't go anywhere."

Bebop ain't meant to be marathoned, son. Think of the episodes as miniature movies.

True, it doesn't have a continuous plot that advances every episode, but it's not designed to be that way.

Which cuts both ways. You have to get familiar, get invested, ride the roller coaster, get off, and get uninvested all before starting it all over again.

And then if you aren't liking the next arc as well as the previous one you'll put it off because you're obviously still too invested in the last one.

And then by the time you've almost finished the first season, you'll have started to forget the first arcs, and then how can you move on to the second season?
>> ARTICLE
Well the good thing about Amagami is how conclusive it is so when an arc ends you're usually feeling pretty satisfied.

Ah see for me I just get excited again that I get to experience another good arc.

> you'll have started to forget the first arcs, and then how can you move on to the second season?

Not too much to forget haha 
>> ARTICLE
The format is what is stopping me from moving this show higher up on my priortities list. I'm a massive fan of romance shows, far more than most other genres, so I will watch Amagami eventually. But I don't think I'll enjoy it that much.

To me, the omnibus format means that none of it is "real". I don't want to invest myself in a couple and immerse myself in their romantic journey if a few episodes later, it's completely different and another girl becomes the one for the MC. They are not in-universe canonical relationships.

Again, I haven't seen the show, but I don't think that there's an in-universe device that explains multiple realities. Meaning none of the relationships seem like they will be "real" to me. I don't like shows that "go outside of themselves" and require some sort of meta-thinking to make them "work". It's why I did not enjoy the last few episodes of Evangelion (End was better, but still put a sour taste in my mouth). I feel like you'd need meta-thinking to have a couple exist in-universe.

I'm not very good at articulating my opinions, so I don't know if this will make sense to other people. You're around here a lot and you've got that swanky tag, so I had planned on asking you about why I should watch the show (because I really and truly do love romance shows, and I feel that there are not as many satisfactory ones as I'd like). I feel this is a good time for my worries to be settled, if you've the time.
>> ARTICLE
> To me, the omnibus format means that none of it is "real".

Yeah see I'm happy I never saw it like that, for me it was always separate love stories.

> They are not in-universe canonical relationships.

Just choose your own canon one at the end :p

> I don't like shows that "go outside of themselves" and require some sort of meta-thinking to make them "work".

It's a really simple show! It's just a bunch of short romances, it's less multiple realities and just different stories.

One of the reasons (besides the omnibums format and the characters) I enjoy Amagami SS a lot is because it's conclusive. As a romance you should know how often we get stuck at the show ending with a kiss or most of the time not even getting there! Amagami ends most of its arcs pretty well and it doesn't spend time on love triangle and useless drama. It's a pure romance that's just happy to watch!

I'm tired of there being no new criticisms of Angel Beats!, and everyone stating the same old circlejerks about it like we haven't heard them a million times already with the exact same phraseology.

It has flaws, sure. But not the ones people bolt on to their criticism of it from whatever MAL review they liked the tone and score of most. All the 'faults' of AB!'s design are the sorts of things that aren't even overlooked by fans of the series - they're part of how the themes and characters are formed in such an interesting an enjoyable way. The problem is if you simply didn't like the characters or style in the first place.

> It was rushed/should have been 24 episodes

Either there's a long-running joke I'm not in on or it's really true that barely anyone bothers to notice that a story about the unfair transience of life is unfairly short. 

Of course, Maeda didn't pick the length, and we all know he wanted a longer space and thought it was a 'miracle' at the end that everything came together. But once he was given the length, like any artist, he tried to work with it. And so we have the implication that this could be a 24 episode plot with [AB!](/s "Otonashi saying he'll go through everyone one-by-one, as the MC does in, say, Clannad") with the tragic reality on both the level of the writer not being given the time and Otonashi likewise being denied his plan [AB!](/s "by the emergence of the shadows.") These thing are unfair, but they don't have to be dissatisfying if you link the brevity of the show to the struggle of everyone in it against that sense of the shortness of life.

Even if you didn't like the feeling of unfair brevity in the plot, at least acknowledge it ties into the whole point of the show. Most viewers/critics who call AB! rushed seem far more concerned with Maeda as writer than his character as they watch, only wanting to see how the design of the show relates to him and not how it relates to itself.

> Undeveloped characters

Otonashi is as developed as *you* want him to be, beyond his backstory flashback. All the questions of the last couple of episodes tie into him and the reality of his character - the meat of his character isn't handed to you on a plate. If you didn't like his character to begin with, you won't go looking for the answers and go back over the show (which again ties into the whole point of the show of looking back over your past...) in order to fully figure him out.

Yurippe has more clear character development of always wanting to protect a family, though not many people seem to think about [AB!](/s "How bittersweet it is that the moment she realizes the SSS are that family she wanted to protect and wanted to relate to them as that, it was time for them to move on. Unfair brevity of lie again.")

For Kanade, see Otonashi.

Everyone else either has a minor arc that you can't complain about unless you have a nonsensical iron prejudice against 'sob stories' (really, since when could a character backstory not be told in one micro-narrative), and anyone looking back over the show will also see that those minor characters had subtle development that led into their sob story before

As for the rest, they're introduced as Yurippe as types and cliches on purpose. The fact we get to know *nothing* about some of them beyond that type links so strongly to [AB!](/s "Otonashi's failure to go through them one-by-one"). Could even think about how this relates to high school life and how transient that experience is - don't we all leave school having known some of our friends as only superficial performances of gags? I know I did.

> The ending was an asspull

See the above about Otonashi. Take a few minutes to piece the plot together and it makes complete, even beautiful, sense what happens at the end.

> You only liked it because it made you cry.

Loved episode 3. Never cried at it.

Maeda's flaws are not putting characters and stories too big for a 13 episode show into a 13 episode show; that's the *whole point* of Angel Beats!. The problem is that if the characters and style don't appeal to you, you'll never want to see the unfairness of a number of things in the show as anything but failures of the writer. But failure of narrative is not inherently failure of a story; read a few great modernist novels and remind yourself that the inability to get X's backstory can sometimes be the point the writer is trying to make. And even if you want to argue these things weren't 'intentional' (as if that matters), just change that thought to 'the point the story makes on its own'.

Angel Beats! *is* rushed, and many of its characters *are* entirely undeveloped. More people would enjoy it if the internet didn't perpetuate poor perspectives on those things that make people believe that 'all characters must be round' (bleugh) or that all stories must have a comfortable sense of pace or that everything that you want to see in a story should be given to you.

So, fundamentally, I get pissed off at the fact that people approach AB! like they still live in the 19th century.

My only criticism of Naruto is the metric fuckton of filler, flashbacks, and maybe the flippy-floppyness of some of the villains.

"Light is one-dimensional and pure evil" is something i've heard constantly long before I even watched DN and it always annoys me.

It's not just limited to Light, it's whenever somebody doesn't even bother to understand a characters actions and just labels him/her something stupid (Shinji is another big example).
>> ARTICLE
I agree on the Shinji front, less so in terms of Light. I'll preface this by saying that I tend to agree with characters who believe the ends justify the means. I loved Kiritsugu through all of Fate/Zero, and IMO Lelouch from Code Geass is one of the most heroic characters in all of anime (which I know sounds weird, but I cared enough to write a whole essay on it at one point). I also don't think Light's ideology is entirely bad in itself. Yeah, it's warped and goes further than I'm ok with with characters of this type, but there's still a clear thread of reason that lead him to it so it's fine. As to the pure evil thing though, I think that Light pretty clearly has some sort of antisocial personality disorder (psychopathy or sociopathy). He exhibits countless textbook signs throughout the show, and I would be legitimately surprised if it turns out that it wasn't intentional. Does that make him a bad character? No. I do think he could have been more interesting if the ethical question of what he was doing had been more of a deal and we had seen more of what was happening to the world rather than spending all of our time focusing on the mind games though.
>> ARTICLE
About Light, give [this essay](http://casuistor.tumblr.com/post/100883210747/prekira) a read if you haven't seen it yet. Some parts might be farfetched but overall I think it's an excellent analysis on how he became the person he is. I don't like calling Light a sociopath because it's a cheap way to justify his actions. Given the right circumstances, anybody can go mad and commit atrocities and Light never showed any significant sociopathic traits before he found the death note or during the yotsuba arc either.

> we had seen more of what was happening to the world rather than spending all of our time focusing on the mind games though.

The last chapter of the manga did have a short scene of a small sect of people that wanted Kira to return, kinda sad the anime didn't adapt that but since they changed the ending slightly I guess it would've made the anime too pro-Light.
>> ARTICLE
This was a very good essay, but I disagree with a few things. Firstly, this point you make: 

>  Light never showed any significant sociopathic traits before he found the death note or during the yotsuba arc either.

From wikipedia: 

* deception, as indicated by repeatedly lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure
* Incapacity to maintain enduring relationships, though having no difficulty in establishing them (his friends from the manga are a good example here, and the women he uses later on really sell this one for me)

And unless you're going to argue that it's an immediate transformation these traits exhibit themselves almost immediately after the discovery of the Death Note (and I would personally guess that it's just because we don't get much time with him beforehand):

* impulsivity or failure to plan ahead (I know this one seems counter to his character since Light spends so much time planning, but when he gets worked up he can also be *very* rash. This could be a result of his increasing hubris and power complex though, so feel free to dismiss this one).
* reckless disregard for safety of self or others
* lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another
* Callous unconcern for the feelings of others
* Very low tolerance to frustration and a low threshold for discharge of aggression
* Incapacity to experience guilt or to profit from experience, particularly punishment (note especially that Light only really freaks out after his first kill, and even then it's more because he's terrified that it actually worked/that he'll get caught)
* Marked readiness to blame others or to offer plausible rationalizations for the behavior that has brought the person into conflict with society. (this one only comes in later on, but worth noting)

Further, this subtype fits him like a glove:

**Reputation-defending:** Needs to be thought of as infallible, unbreakable, invincible, indomitable, formidable, inviolable; intransigent when status is questioned; overreactive to slights. These individuals want to be portrayed as tough and fearless. If his or her reputation is questioned the individual becomes furious and explosive, leading to murders or brutal attacks on people.

Further, if we go to the psychopathy checklist (what's normally used to diagnose), I'll bold the ones that we can be certain apply to Light:

* **glib and superficial charm**
* **grandiose (exaggeratedly high) estimation of self** (though you could argue that this is just because he really is that good)
* need for stimulation
* **pathological lying** (could argue that he has to to maintain his secret)
* **cunning and manipulativeness**
* **lack of remorse or guilt**
* **shallow affect (superficial emotional responsiveness)**
* callousness and lack of empathy (I think so, but if you're arguing for the counterpoint you'd say his actions come from a place of empathy, so we'll leave this one blank).
* parasitic lifestyle
* poor behavioral controls
* sexual promiscuity (not really touched upon in the show)
* early behavior problems
* lack of realistic long-term goals
* **impulsivity**
* irresponsibility
* **failure to accept responsibility for own actions**
* **many short-term marital relationships** (could be argued against, but I would catagorise his manipulation of women later on as this)
* juvenile delinquency
* revocation of conditional release
* **criminal versatility**

So yeah, I'd say there's ample evidence that he could have been a latent psychopath before receiving the Death Note (though nothing 100% conclusive either obviously). Now, all of that aside, on to the actual essay. It makes some excellent points and gives some very plausible alternate explanations to a lot of the traits that Light exhibits that could also be ASPD. These arguments are solid and I think you'd have to be pretty ridiculous to try to refute them. The arguments to the effect that these alternate interpretations are more likely than the psychopathy explanations are on shakier ground though. Many of the points that he *can't* be a psychopath come down to essentially this:

> It would only be beneficial and important to play up the role of perfect son when his interactions are being scrutinized by L and the task force. There is no scrutiny happening here in this scene.

That Light does things for people that he cares about when he would otherwise have nothing to gain. I find that to be kind of shaky as it could also easily be part of his persona, especially since his subset of psychopathy under that interpretation would be one that is very image concerned. When talking about Light's father, this also seems pretty unhelpful to me:

> In other words, their core beliefs on what is just and unjust are (at a baseline in absence of death notes) ultimately the same.

Well of course they are. Ideas don't come from a vacuum and Light was raised with his father as his baseline for success. Obviously to some degree he's going to strive to emulate that, psychopathy or no. Similarly:

> Its interesting that the very first comment Light makes in defense of his own innocence is not logical in nature. Light is appealing to Soichiro as a father, invoking the implicit trust between them. Light feels personally betrayed by Soichiro and it couldnt be more transparent in his expression.

... Or going for the family route is just a better tactic under this circumstance. Feeling betrayed is far more believable than attempting to calmly and logically convince. Again, I'm not saying that his interpretation is necessarily wrong either, it just also doesn't invalidate the possibility of psychopathy in the slightest.

> As expected, Light is again hiding his face and hiding his eyes when Sayu casually announces her disgust with Kira. Again, this visual reinforcement emphasizes the point that theres more than physical avoidance here, its emotional as well. He is betraying the trust of his family, hurting them even, and this is a fact he literally cannot face.

This argument is actually quite compelling though. It's not a smoking gun either, but I'm more inclined to admit it into the pile of evidence to that particular side.

> People who do not have a moral compass and thus dont care about whether their actions are right or wrong  do not spend days agonizing about what theyve done, nor do they have to work so hard to reconcile the discrepancy between their beliefs and their actions.

The panels that this is in reference to can also be attributed to fear.

Anyway, all of that said, it's a pretty awesome theory. I like the idea that his megalomaniacal rants are just showboating for Ryuk, and ultimately I think that under this interpretation he's a far more complex and interesting character. It's probably my new headcannon, but I also still don't think it does a terrific job of invalidating the psychopath argument so much as it just coexists with it as another possibility based on the same given set of evidence. Either way, I don't think Light is a bad character, if you can talk this much about a single aspect of a story it's either got to be good or exceptionally horrendous (and while I do take quite a few issues with other aspects of Death Note, I don't think anything is the latter).

Sorry for the long reply, and I hope it's all coherent. A wave of tiredness hit me halfway through writing it.

Welp I ended up accidentally closing my browser while writing a reply so i'm going to keep it short. 

While you raise some good points there's also others points that could, directly or indirectly, be attributed to the influence of the DN. I'm still not 100% convinced that Light was a sociopath yet however I'm much more open to the theory now.

> Sorry for the long reply, and I hope it's all coherent. A wave of tiredness hit me halfway through writing it.

By no means is it my favorite or close to being my favorite show, but most of my favorites were already chosen, so here's one:


School Days, the characters become unlikable. No shit the characters are unlikable, that's kinda the point. Everyone does stupid fucked up shit, otherwise it would just be another generic harem with nothing unique about it. I also frequently hear that it's totally unrealistic, but it's a high school setting. At least in my experience back in high school, the moral standards weren't exactly sterling either. School days just takes it further and exaggerates everything, but anime is almost always outside the realm of reality so I don't understand why so many people get pissed off that "it's too unrealistic/that could never happen".

Darker than Black is a bad/weak/diluted/whatever Cowboy Bebop clone.

[The guy who had a hand in both the TV series and the movie](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=4143) would obviously be more inspired by it than most, but DtB was always about its detailed worldbuilding, a solid two-act episodic format that played to the strengths of the medium, and a guy and a girl who want to escape a capital-S Syndicate. (I wonder why that last bit sounds familiarhmm couldn't be)

I never liked CB as much as others did, and a film major friend basically explained it to me as being "all surface" which made a lot of sense, since sometimes a space cowboy is just a space cowboy. Leitmotifs, distinct character arcs, allegorical motifs, narratives that reflect the themes, visual storytellingI always felt like DtB was Okamura's improvisation of what he felt were the shortcomings of CB, and he succeeded in that regard.

not the second season though, fuck that. Shikkoku no Hana will always be the real S2 in my heart.

Coming from a VN reader, UBW's ending regarding [spoiler](/s "Archer") was very much an ass pull, and one that you can't even explain.

Mirai Nikki, a whole lot of things.  
  
**Yukki is a bad character.** He's a world-tier pussy, sure. However it's highly justified. That doesn't make him, "Bad".  
  
**You got to turn your brain off to enjoy it.** No you don't, if you go actively searching for shit to criticize, you're going to find it and that's what I feel a lot of people do.  
  
**It's filled with plot-holes.** Even critically acclaimed shows have plot holes, it's unfortunate but true. However I know of only a tiny handful of **Legitimate** plot holes for MN. Whenever someone criticizes for this, they never elaborate so I may be totally wrong, however I know of only a few.  
  
One of the few criticisms I'll give ground on is the similarity between Yukki/Shinji and Akise/Kaworu because it honestly is very similar. However that is not nearly a large enough plot point for me to honestly give too much of a shit about.  
  
Edit: Knew this shit would happen. If you disagree actually respond so we can debate, the downvoting only makes my case better since you won't justify any of your actions.

To be fair some shows are so filled with problems that I almost feel I need to be lobotomized to enjoy it. If its something that's supposed to be a bit crazy that's fine but if its something that I'm supposed to be taking seriously I'd rather it keep nonsense to a minimum. 

Its true that even the best shows can have plot-holes but It depends on the size and frequency of them. If every ep of a show I'm treated to complete bs even if I'm supposed to be talking it seriously then I'm not gonna hold it in very high regard.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no I understand that completely, however either I'm ignorant of the superfluous amounts of plot-holes in MN or people are simply over-exaggerating badly.  
  
My money is on the latter as very few times have I seen anyone actually list true plot holes and they simply say, "It has a shitload of plotholes" and it ends there.

I was mostly speaking about anime in general. I haven't watched MN in a while so I can't comment to much but every now and then you get wanna be critics that echo what they've seen or heard from others so they sound smart, It could have plot-holes out the ass for all I know but god knows they can't point them out.

That's a good point in all honestly, however her opinion of him heavily fluctuates based on what he does. She gives him shit all day and treats him like a bitch in the beginning but [Black Lagoon](/s "Once he stands up to her and tells her to fuck off she changes her attitude.")

I'm there with you. IRL the only time I cry is when I get like this angry cry thing going. When I'm yelling at someone, mainly when I know them well or personally, I will cry.

Fairly positive I saw them mostly on your posts, that pink flair makes you stand out like a sore thumb.

You don't even understand how embarrassing it is. 5'11" decently built dude who looks a bit older than his age fucking ending in tears while screaming his ass off in an argument.... it's not fun. I wish I could just have K-On gifs there to keep me cool haha

yeah i  went into the fate series without any knowledge of what would happen and  caster being introduced is still one of the most WTF moments for me.

Care to elaborate? I'm about to go into this series (and also trying to decide whether to start with Zero or Stay Night).

I still need to rewatch Texhnolyze sometime, but man it was fucking hard watching through the first time.

I was relatively fine until the finale. Good god, that finale....

I just wanted to curl up into a fetal position and quietly die. 


Then that music came on, and I curled up into a fetal position. 
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Texchnolyze but I just couldn't finish the first episode. I made it about half way. I had no idea what I was watching it and I never heard any dialogue.
>> ARTICLE
Speech is silver, silence is golden.

Well, it's atmosphere building, to get a feel for the city and the setting our characters are in(dry, lifeless, used, hopeless). But I don't blame you, this show isn't particularly recommendable because it is by no means entertaining or even enjoyable, until much later on with a few action scenes, and events with actual dialogue.

It's not just a joke that the 1st episode has *only 10 lines of dialogue*.
>> ARTICLE
So sad I'll become an alcohol? Looks like this one's going on my watch list.

God I love this show so much.

It's, for me, the perfect dystopia, the dystopiest of dystopias. And I love the feeling and vibe it gives of.

I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi and this series was a big inspiration for me in terms of atmosphere and feeling when I wrote my first short-story.

This anime really gives you a taste of depression, which is beautiful in its own way.

I've never been so shocked at an ending.

Yeah the anime is based on the arc that tells you why we are supposed to hate Griffith. And it even covers up a large portion of the gore/more sensitive scenes. I would recommend you read the manga if you havent but I wouldn't want anyone to go through that again

[MANGA BERSERK SPOILERS](/s "Over time I had lost track of why I hated Griffith. The new current ark isn't helping in that though.

Just got caught up in the manga after nearly a decade hiatus of reading it. Its gotten so good. Its a shame we'll probably never see another anime adaptation.

[The entire back half of Steins;Gate](/s "gets dark and heavy on the feels.  Mayuri's first death was more shocking than outright sad, but everything Okabe and the others go through after that point starts to wear on me - in a good way, I guess - as a viewer.")

[There's Faris](/s "having a mini-breakdown as her memories from the other world-line seep into the line where she prevented her father from dying 10 years ago and then resigning to return to that world line to save Mayuri.")

[Suzuha's initial](/s "failed - failed, failed, failed, failed - attempt to get the IBN for the FGL and then the team finds out that she hung herself.")

[Mayuri remembering](/s "every time she's died and writing it off as dreams.")

[All of that leads up to](/s "the point where I'm not ashamed to admit I completely lost it: After Okabe has exhausted every possible alternative to save both Mayuri and Kurisu, he undoes the final D-Mail and Daru deletes the record from SERN's servers.  Kurisu bursts into the room with her declaration of love for Okabe only to be cut off as the lab returns to a world-line in which she's dead.  Then, for the sake of his team, Okabe tries to play everything off through his Mad Scientist Persona as if nothing is wrong while he's tearing up and can't even look at them, prompting the always-deceptively-insightful Mayuri to say something to the effect of: It's okay, you can cry now.")

I don't know why people don't mention it more often, [but when] (/s "Mr. Braun committed suicide, the cycle of despair had become so devastating to me at that point that I knew this series would always have a deep emotional impact on me. God, now I wanna rewatch it again.")
>> ARTICLE
The only thing sad about that [was that](/s "they kept cutting to Nae alone at home.")

[Moeka had](/s "already earned evil bitch status so I really didn't feel too bad for her even after the show wanted me to pity her, but then it turns out that Braun was the 'real villain' and probably had every intention of killing her after her mission regardless of circumstance.  I couldn't give a damn about that world-line's Braun if I tried.")

To my knowledge, this unfolds very [differently in the VN:](/s "Braun kills himself (and not Moeka) in order to break the chain of command so that Moeka can live and slip off of SERN's radar.")  Now _that_ would have gotten me a little misty if the anime had followed suit.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps it wasn't entirely sad, but this post is about emotional breakdown, and as the viewer observes Okabe's world meltdown, I found that scene depressing in terms of how Okabe would have to live with that experience. 
>> ARTICLE
Ruka's episode broke me. Everything was just... perfect when born the way they wanted. That feeling of being normal, that feeling of being able to just be yourself, express yourself,  say what you feel and not be... hated or rejected or make someone uncomfortable just by being you. That hit me hard. I don't think I'd have given it up in her position. I wouldn't be able to go back.

Same.  Hit way too close to home for me.  I felt like someone punched through my chest and left my heart hanging out my back.

But it did start me on the path to getting over it, growing up, and finally moving on - so in that respect, I am thankful for the experience.

It's amazing how you can just put your issues into a box, lock them away in a corner, and live life as if the whole thing never happened - until one day something like this comes along, reminds you that yes it did, and tells you frankly to get over it because it's destroying you from the inside out.
>> ARTICLE
My heart is with you. I hope everything gets healed to the point where you find your happiness of the past. 
>> ARTICLE
So powerful. No other anime I have seen has been as visually detailed and true to life as this movie. It is harder to dismiss emotionally because it contains no fantastical elements or 2D characters. The ending caught me a bit off guard and and absolutely crushed me.
>> ARTICLE
I just watched it and there are so many things abouts this movie that I want to talk about. I am currently in a very bad spot in my life, suffering from depression and anxiety issues, and this movie really gave rise to mixed feelings. Trying to ignore your problem numbs every feeling you have, good and bad. But fighting through all the pain and sadness that you have saved up in your life, sometimes just brings you to your knees. 

To want something from the bottom of your heart but being afraid to act upon it because of shame, fear and doubts is something that i think everyone can relate to. To have the courage to tell someone that you love them or even need them, even though you know the feeling most likely is shared is far from easy to obtain. What if you were wrong? What if they are lying? What if feelings change? 

""Even now i still love you". That's what the girl I'd been with for three years said in that e-mail. But I'm sure that even if we had written 1000 text messages back and forth, our hearts probably wouldn't have moved even 1 centimeter closer. Over these past few years, I've only wanted to move forward and touch that which i couldn't reach, though I've never been able to tangibly define what it was." 

This is something I have spent a lot of time thinking about recently. To connect with someone, "to move your hearts closer", is the most fulfilling feeling in the entire world. To feel understood, needed, wanted, loved for who you are. But however close you get to someone, there is always a gap. There will always be a need for more, because no one can understand you completely. In the end, you are alone with your feelings, and that is scarier than almost anything in my opinion. 

There are moments in your life where you connect, to take an example from the film, the moment they kissed. They were there in the same "sphere" of emotions, but when they "disconnect", things get weird. You try to get it back, to grasp for the other person you just felt, but it's gone. 

I probably seem like a nutcase to most people right now, but at the moment I don't really care, people who wanted to read will keep reading. Normally I would never bother writing these things because of what I mentioned just now. People wont get it. People don't care. No matter what words I use, these feelings are my own to experience, and you can only give people a small taste of your true feelings at best. So why bother? The only way to keep trying is to keep believing and hoping, even though it seems impossible.

That was actually what we were intended to feel with Grave of the Fireflies, which wasn't meant to be an anti-war movie despite most thinking it was.

Here's a quote of Director Takahata's on the movie, taken from the Grave of the Fireflies Wiki page:

>"[The film] is not at all an anti-war anime and contains absolutely no such message." Instead, Takahata had intended to convey an image of the brother and sister living a failed life due to isolation from society and invoke sympathy particularly in people in their teens and twenties, whom he felt needed to straighten up and respect their elders for the pain and suffering they had experienced during arguably the darkest point in Japan's history.

Don't read even beyond this sentence if you haven't seen Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, because I don't want to spoiler tag paragraphs. Also, it's like seven years old at this point. Statute of limitations has expired.

TTGL remains, to me, one of the greatest injustices I've ever had to witness in fiction. That motherfucker sacrificed and lost so much for her. He spent years of his life with her, and they were together, and they were happy, and the *very day* he asks her to marry him, not only does she say no (technically), she becomes his enemy. Or rather, she is taken by his enemy, made to be his enemy. He has to fight *against* her in order to *save* her. 
But she resists that control. Her love for him is so strong that it literally reach across galaxies. How much strength of will must it have taken for her to just wear that little ring? Once they saw that there was hope, neither one of them could be made to surrender. Simon cross the universe for Nia. He battled against overwhelming odds physically, mentally, and emotionally. He fought harder and sacrificed more. Lifelong friends of his gave up their lives for the sake of the human race, and for their friend's love.
Throughout all this, Nia was blind to it. She had no reason not to, but she never, not for one second, even *considered* that Simon might not come to her. The slightest doubt could have destroyed the link between them, but it never did. Because she resisted the taunts and the illusions of her abductors with unwavering confidence.
And finally, they are united. The power of their union beats back the anti-spiral, that which would have destroyed the entire species. They return to their home as heroes. She accepts his proposal and they get married. He slips that ring that kept the connected through the light-years onto her finger

and then it falls to the ground. He doesn't even have a corpse left to embrace. She'd only just become his wife. There wasn't even a reception. She didn't throw the bouquet. They didn't have a first dance. She kissed him and said good-bye, and then she was gone.

That's the thanks they get. Simon's raw energy and drive that carried him through dimensions, that indescribable power that beat back every overwhelmingly superior force and saved not only the love of his life, not only his planet, but even countless other races he didn't even existed. Nia's unwavering belief, regardless of what she was shown or made to see, no matter what she was told or made to believe, no matter how she was coerced, controlled, or used, never even flickered -that unerring *certainty* that the man she loved could and *would* win every battle he fought to get to her. 

What do they get for it? They never see each other again. Nia is all but erased from existence and Simon simply... remains. He walks away and never walks back. Decades spent with only a rodent for company, while his former allies forge a new universe. The show ends with this larger-than-larger-than-life hero reduced to a dirty old man being ignored by a thirsty child, looking up at the sky that he all but *conquered* while other take strolls down paths that he nearly died creating.

Sorry for the text, I had a hit earlier and I'm still at like a 4. Once I started, it kind of just kept happening.

A lot of bad shit happened in my real life the day before I started the show, and while watching it I started to feel better and forget about those problems. Then I made the fatal mistake of watching those last OVA episodes. I felt so betrayed.

Honestly i dont think that that is so bad. It is certainly a bummer with how a certain character was shafted and that there was a time skip... but honestly id be fine with it. I mean they get happy endings anyway. It is not as satisfying as the anime ending but i woudnt exactly call the ln ending trash(assuming that post is accurate).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I remember it being way worse. Maybe it was the way someone described it to me. But yeah I wouldn't like that to be an animated season. They should make an original ending.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... I think I managed to somehow convince myself that the LN was a fanfic and anime is the original thing, with more and deeper character development, as well as better ending, humor and romance aspects.

Well I heard even the parts the anime adapted were worse even in the LN, so it's possible they could turn even the shitty LN ending into something good.

Clannad AS wrecked me inside. However I have felt one thing worse, not sure if it counts but the Amane's route of Grisaia VN destroyed me inside. I literally stayed up all night playing it and cannot get over how twisted it got towards the end. I was trembling, I dunno if its from depression or shock.
>> ARTICLE
Would you recommend to read the other routes first before starting/finishing Amane's route?
>> ARTICLE
Go for makina's first, there's a lot of references between them (amane's and makina's).
>> ARTICLE
I'm only part way through my second route now, this literally happened yesterday. Amane's was quite the spectacular route, I'd recommend it but I've heard Makina's is the most impactful. So my personal choice has been to save that one for last.
>> ARTICLE
Is the anime at all faithful to Amane's route in the VN?
>> ARTICLE
Just finished the VN yesterday, and I gotta say, what a ride. Easily spent 50 hours into that thing and enjoyed every second. Amanes route hit me the hardest out of all of them. Michirus and Yumikos good ending were by far the sweetest, with Sachi and Amanes routes being very "chained" so to speak. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole VN and makinas route definitely showed alot of Yuujis past and really expanded on the group mentality more than the other routes, which mostly involved the heroine and Yuuji as soon as the route started. I personally cannot pick a favorite route yet, because they each have so many good points to them. Its such a ride and youll regret it when its over, take it easy lol.

That being said, have a great time with it because I sure did!
>> ARTICLE
..I should play this.

If you want to die inside go for it. I played Amane's backstory start to end in one sitting, I stayed up all night and couldn't even sleep after. You're welcome to experience my hell but I would strongly advise you go in with your emotional barriers up

From what I've heard the VN is more emotionally impactful, however can't say for certain as I haven't seen the anime adaption.
>> ARTICLE
I have watched the anime and read 2/5 routes in the VN. The anime has SERIOUS pacing issues that the novel didn't have. The VN can make you feel really messed up, the anime is basically the same feelings but in way smaller doses.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, I hear the same from a good friend who's making his way though the VN. He keeps trying to get me to check it out but I'm really not into VN's at all, so it'll go unread for me. [Grasia Ep 11 Spoiler](/s "after that poor dog died in episode 11, they bashed in its head, skinned it, and all ate it (including it's owner who just cried the whole time) I was seriously rekt.

VNs are an acquired taste. I use to not like them all that much, my first experience was Fate Stay Night, which I played for about an hour a day. After a while my mind kinda adapted to it and was reading them for about 6-8 hours at a time.

That episode left me speechless and just repeating "what!? what!? what!?" for the at least 20 minutes and re-watching it as my eyes might be deceiving me

I have never felt so angry at an anime before.
>> ARTICLE
Especially when you think about the setting. Millions dead, senselessly killed by a combination of a cowardly government that clung to an outdated system of government and used racism to maintain their power, and a madman who felt that countless lives were a worthy price to pay for his revenge. And there was no justice. No peace. The war rages on, and the fuckwads who caused it all are in all likelihood alive and well.

For me it was Anohana, because of the ending mostly. I had a tendency to watch the opening, and since I watched a review of it beforehand, I felt a little more for Menma, but I utterly could not handle to massive explosion of emotion at the end. 

To be honest, it was really the only one to make groundbreaking feels trip for me in terms of anime, anyway. Anything else was VN. And only one ever came close to the feels Ive gotten from Anohana.

Not sure if it was mentioned already but Neon Genesis Evangelion.
I finished the series + End of Evangelion and went to bed straight after - empty, sad and not knowing what to do. Slept not really well that night, woke up and remained their curled up like an embryo for like 2 hours and couldn't really do much besides staying alive. I stayed like this for atleast two days before getting the urge to do something again.. Man, this series got me.

There were still some others shows that made me really sad and almost cry myself to sleep (e.g. Angel Beats!) but yeah, NGE just broke me mentally.

End of Evangelion.

I binge watched the series by renting some DVDs from my library (was shocked they had them) a few years ago and watched the EoE film over a weekend.

There were a few scenes that got to me, the hospital scene, [The scene in the basement](/s "With the Ayanami clones") 

And then the last line in the ending scene. It was largely to do with the way it was translated. [the final line](/s "Kimochi Warui, which was translated in the DVD I had to: "How Disgusting" after Asuna reaches up to touch Shinji's face. Looking back it can be interpreted different ways as her tone and actions weren't of disgust, and it could mean 'I feel sick'") But impressionable 17 year old me was pretty screwed up as a result of that last line. The implications of the ending, coupled with that final line made me feel sick inside, and I couldn't watch anything for a week. That whole weekend I just felt dead. That was some powerful stuff.

I'm hesitant to watch the re:builds because of my experiences now haha, I've gotten up to 2.0, but I'll wait for the 4th to see the last 2 together.

Only two anime have broken me:

The Dog of Flanders: A somewhat obscure anime that I picked up as a kid. I had never read/watched any other version of the Dog of Flanders, and had absolutely no idea what it was about. Much tears were had.

Wolf's Rain: Those last four episodes. I don't even. There was not a shred of happiness to be found.

I bawled my eyes out during the last episode.

None, seems like I am cold hearted as fuck....

Only 5 cm per second touched me, but it certainly didn't emotionally break me.

Ok spoilers for Fate Stay Night 2006 and Kara no Kyoukai.

So i finished FSN recently and knowing that it's based on visual novel i suspected that it would have happy ending with shiro marying saber or something like that. And i know that Type-Moon properties usualy don't have happy tone but Kara no Kyoukai had happy ending. So i was expecting at least that in FSN ending. So it truly hit me that Shiro can't be with saber and even if saber will be ever summoned again she will not have memories of this world.

I'm reading though Visual novel to look for happy ending for saber and shiro but i'm afraid it will make me sad again.
>> ARTICLE
I played the VN first, and the ending of the fate route killed me inside. It was already painful enough when [fate](/s "she disappeared at the temple"), then they give you some nice happy moments before going [fate](/s "back to Saber in her own times with Bedivere which was the worst.")

Gurren Lagann

I watched this show shortly after an incredibly depressing event in my life that I'd rather not get into and I could relate almost directly to Simon. I didn't watch anything for a good two months and it magnified whatever sadness I had at least tenfold. Less breaking and more absolutely destroying me. Fun times
>> ARTICLE
Nothing has wrecked me as of yet.  The strongest emotional reactions I've had came from 5cm Per Second (I can relate to that whole story so much) and Welcome to the NHK (again, because I can relate to certain elements).  I am very emotionally flat though, so the small reactions that I had should not be brushed aside either.  Getting shivers is kind of big for me, and not common.  Both 5cm and NHK managed to give me shivers.

Anohana and Angel Beats

DO watch them. The void is a pretty good feeling in hindsight. 

I kinda like it. 

It's even better when it's coupled with emotional breaking. Makes you feel like you've watched the greatest thing ever, greater than your previous "greatest thing you've ever watched". 

Felt like that for Clannad. Did not regret a single moment of it.

Wrecked me? The one that absolutely wrecked me was SaiKano. I couldn't watch anime for a month after and the depression leaked over into my real life.

Tokyo magnitude 8.0. I didn't expect that ending at all. I was covered in tears by the last episode. The pain in my chest was like no other. I have siblings so I couldn't even fathom the pain Mirai felt. 
>> ARTICLE
The one I'll remember forever is the Accelerator vs. [](/s "Misaka sister") fight at the docks in the Sisters arc (Railgun S aka Railgun season 2).

The writers did such a great job [](/s "humanizing her. They really made you love and empathize with a character that's at a first glance emotionless. You get to see her develop her own humanity. Then that long, drawn out fight, sustaining injury after injury, and then her leg getting pulled off. What the fuck. And later killed, crushed by a container. All of this contrasted with the original Misaka falling apart because of what she's witnessing - all for an "experiment" with the knowledge that it will have to be repeated again and again. Ultimate innocence vs. inhuman cruelty. ").

I felt like shit for weeks after seeing that. I still get a sinking feeling in my stomach just remembering it. 

[](/s "For some reason quite a few people in this sub like Accelerator, but I don't understand it.  I just want to see him tossed into a singularity - to make sure he doesn't reflect his way out of it."). 

Maybe it affected me the most because I didn't expect it. At all. My impression of the show was that it was harmless fun with a little bit of action. The first half of Railgun season one (Level Upper arc) was pretty much [](/s "vanilla action with any of the darker undertones mostly off screen or implied; the second half was cutesy SoL stuff.") I didn't watch Index beforehand so I had no idea what was going to happen. Or how far it would go. 

I've seen my fair share of tearjerkers (including many from the replies in this thread), but nothing could top this for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Along with th others mentioned (Clannad, S;G, 5cm/s.) For me, what broke me for a whole week is White Album 2. The imperfections of each character along with their collective will of friendship just leads to such a heartbreaking tragedy.

NHK ni youkoso didn't necessarily break me but it made me feel distraught as i have felt lonely for long periods of life and have preferred to live in almost complete isolation at one point.

I think I need to look up one of these emotionally breaking animes, 'cause I feel like I'm missing out on something.

The Oreimo S2 OVA's. To be fair though, I haven't watched any really sad anime (like Anohana or Clannad) and since it was one of the first anime I watched I was way more emotionally invested in the characters than many other shows. At that point in time I really only watched one show at a time, so I devoted all my time and interest into it, and marathoning a show I guess gave it more of a single experience, vs. airing shows which I watch multiple of over a long time.

Honestly, none.

Maybe I just havn't watched enough shows with sad endings, maybe i'm just an emotionless husk of a person ^^^^^not ^^^^^too ^^^^^far ^^^^^off but when you recognise that these are fake characters, you really end up not feeling anything too sad from it.

That said, that doesn't mean I don't feel bad for the charachers per say, but it's more of a "Oh, that sucks, sorry" kind of thing, and not a "OMG THIS IS THE SADDEST THING EVERRRRRRR ;_; \*Tears*" deal.

None. I mean, I've felt sad and cried from anime before, but none where I was sad for a long time or drove me into depression.. I've seen quite a few fucked up things, react to it (shock/sad) for a few minutes and move on. Nothing "broke" me.
>> ARTICLE
Btw, is white album 2 a standalone anime or would I have to watch white album 1? I've been interested in watching this also. 
>> ARTICLE
Standalone. From what I know its different stories completely. If you do end up watching it just know to look up the graphic novel endings afterward. They make it a little more bearable. 
>> ARTICLE
The ending of Elfen Lied tore me apart emotionally

I don't even remember why, but it did
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Stay Night (2006). I don't like farewells :(
>> ARTICLE
The most I've ever done is shed a couple tears of sadness and enjoyment. However, some animes make me so mad that I literally stop watching any anime for months because of them.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad 
>> ARTICLE
Lets see...obligatory angel beats (duh!) and Kakumeiki Valvrave, the ending was surprising, the OPs and EDs for valvrave made it much more harder :(

Yeah I had the exact same reaction to white album 2. I don't enjoy literature that makes me sad but I feel you bro.

Clannad: After Story episode 21 and 22. Nearly every arc gets me going but those two episodes tear my heart out and build me back up, especially 21. 
>> ARTICLE
After watching neon genesis I had to take a break from all anime. Then wolf's rain collapsed into a mess 2 minutes after finishing the series.  Then watched school days. Threw a chair across the room while standing up for the last two episodes. Then toradora which I was a babbling mess after finishing it.

School Days. Had few nightmares after that.

[Honey and Clover](/s "I kept going episode after episode, season after season expecting him to get the girl. Instead all I got was an emotional rollercoaster ;_;")

5cm per second ;-;
>> ARTICLE
I could list obvious ones, like anything produced by Key. But the one show that just left me with an empty feeling was Sora no Woto. What made it worse was reading about how so many people who worked on it desperately wanted to make a second season.
>> ARTICLE
For me it was Welcome to the NHK. Especially the last episode. When all was said and done and the ending "Madokashii sekai no ue de" (on top of a frustrating world) kicked in, I really lost it.

I shed tears over Meruem and Komugi at the end of the ant arc in HxH.

Little Busters! was one of the only animes that broke me. Never teared up so much on any shows I watched!

It would be 5 Centimeters per Second (Byousoku 5 Centimeter) and Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, i was pretty young when i first saw Angel Beats and the ending broke me, i cried for hours.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely Kanon. Each arc transitions from cheerful to tragic in such a perfect way.

Especially during [Makoto's arc] (/s "when you have to watch her mind and body slowly deteriorate, to the point she can no longer talk anymore.")
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's not the kind of emotional breaking you're talking about, but I had to take a long, hard look in the mirror near the end of Shinsekai Yori. I wasn't sure what had become of me when I was [shouting at my screen,](/s "cheering squealer on for trying to use a kidnapped, brainwashed child to murder an entire civilization. I guess what I'm trying to say is: Squealer did nothing wrong.")

Death Note. I was never so destroyed... yes I was late to the anime club but after Death Note. I was utterly devastated. I mean horribly depressed and everyone saw it. Everyone was so worried until I told them it was because of an anime.
I still get destroyed when I think about it. I listen to the soundtrack daily. Literally daily one of the greatest soundtracks if not thee greatest.
Kodoku always give me the feels.
Any recommendations for other animes thatll destroy me?
>> ARTICLE
If Death Note broke you? Try Fate/Zero.
>> ARTICLE
I did. Couldnt get into it.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK. 

Thankfully, it didn't ring *too* close to me, but holy shit the later half of that show wrecked me.

[The "Suicide Pact" episode(s) were devastating. They held off on actually killing any of the characters, only to have an even sadder second-half where they all went to the resort. ](/spoiler)

[Also, the last episode, holy shit man.  ](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
[Tokyo Ghoul huge manga spoilers](/s "The last few chapters of TG destroyed me emotionally and I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. The fact that Kaneki went to such lengths just to protect his friends because he was so sick of being alone. Then to get completely smacked down by Arima really messed with my head. 
And now we've got Haise in :re who is just ripe for more suffering, especially since he's met the anteiku crew and possibly Tsukiyama again")
>> ARTICLE
**Hunter X Hunter** dumped me into an emotion-filled ocean throughout the Chimera Ant arc. It gives the viewer just a flurry of different reasons to be affected by its storytelling. Because of the absurdly detailed character writing you understand each character's personality, needs, and relationships. This all leads to a level of viewer empathy that is so very rare in not only the shounen genre, but anime as a medium. There are so many episodes and monologues that I could point out to demonstrate this, and I really hope that everybody will eventually give this show a try. The finale for Chimera Ant was legitimately the very first episode of anime to ever make me cry, and I've watched Clannad AS, TTGL, Bebop, and Anohana (all of which are great in their own ways).
>> ARTICLE
Probably Madoka and Higurashi

There's tragedies, and then there's watching the horrible spiral of death and despair that these two shows had.

I attribute most of it to their pacing though. And things did not outstay their welcome.

Also the fingernail scene in Higurashi. Ugggghhhhh... That shit makes me shiver. 
>> ARTICLE
Akame ga Kill is breaking me. All the deaths D:
>> ARTICLE
Toradora. Anyone who has seen Toradora will understand the emotional torment the last couple episodes are. Everytime I here the Lost My Pieces soundtrack I bite into a pillow to hold back the man tears.
>> ARTICLE
Wolf children, in a lot of moments... The first anime to make me physically cry :( I just went and hugged my mom afterwards. 
>> ARTICLE
As much as I love Clannad and Clannad After Story and how it got me emotionally, I have to say Kanon by KyoAni really broke me. Especially the Makoto arc. Still, when I think about it, I cry about it. It doesn't happen with Clannad because there's hope. Kanon just broke me emotionally.
>> ARTICLE
The few episodes in Haruhi where they kept playing the 2 weeks. It wasn't that it was sad or anything, it broke me because fuck can we just get through this already! I actually dropped it for awhile when I realized it was going to happen again.
>> ARTICLE
kind of late but oh well. Before I was hardcore into anime as I am now, I watched shonen and battle and humor anime because I liked that stuff then I decided to watch Clannad AS because it was on netflix (season 1 was not on so I watched season 2 first).  I was so used to funny anime non serious anime that when that certain part came up, I couldn't handle it, I just layed in my bed for hours thinking of what could have been.  After I finished the series that is when I started watching more anime like that.  But yeah Clanned AS completely broke my heart.
>> ARTICLE
NHK, definitely. I could relate to way too many things in that anime...
>> ARTICLE
Now and Then, Here and There. It broke me and put me back together just so it could break me again. 
>> ARTICLE
Well,not necessarily the entire anime, but certain moments in various anime.

Anohana: The entire series was heartbreaking. Good Lord, those feels.

OreImo: [](/s "Kuroneko's breakdown after Kyousuke rejected her in the S2 OVAs was heartbreaking. I'm not even a huge Kuroneko fan, but that scene just broke my heart.")

AnoNatsu: [](/s "EP9's (?) depiction of the other love triangle members (Mio, Tetsuro, Kanna). Tetsuro comforting Kanna, and Mio hiding and crying behind the shed.... ;(. Ichika's departure was also pretty painful." )

5cm Per Sec [] (/s "The whole anime was sad. In particular, Kanae getting her heart broken.")

Fate/Zero [] (/s "Despair everywhere")

Angel Beats

Air TV

>> ARTICLE
a part  of me really wants to watch all these animes, but i know all ill probably do is go cry in a corner afterwards... **akame ga kill** just killed me today.... i wana die
>> ARTICLE
OreImo broke me. I do not really know how, but god damn it sure did break me for 2 weeks.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the only one who felt a great sense of loss with *every freaking episode* of **Nagi no Asukara**. There was possibly one episode that *didn't* make me cry, and the feelings got more intense as I went. For some reason, their feelings cut right through my heartstrings rather than just playing with them.

Regardless, I couldn't watch more than one a week, especially once I got to the last handful. **10/10 Cannot watch again**.
>> ARTICLE
Anohana for me. Truly it was the first anime that really got me to watch it it all in one day. When it ended I couldn't stop thinking/choking up about it.
>> ARTICLE
Not really an anime just yet, but when I first read Amane's chapter in Grisaia no Kajitsu, I had a minor breakdown. I started reading it at, like, 11 PM and just could not stop. The sun was up by the time I finished Angelic Howl, and I looked at the clock and I just called my mom. I called her and asked her to tell me that everything is okay.

My preexisting depressive tendencies may have had something to do with this, but I was very affected by that story.
>> ARTICLE
Grave of the fireflies and possibly 5 Cm per second. I enjoy sad or emotional scenes in movies as i feel they make the end outcome feel all that much better. That said those 2 movies broke me in a way where i can never watch them again. They were far too depressing for me.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, there are a few:

* The first work of fiction to ever get me to cry was the ending to Digimon Tamers. I know there are a lot of Digimon fans here who know the scene I'm talking about.

* Madoka was the second work of fiction to do this. What really got me was [Madoka](/s "how Madoka's little brother still remembered her.")

* As somebody who *loves* food, Kaneki's plight and the moral ambiguity of what it takes for him to survive as a Ghoul hit me really hard. 

* Say what you will about Valvrave, but the ending (excluding the epilogue) was amazingly executed and very tragic. "You're my friend," indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK...

I actually think it helped contribute to the depression I suffered during the time I watched it (obviously I can't confirm that).

Although I'm not depressed anymore, whenever I think of NHK, the nostalgia of that show greatly overshadows any of the other events that were happening in my life at the time. It's the same reason that listening to the soundtrack makes me cry (yet strangely is also somewhat motivating).

Also a very good show to demonstrate the "anime is for kids" stereotype is bullshit.


>> ARTICLE
I got completely rekt by Welcome to the NHK!
>> ARTICLE
Honestly Anohana was the only anime that fully broke me. After the last episode I was straight balling for about 30 minutes or so.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica, Steins;Gate, Code Geass, Nana.

But still, i think anything can beat Tokyo Babylon (the manga). That manga and his continuation killed me.
>> ARTICLE
Anohana, Cowboy Beebop, Code Geass
>> ARTICLE
I'd have to say 5cm per second or clannad after story 
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero & Fate/Stay Night left me numb for a couple days.

Sora No Otoshimono has a lot of feels to it. Especially the latest movie. Holy fuck I just about cried. My eyes watered and I felt it coming. 
>> ARTICLE
I dont know if anyone has read the visual novel Grisaia no Kaijitsu. The whole thing is an a-bomb of feelings, but there are some moments that that tore me up. In the Sachi route where she, for the first time in years, wanted to be a little bit selfish and grabs Yuuji's shirt. As someone who struggles a lot with anxiety and depression, her story made me feel better and worse, at the same time, than I ever had in years. The anime dont do this VN justice AT ALL. The pacing is WAAAY off. If anyone wants an experience way beyond the anime, i recommend Grisaia.

[Sword Art Online](/s "When Asuna dies to save Kirito in the first season first arc. All I could think was "no way, this can't happen". That shit hit me in the heart and hard")

Also Guilty Crown broke me in a different way because it had amazing animation, an amazing premise, amazing music, amazing side characters and the world's worst written protagonist/most unsatisfying conclusion of all time.
>> ARTICLE
100% agree with you on Guilty Crown
>> ARTICLE
I think something is wrong with me, but ive seen Clannad AS, Guilty crown, and 5CM per second, angel beats, code geas... the effect only lasted an hour or two at the most... <.< >.>

I loved the anime, I guess it was just difficult for me to grow attach to the characters in a way that would seriously emotionally move me...

School days. That anime release years if suppressed anger as I was watching it. The end made it all better though. Cant believe that was the first anime to make me feel something.

For me White Album 2 was also the one who broke me. I was a big fan of touma kazusa very early on and her story just crumbled me.
>> ARTICLE
White Album 2 hit me pretty hard 
>> ARTICLE
The ending of Berserk kind of made me really depressed.  "But the manga....!!!"  Yeah, fuck yourself with your backwards comic books.  The *anime* ended and didn't get a second season.  It really made me hate life in general.  Even the movies, which continued a bit after the series did, still didn't end on a much happier note.
>> ARTICLE
You don't see it mentioned often for emotionally debilitating, but Katanagatari took a number on me. 
>> ARTICLE
Anohana because of all the friendships that fell apart and how the protagonist copes (and fails to cope) with everything.  It mirrors and parallels my life as a NEET coupled with my depression and anxiety.

Clannad..  so much cried..

I saw Eva and Madoka Magica back to back. I felt broken for about a week. The worse thing is I saw them during finals and regents week.

My-HiME, it was one of the first anime I watched in my teens and I'd never experienced even slightly distressing scenes in any kind of tv show or movie I had watched before.

The only true way to watch Neon Genesis Evangelion is all at once, 26 episodes and the movies. Maybe "broken" isn't the best word to describe it, it's more of an ["empty"](http://i.imgur.com/IxrsHJG.gif) feeling.

So, yea, these comments are breaking me again. Thanks guys (and gals).

Angel Beats, Eureka Seven, and Clannad After Story all shattered my heart to bits. I'm sure ya'll can agree.

Ok, I'm old, so with a grain of salt here my pick for end the day I'm so done "wrecked" has to be Eureka Seven. I just hear storywriter play and bam, waterworks. Thanks for bringing those feels back, Netflix... Yuki Yuna is a hero is a close runner up this year though. Hit me in the feels for the last four episodes.

I watched SAO II as they released episodes, as a bit of a preface.
Around the time they were finishing up the last filler arc before MR, people were saying to fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a feels trip. So I went in with that in mind.

Did really well throughout the arc, [Massive Spoilers] (/s "up until the last two episodes when Yuuki is dying, and Asuna rushes into the game to meet her at the tree. When Nori breaks down mid-sentence, I broke even harder than I already was. I made sure I was all alone when I watched that, so my heaves and sobs wouldn't draw attention.")

I was in the middle of watching GitS, SAC: 2nd gig when that happened. I was maybe 2-3 episodes shy of finishing that series, and I didn't watch another show period for like 3 weeks.

Reading other peoples' reactions, and I must be some heartless monster. I didn't feel anything watching TTGL or FMA:B during that one scene everyone bring sup.
>> ARTICLE
Without a doubt felt like I lost a piece of my soul with phantom requiem for a phantom...just dark soooooo dark.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with many moments mentioned here, so I have to be original.

I finished the 2 seasons of `sword art online` and the end of season 2 moved me hard. I'm sure you know what I mean. The scene on the tiny island and the single tree...
>> ARTICLE
Definitely AnoHana for me. Wrecked me and still wrecks me. Also anything pertaining to Sasuke and Itachi for Naruto. 
>> ARTICLE
It was a few honestly.

Anohana wrecked me at the end.  

Watched Clannad, Clannad After Story and Angel Beats in a span of 3 days if I recall.

I don't want to do that to myself again ;-; took a good two weeks before I could watch anime again.
>> ARTICLE
It's making me wonder for a while, what exactly is tragic with White Album 2? I watched it while it was airing and I'm sure there is nothing tragic there.
>> ARTICLE
Anohana for me. A lot more than it should have mostly because something very similar to what happened to them when they were kids happened in my life and for a long time I wished something like what happened to them in present time could happen for me too. Guess real life is a lot more strict on the rules.
>> ARTICLE
**BlackRock Shooter**.  Not gonna lie, I cried a lot during that, and to this day I still don't know why it made me so sad.  Also the usual, TTGL, Clannad,

The Pain arc of Naruto. One of the finest points of the entire Naruto series in my opinion, really packing the emotions and delivering on hundreds of episodes of build up. 
>> ARTICLE
I personally thought Attack on Titan was pretty sick. I mean it was not shocking in a way i way crying, but i got so emotionally involved into the story it was a fucking rollercoaster. Titans kill shit **(sad)** humans win **(happy)** Titans kill shit again **(sad again)** humans survived **(happy again)** Titans kill a lot of people **(sad again)** and so on and so on. 
>> ARTICLE
PMMM:Rebellion. I was not expecting it to throw my brain into so many directions.  I can remember the night I finished it, I was up so late trying to wrap my mind around the whole thing.

Steins;gate got me pretty good at some of the scenes.

I took 3 weeks after finishing the series to watch the movie thinking I would be prepared for it.

Nope.

Clannad: After Story and the VN of Grisaia no Kajitsu, damn those were amazing!

Clannad, why would anyone create such a tragedy? 
>> ARTICLE
I asked my friend for romance recommendations and he said White Album 2, however what I didnt know is he never watched it. So I start it and it's good enough until halfway through when it starts getting messy and I seriously have to force myself to watch the rest. Then the ending comes and I just didnt want to do anything anymore. I yelled at my friend for recommending me such a depressing show and he told me it was based off of a graphic novel, so I look that up. Literally every single ending is just as depressing if not more except for the true true true ending, like everything is good with everyone, you never lied to anyone, basically the 100% completion ending. Even that though was basically just enough to move on from it. I honestly dont know if i would recommend it to anyone. It was a different kind of sadness. One I couldnt even enjoy. I just felt empty inside. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched White Album 2 in one sitting last week and i can totaly relate. Ive cried on AnoHana and Clannad AS, shed a tear on Angel Beats, but nothing can compare to the nothingness left in my heart after that show. The emptiness after it was unbearbale and im still thinking about it everyday. 
>> ARTICLE
So I just finished watching Angel Beats! and... fuck me that was some ride.

I started watching it like month ago but I knew last 4 or so episodes will be sad so I waited till I was in a mood to watch it. Over all I'm really soft inside and there is lots of series that made me at least shed a tear but this one just rekt me :(

[AB! spoiler](/s "Even tho the very last minute of the show made me smile I just bursted into tears when Kanade said that she has Otonashi's heart, fucking completely lost it at this point. And not to go too far off topic I will just mention how annoyed I was because of the plot hole regarding why she was first in purgatory if he died first -.-")


>> ARTICLE
Nothing yet. Fiction doesn't really effect me on an emotional level.
>> ARTICLE
The Future Diary. Now I get this anime has a lot of mixed opinions on it but the end just left me absolutely heartbroken. I marathoned the first half by myself then rewatched the first half and finished it with a friend. A couple of days later I marathoned the whole thing by myself and I bawled my eyes out. The ending messed me up a little bit, I was thinking about it for days. Now, it leaving me heartbroken and depressed for a few days could've been that I just got out of a 2 year relationship. I'll never know because I can't experience it for the first time again.

Edit: I have seen Redial.

Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day.

I wasn't particularly broken at all until the very last moment. When Menma's about to disappear & everyone tells her they love her and Jinta says "Thank you for granting mums wish, I love you Menma"

Honestly i started bawling like a bitch right then. My manliness defected for a second. I'm sorry Kamina.

I'm completely in the same boat. Even though White Album 2 fucking destroys you and fucks your feels up it's still one of my favorite

. Do you know of anything else like it? I haven't watched Clannad yet, but have heard it's good.

I don't know many love triangle stories except for maybe [spoilers](/s "Clannad, specifically, Kyou and Ryou"), and definitely nothing on the scale of White Album 2 when it comes to tragic endings.

NOTE: The album does contain minor and major spoilers, however they are separated by the title of the background before they start to appear. If you see mention of a spoiler in the title, and you haven't seen Clannad, just close it there. 

Clannad: After Story is my favorite anime of all time. That also applies to the background art. It's improved quite a bit over the first season, both in fidelity and color depth, not to mention the settings vary more greatly in After Story. As a result of my deep love for Clannad: After Story, this is my largest album by far. 288 images to be exact. The only reason I have this posted so late in the day is because I was fighting with imgur for damn near an hour to get it uploaded properly and in order, and in the end its still a bit out of order, but its not a big deal. 

I highly suggest you listen to some music while you look through these. Give the song [A New Life Reborn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7j_LCeOeXU) a listen while you look through. It'll be sure to bring a tear to your eye if you've seen the show. 

Everything here is native 1080p Blu Ray quality screenshots. 

This is part of a series of posts where I will take my favorite screenshots of KyoAni background art from every show from Air to Musaigen no Phantom World, chronologically. Tomorrow's post is K-ON! Look forward to it!
>> ARTICLE
i appreciate your work man, downloaded every one so far. keep it up!!
haha you were not lying when you said this was going to be the biggest one yet... 1.2gb
>> ARTICLE
These pictures are bringing back the feels...

The first season looked good, but After Story really brought the town and countryside to life with its amazing artwork. 

I'm dont think anything KyoAni has produced since has matched the scale and overall artistic quality of it.
>> ARTICLE
I think KyoAni has done better art since Clannad, Hibiki Euphonium had absolutely stunning art, however I agree that Clannad's art is still better in a different way. Clannad builds a really believable world, and the art perfectly reflects the story and the characters. Maybe it's because the story is so powerful that I can't help but attach that to the art that I see, but After Story had my favorite art of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it is because it is a anime about relationships between the town and the people lived in it. These place is where the stories of Tomoya and his friend happened and also a part of their stories(the sakura road that Tomoyo what to keep, the forest that Nagisa love and later become the hospital with many stories happen here) and as the story develop , the town keep changing as if it react to the characters.
 
   And the town itself is a character in the series and it - quoted Nagisa's word "beloved by the people lived in it and it want those people being loved and happy too", every beautiful scence (like the light glow miracle scence and the heavy rain and snow when Tomoya lost people who important to him)here in the show us just that and add meaning to every scence more than just background art we saw in many anime
>> ARTICLE
damn, i forgot how amazing the scenery is, love the sakura trees in the album
>> ARTICLE
"Oh man some background art this'll probably have a few good pieces"

>load 278 more images

"..on second thought maybe I'll go through them later"

From the first few they look amazing, I'm saving this for when I can go on my computer and look, because I'm sure I'll crash my phone if I open it now.
>> ARTICLE
It's After Story, it's worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely a good choice. I really did try to narrow down the album, I just love After Story so much it became difficult at a certain point to take any out. Rest assured knowing that this is essentially every background image that appears in the show, minus a few boring ones. 
>> ARTICLE
That's dedication I do not have. Thank you for the massive album!
>> ARTICLE
I spend most of the time reading the subs and watching the characters that I always forgot that the Background Art of some anime are so cool

Thank you my good sir!

A lot of great background.

Thanks for your hard working.

Another *gold mine* for someone who collects characterless background-art, I had only seen a handful of Clannad ones before. Thank you so much!  
  
Also I should really get around to watching After Story so I'm allowed to see the other half.

God you should. You really should.

Simply beautiful.

Loved these two arcs, especially Yukine's which might be my favorite of them all. They were short, sweet, but still pretty damn brutal. For those watching for the first time, the main storyline gets going again here, as I know some people didn't enjoy all these arcs.

Not much to say really. Yukine trying to stop the fight between the gangs really solidified her as my favorite side character (besides maybe Tomoyo). I was not prepared for that and the following cemetery scene.

It didn't even feel like an ending to me, just the end of that episode. Then nothing more. I has a sad.

This. While it didn't leave a "sad" type void, having actually a pretty good ending, it felt SO RIDICULOUSLY STRONGLY like there should have been more.

I just wanted them to get together for realz so damn much :(

I really wish there was more. The art style when explaining the mysteries are pretty awesome, for example, the mystery about Chitanda's uncle. Also the last scene with the sakura trees.

Shinsekai Yori.  No show has left me with so much to think about and I'm honestly still not sure how I feel about the conclusion.  There are just so many moral dilemmas and the world building was so in depth.  The song of shadows still haunts me and it just fit so perfectly with the atmosphere of the show.   
>> ARTICLE
>The song of shadows

I fucking love that song, not one that I would listen to just going about my everyday but every time I hear it it just reminds me of the show and as you said, all of the moral issues associated with it.

I know I'm late, but to me a void isnt so much about having something emotional or depressing happen, but its more about me just being sad that its over mostly because I get attached to the characters and just get sad that I'm done.  For me the shows that I've felt the shittiest after finishing would be: 
  
* ToraDora!
  
* Sakurasou no Pet no Kanojo
  
* Nagi no Asukara

I only finished watching Sakurasou no Pet no Kanojo last night and I'm seriously considering watching it again, even though I just finished it, so I don't feel empty inside anymore.

Cowboy Bebop for me too. It's beautiful, not just the ending, the whole universe, every single character. To me it's perfect.

A large part of that is nostalgia, but I've found nothing that can fill it's shoes. 

Such a perfect ending too, when I first saw it I spent ages arguing with myself as to what happened, which is great. A direct sequel would definitely be detrimental to the franchise.

Actually, depending on [Cowboy Bebop ending](/s "the exact location of his wounds, Spike might not have died. At that time, he was surrounded by gangsters that were probably loyal to him. If he didn't have any cut arteries, he would probably live if they rushed him to a hospital. Furthermore, the director, Shinichiro Watanabe, said that not even he knows if Spike died.") That said, given the worldbuilding, there are probably lots of interesting people who could be the stars of their own shows.

to each his own dude, and Guilty Crown is mine
>> ARTICLE
Is Guilty Crown a bad anime? I was actually planning on watching that next...
>> ARTICLE
It's the same as many anime, people are comparing the hype before it aired and its huge potential to what is actually came out as. It's a decent anime in its own right but never lived up to people expectations.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say its bad. It just could have been so much better. That being said its a beautiful show and the music is amazing and you should probably watch it anyways
>> ARTICLE
It's an amazing production, with beautiful visuals and effects, complete with a beautiful soundtrack from both Supercell and the king of OST, Hiroyuki Sawano.

But the plot is a little cliche. And in later stages, you'd go like "wait when did that happen". And the ending is alright, but not exactly what you'd expect. All in all, just admire the beauty of the anime, but if you're watching as a critic, you wouldn't like it.
>> ARTICLE
Guilty Crown's soundtrack redeems the anime and relinquishes its sins.

I'm conflicted between really wanting to hear the soundtrack and zero interest in actually watching the show.

There's a really simple solution to that, (listen to the soundtrack )

Same here! It was really fun to watch. pretty to look at and nice to listen to.

There are way more truly awful shows that noone says anything about; but then again it makes people feel "sophisticated and that they have a high standard " when they loudly and repeatedly point out the flaws of popular shows.

Prep the stockade, I love the show...

It's a great show, it's just one that you need to pay close attention to otherwise you won't know what the hell is going on 

I can NOT stress this enough: YOU HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS GOING ON TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS SERIES! 

Have I gotten that point across?

Things are explained very well, they just don't constantly reiterate everything (motives of protagonist, how things work) ad nasium like in another beloved show, Death Note. 

Yes, I said it, Guilty Crown is better than Death Note 

Bring it on

Oh, I need to add that on top of it, Guilty Crown is also absolutely beautiful, the Audio/Visuals are the best that I have seen in any show or movie (anime/animated or live action) 

One of the best, most powerful scenes I have ever seen in any medium"

TTGL for me.

I think Legend of the Galactic Heroes would have done the same if it wasn't for the Gaidens and the movies. Even though they don't cover what happens after the main OVA series, seeing what came before helps you deal with the emotional roller coaster that the end of LotGH was. But the Gaidens are incredibly depressing in their own way.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that things like Steins;Gate, FMA:B, and Bebop were the ones that would hit me the hardest, but after I discovered TTGL, there is a huge hole in my heart.

A drill-shaped hole.

Koroko Connect, I loved the characters in it so much and I wish it had a second season.
>> ARTICLE
This right here is my favorite show. And the worst part is the next LNs in the series sound *so good* and I want to see them adapted *so bad* but we probably never will because of a stupid prank. 

Ugh. My kingdom for Kokoro Connect season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Every anime I have ever seen. I get hit in the feels so hard and easily.
>> ARTICLE
Yup... I don't even know why I keep watching, each new series is a mini-heartbreak.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano! definitely. I just can't imagine another helping to fill the void this one left. The train setting is awesome, especially combined with non-linear chronology, and an impressive cast of characters. This amazing show combined with the memory of watching it with all my friends at college is a show that will definitely always leave me with a void. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll recommend watching Durarara. It's made by the same author and has a very similar storytelling method (the puzzle piece type plot.)
>> ARTICLE
So for real? BECK, every time I watch it, leaves a massive void in my heart. It's just so real and relateable and such an accurate portrayal of what it's like be both a teenage and musician (separately as well as together). And I have yet to find a series before or since that really catches my like BECK did. Even when something similar comes along, I feel like BECK is a bit more... I don't know, earnest? I can't really describe it. There isn't really anything quite like it. But regardless, massive, gaping hole that will probably never be filled.  
>> ARTICLE
After watching **Madoka Magica: Rebellion** yesterday for the first time, I gotta say that left a pretty big void.

Not to say I thought the movie was insubstantial or anything. Hell, I thought the movie was pretty brilliantly pulled off and thinking about it during my run today, it's really rather incredibly well crafted for how much they advanced the story for one movie and in what I thought was a great direction.

But anybody that has seen it might empathize in that it just can't end here. It just *can't*. Well, I mean it can, since it's not really any more a cliff-hanger than the end of the 12 episode series was. It's definitely not a Berserk or anything.

But it'd be a dick move. I *have* to know what the girls do from here, I just need more of it. And seeing how much of a money cow PMMM is, I wouldn't be too surprised to hear an announcement about a continuation sometime in the future.

For series I've seen in the past, Clannad was definitely one that made me sit and reflect for quite a while. I still haven't come across a romance/drama that has hit that level of emotion for me yet either. And I'll also add Katanagatari to that list, one of the best odyssey stories I've sat through in a long time. I know it'll never happen, but I really wonder how the two of them press on after all of what happened and how their adventure will differ from the one we just witnessed.
>> ARTICLE
It better fucking get a sequel movie. The ending is just so rage-inducing, there has to be more.

I wasn't really enraged by it, more just surprised. I didn't think she would go so far but her dedication is seemingly beyond compare.

Toradora left a gaping hole in my heart after I finished watching it. I have grown so attached to the all of the individual characters that when it was time to end, I just couldn't imagine another show without the characters.

MANAMI A SHIT

>> ARTICLE
I think she was the only one with a sane reaction to the siblings wanting to fuck each other. 
>> ARTICLE
It's fine to be normal but don't try to force that on others!
>> ARTICLE
While this is a good way to think of things I think applying it to incest is sort of going a bit overboard. While I love me some incest in anime/manga realistically you won't find almost anyone irl who doesn't think it is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
While her logic is sane, her motives and motivation were horrible. Essentially all she cared about was her own ulterior motives, and really all she used to try and convince the siblings was reasoning based in extrinsic motivation; essentially saying things like "society doesn't approve."

In the end, if she can't convince them that their decision is bad for THEM then her argument is ineffective; she's essentially trying to tell people not to live for themselves but for others.

Plus at the end of the day she messed up both siblings bad when they were young simply based in her own insecurity and jealousy.

Manami is horrible. I just finished OreImo last night and I can't get over how much I hate her >_<
>> ARTICLE
I hated the ending more then a lot of the anime I have watched. Emphasis on HATE!
>> ARTICLE
Which part of the ending? I loved the wincest, and then hated where they left it hanging.
>> ARTICLE
The wincest I didn't mind but I was cheering for Ayase or Kuroneko to win. (Mostly Kuroneko) The biggest problem I had with it is that it ended with Kysuke not with any girl and the one he did finally choose he could only be with for a day. I would have been satisfied with the wincest had they ended it with them being an official couple rather than them only being a couple for a day and sorta, kinda, not sure, being married. 
>> ARTICLE
The problem is that this type of ending was A) it was completely unexpected. They spent all this time building up the "wincest" and sinking everyone's ships just to say "Haha just kidding!" It removes all significance from the rejection scenes and just makes Kyousuke and Kirino seem COMPLETELY childish, egotistic, and hurtful individuals. It's like they hurt so many of their friends all for nothing. Also B) by leaving Kyousuke #foreveralone, the writers are not rewarding their fan base/viewers. When you focus so much of a show on romance you HAVE GOT to finish your story. They didn't, which is what makes this ending so frustrating besides the fact that it made no sense in context of the rest of the story.
>> ARTICLE
The director of the anime said he wanted to go all incest ending, but wasn't allowed by the people that owned the original story. As someone who watched Oreimo only a couple of days ago, that ending is still bugging the hell out of me. 

Also, just gotta say I would love if we got to see a different route where [](/s "Kirino confessed to Kysuke, like she said she was planning on")!

Anohana most definitely. I cried like a baby at the end, and I'm in an anime slump, I can't bring myself to watch another anime. I need closure. Yes the ending was good and inevitable, but those letters at the end destroyed my heart, especially the letter Jinta.
>> ARTICLE
the movie just got released not too long ago. thanks for reminding me so i can watch it. BTW i strongly recommend that you watch clannad + clannad after story, it is 56 episodes long and has a bit of a slow pace because of character building, but by the gods... it is 10 times more emotional than anohana.
>> ARTICLE
That's a very strong statement. Anohana has been affecting my anime experience for a while now, and u expect me to believe that clannad is ten times more emotional. I'm calling bullshit on that. Anohanna was the first show to make me actually cry.
>> ARTICLE
Sir... with all due respect, you must embark your self into clannad, one does not simply come out with a soul out of that show. the first season is good but after story will shred your humanity. it is not necessary to watch the first season, but it helps a lot with the build up for after story. so do me the biggest favor and watch it, you will not regret it.

Gurren Laggan left a massive hole in me, even though the story had a pretty conclusive ending, it still left me with so many "what if"s and "if only"s. I don't think I have ever rewatched an episode as many times as episode 26, [Gurren laggan major spoiler](/s "Seeing yoko's perfect universe, where her truest desire was to be back to where her and Kamina had their first kiss, even 7 years later. Truly heartbreaking if you think about what Yoko went through in Gurren laggan with Kaminas and Kittans death.")

Yoko was one of the most developed characters in the show IMO. Definitely my favorite.

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann has left me wanting something just as amazing and well written for a decent while now. Yet to find it. Also, most won't agree with me here, but Accel World left a MASSIVE hole in me. I freaked out for a solid 2-3 weeks and almost entered a depression because I couldn't get my fix on it.

Guilty crown

Clannad

Samurai X Reflections

Oh god, after watching 100 episodes of tv-13 shenanagins. Kenshin always overcoming the enemy, finding ways to be a complete badass well remaining true to himself. Then you watch Trust and Betrayal and see exactly how strong he is and all the progress he made in his life.

THEN REFLECTIONS HAPPENS

I wont tell you what happens in reflections but lets say i will never forget the fact that i had to pace my deck in winter for 2 hours to calm down from what i watched.
>> ARTICLE
For me it'd have to be Angel Beats that's made me feel the worst after watching it. Madoka made me feel pretty shit, but I actually felt better about it after watching Rebellion. Kokoro Connect also had me thinking about things I'd have rather not, but neither of these hit me the way Angel Beats did.

I steadfastly refuse to watch Clannad.

Noragami.

Mostly because the ending is really cliffhangery and I hope for a second season (it's pretty early though), but in the mean time I look back at it, how much I enjoyed it and how underwhelming the ending was.

If it doesn't get a sequel I will be the most heartbroken guy out there :P
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Noragami yesterday, I loved it and completely agree with you.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Clannad: After Story for me too.

Steins;Gate is another one that I finished very recently so I guess it's technically "to this day", but I can't get my mind off of it. Maybe it's because I watched all 24 episodes in one sitting, but there's something about it - especially the two main characters - that I just really, really enjoyed. I've yet to watch the movie though, and will do so as soon as I reach a critical point of urgency.

Other than the MAL top fives though, I would say that there is a void remaining from Bakemonogatari and to a lesser extent Monogatari Series: Second Season. Waiting on Kizumonogatari/Hananamonogatari isn't too bad though since they're bound to come out eventually/soon, so I'll get my Monogatari fill soon, but there's something to Bakemonogatari that I can't quite pinpoint that I just love and haven't gotten again quite yet. Maybe it was just the uniqueness of it the first time I watched it, and that "hole" will never be filled. I don't know.
>> ARTICLE
Actually watching the S;G movie should fill that void. It wrapped it up quite nicely for me. It did everything it should have done.

What gave me the void from the original S;G is that Kurisu never knew all that Okabe did for her. His sheer determination is what makes me love him as a character. He deserved better than his fate.
>> ARTICLE
Before watching the movie, make sure you watch the OVA (episode 25) which takes place between episode 24 and the movie.
>> ARTICLE
I did watch the OVA, and it was pretty much what I expected. If anything though, it just made the hole even bigger by the end, but it was a nice addition to the overall narrative albeit a mostly filler one.

But thanks for stopping by to say so anyway, had I not known there were an OVA I would have definitely wanted to.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised to see Steins;Gate this far down; I found S;G totally ruined me, I just couldn't get enough of the characters and am still depressed to this day at the lack of more S;G...


Obligatory Tuttaroo~!
>> ARTICLE
Tuttaroo!~

Each of the characters - no matter how major, or how minor - all tied the narrative together so nicely that I found it hard to leave them behind by the time the series had ended. One of the best romantic pairings I've seen to date, an amazing story and stellar character development, and a pace that I was totally on board with the whole time (I'm in the minority believing that it doesn't start off "terribly slow", just slower than the latter half of the series). Gonna be a tough gap to fill.
>> ARTICLE
I actually liked the slow first half too. It's way too easy for a series to rush into things and leave stuff like developing meaningful and non-forced relationships between characters as well as worldbuilding to the wayside because it's hard to do in a story that drops you right in the middle of the action. Having a good 12 episodes of relatively status quo all the while building up to the rollercoaster second half in the background made it way more thrilling and emotionally investing overall. Also, all the science and pseudoscience behind the tinkering of an unsuspecting looking Phone Microwave (name subject to change) combined with the hilarious ravings and smart banter of a self proclaimed Mad Scientist made that slow part entertaining in its own ways. 

I highly recommend watching the OVA (episode 25, "Egoistic Poriomania") if you want some light hearted closure. It really adds nothing of importance to the story that you hadn't already figured out, but all you really want is (more) confirmed shipping of the star couple, and it really delivers. In a way, the movie too is something that really doesn't add anything to the original story (there's no cliffhanger ending for it to resolve or anything), but gives fans of the series one more treat. Still worth the watch, it's like a dessert ontop of an already satisfying meal. You've had your fill, but like hell you're going to pass up on that offer.

Also, if you ever want to jump right back into Steins;Gate again, consider trying the visual novel. Of course it will be a lot longer and it won't be animated, but the art and music is really great, there are multiple different endings you've never seen in the anime, and you get to peer right inside Okabe's mind and send all the D-mails and time leaps yourself on his cellphone.

Edit: looks like you've already watched the OVA

I hate that the manga was announced as coming back and one chapter was released and then it just stopped again and I still haven't been able to find out why.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely Clannad Afterstory, and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, both were such great animes for their own reasons, that it is just really difficult (not impossible) for anything else to live up too. But my gosh man, I mean I'm really surprised about you liking Guilty Crown so much. And especially the thing about Code Geass not filling your void, seeing as Guilty Crown is basically a carbon copy of Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
I did see the similarities, but I think my refusing to see it as a carbon copy of Code Geass is what made me not lose my love of it. Yes there are the mech similarities (though they are barely in GC compared to CG and to be honest im not a big fan of mecha so thats ok to me). Yes I see the similarities between Inori-C.C. and Lelouch-Shu, but I also see them as their own very different characters. 
The "power of the king" is a copy only in title. The powers are two very different things and have very different meanings. The last big similarity is the whole "Japan controlled by an outside force" though the two forces are there for two very different reasons and they both lead their respective stories in two very different directions. 
I agree that GC definitely took some ideas from CG for inspiration, but in my opinion they become two completely different things in the end. Also GC's animation and music are many cuts above CG's (CG's noodle men got on my nerves for all 50 episodes).
>> ARTICLE
Well I mostly base my accusation that GC is a carbon copy of CG on a post someone made in a forum I used to belong to around the time guilty crown was airing. It was so well done showing how well the plot fit into one another. I really wish I could find it for you if only for a joke, but unfortunately that forum doesn't exist any longer so I can't.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really see a lot of similarites between Lelouch and Shu

Its been a while since I've seen Code geass but this is how i remember Lelouch

Hes manipulative, calculating, and always had a plan for his goals. He knew what he was doing, he had a central idea of what he wanted done.

Shu on the other hand was more prone towards being manipulated, he was impulsive, and easily controlled by his emotions. He didn't know what he wanted to do with himself, he kind of let things go with the flow, and only when he realized he couldn't return to a normal life do we see his shift as a character. 

Even then there still stands some of what defined shu. 

I felt more emotionally invested in GC than CG simply because I think GC had better usage of its music and the deaths were more focused upon. 

I personally wasnt a big fan of CG, but I think it was an anime that GC had taken some ideas from. But to say its a carbon copy is a bit extreme. 
>> ARTICLE
If you ever listen to the Code Geass OSTs you'd notice most of the pieces are *amazing*.

I also don't agree that Guilty Crown had better deaths, the only interesting one was the turning point in the series, the rest didn't matter as much or were hastily decided. In Code Geass all the characters who died represented parts of Leouch himself, and as such were more powerful IMO.

The only times I've felt this sort of thing is when an anime disappoints me by wasting potential, or suddenly radically changing direction.  Even those with supremely depressing or unpleasant outcomes that are well done end up being satisfying for me as long as it is well done.  The only one that comes to mind right now in such a fashion is Vandread.  An incredibly disappointing second half.

That ending killed me. I wish they just would've never addressed the graduation thing. Like done what other high school shows do where they end the series a few days before they graduate, i.e seitokai no ichizon.

Hm... Nothing really springs to mind now. Back in the day though, Great Teacher Onizuka's ending left me wanting a continuation, and a [GTO finale spoilers](/s "resolution for the Onizuka Fuyutsuki romance.") I think that's because lately I have been watching anime one after another, not leaving myself time to feel any sense of loss upon completion.

Anohana, crest/banner of the stars, Stein's gate. Clannad (obviously), Sakurasou. Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora(gets so little recognition) Finally, that feel when you're watching the end of the last episode of dragon ball GT, knowing the ride is over. 


VN version of little busters. The VN is measured in the number of days it incapacitates you. It hits everyone, no exceptions. The anime cannot even compare. 


Also a vn but no anime for it (yet) Rewrite. Over a year after finishing it there is still this giant gaping hole left in me bigger than anything else. 

also- I've been watching One piece for over 10 years. I don't know when it's going to end, but when it does... there is going to be a rift in my heart for the rest of my life.

I've been looking for a show that gives me the same feeling as Death Note forever.  The kind of show with a plot that is as incredibly well-written with the same type twists and unexpected developments.  What Death Note did a great job at is making both Light and L both feel like evenly matched SUPER intelligent people, and because of the way the plot was written, I came to believe it as well.  Unlike with other shows such as Code Geass, Lelouch's genius isn't really ever tested.  He never goes up against anyone of his caliber, so you just have to accept the fact he's smarter than everyone else without much to measure him against.

L and Light both served as measuring sticks against eachother.  We knew L was intelligent as fuck because he outwitted Light on some occasions, and we knew Light was devious and intelligent as fuck because he outwitted L on some occasions.  Code Geass just handed you Lelouch and was like "See how good he is at chess?  That's how you know he's smart."  Brittania was completely inept in comparison to L.  I just want another good psychological battle that Death Note gave me.

Cross Game was fantastic in the sense that I never had anything as heartwarming. Clannad was more dramatic, AnoHana was sadder and Welcome to the NHK felt like it hit close to home despite never having been a NEET. But I haven't had an anime be as easy-to-watch as Cross Game has proven to be.

The weird but succesful combination of slice of life, drama, sports and romance doesn't make it the best anime out there, but it certainly makes for a fantastic one.

Are we talking like a void as in "wow that was good, nothing will ever be so good" or like something that you end up comparing everything else to, or are we talking about a soul crushing dead void? Cos if it's the latter, then it's got to be Eva for me. I watched the episodes mostly erratically and out of order on toonami. Then when I got a bit older I watched them in order on dvd. One night I watched both End of Evangelion and death and rebirth in one sitting (think I was stuck awake on ice, can't remember) and I just remember sitting there thinking "now what?" I didn't feel any catharsis or closure. I just felt upset and sorta like I'm not even sure how to explain it. It sort of reminded me of when I watched the film The Wall, the pink floyd movie, when I was real young. Something about it all really disturbed me. Eva is something I watched once and never will again I don't think. I honestly don't want to go through it again. I've started trying to watch the new movies, I got passed 1.1 or something, have the rest ready but I'm just dreading it in a way.

Clannad: After Story.

I believe it is the reason I have become such an avid fan of high-school romcoms (although AS can be far from it) is because the void of Clannad shall never be filled. Ironically enough, I only watched Clannad to get over ToraDora!

I liked guilty crown a lot too, but after it I just kind of went on with my life.

The one that left a void inside me was Sora no Woto. I don't know exactly what it is, but watching that Show I felt so... alive I guess. And now that feeling is gone. 
>> ARTICLE
Anohana - One of very few anime to actually get me heavily emotionally invested. It didn't disappoint but the feels.

TTGL - Need I say more?

Edit: I forgot to add Gungrave/Gundam Seed. 

Seed was THE first anime that I watched outside of basic television and adult swim. A friend introduced me to it and it was and still is the only anime i marathoned straight through, start to finish. 

Gungrave, well, because it was also among the very first anime that I actively searched and watched. In my opinion, it was just so awesome and made me invest emotionally. The sci-fi second half could have been done better but overall it was great.

There's a lot of mentions here that I agree with, but a few I'm missing:

- **Kimagure Orange Road**: Technically it wrapped everything up, and the ending was very final indeed (when ova etc are included). However, that just made it a bit worse for me as now the silly everyday stories were over and there was no chance of it returning. Perhaps I'm viewing it with rose-tinted (orange-tinted?) glasses as it was one of the first anime I've watched, but toradora etc just don't come close.

- **NANA**: just unsatisfying ending in general, still hoping the story will be resumed at some point

Others: **Haibane Renmei**, **Honey & Clover**, **Kareshi Kanojo no Jij**

Kaiba. Spoilers ahead.


This show fundamentally changed what I know about humans and what the are. The premise is brilliant, and I truly felt how terrible it is to manipulate memories and how they construct the essence of a person.

I still don't like how it ended, which felt pretty meh considering how it introduced the value of personality and being. The universe it built, having the ability to discard and acquire memories, and how cruel or pleasing it can feel was quite a shock.
I took it very seriously, and some episodes left me crying. It looks childish, but it conceived such a grand idea to me that I took to heart.

I may have misunderstood the idea behind the thread (shows you got attached to and feel the need to watch more of), but I do also share this sentiment about Kaiba. It could've explored this idea in more depth which I can't get enough of, but what's done is done.

Ah man I'm with you on the guilty crown part. I had first started watching it here and there but only to episode 5, and I just picked it up again from the beginning 2-3 days ago. I had to marathon after finishing the first half, I just fucking had to know and watch it, and I think because of that, the ending hit me hard.

To go along with guilty crown though I have yet to find anything to replace the void in my heart that can fulfill the amount of hype I need week to week since kill la kill finished. The hype, my god the hype...

And on a more sentimental note, I believe the only two anime that have made me cry and left a void were Anohana, and Angel beats. (Haven't watched clannad, usually don't want the sentimental ones, but Anohana was a reference from a friend who told me about guilty crown aswell, and I had read the angel beats manga and then watched the anime.)

So hopefully this long ass post gives you some insight into what my void is, pun totally intended.

exactly this was my first thought when i clicked on OP link. I mostly watch OP and ED only once. first mirrai nikky OP was one of exception that i watched it almost every time.

This. I thought he was speaking in reverse or something. The second one is one of my favorite OPs, while the first one is just cliche and bland sounding.

I fucking love that song.

The main guitar riff is so crispy and the singer's voice is gruff and awesome.
>> ARTICLE
The guitar riff was the best part! 
>> ARTICLE
That song has been an inside jokes between my friends and I for a long time. We all felt the same way. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit hard-pressed to think of examples in the direction that you specify; I can think of several that have a far superior second OP or second ED.

**OP:**

Sword Art Online - crossing field to INNOCENCE. cf is a far better song, even though INNOCENCE grew on me eventually.

Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu - Bouken Desho Desho? to Super Driver. Amazing song to a terrible one, straight. Perhaps it may be a case of nostalgia, but I feel as if the quality of Hirano Aya's music steadily declined after the original Haruhi songs.

**ED:**

Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo - DAYS OF DASH to Prime number ~Kimi to Deaeru Hi~. No comparison. DOD was absolutely fantastic, but Pn has both a slightly worse song, and a horribly animated video sequence.

K-On!(!) - Don't say "lazy" to Listen!!. Was not a fan of the change in style, and I didn't think it complemented Hikasa Youko's voice well. Thankfully, they made up for this change with the fantastic ED that followed, NO, Thank You!.

Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu - Hare Hare Yukai to Tomare!. The dance was gone. In its place was a song that just sounded much more generic, IMO.

Gosick - Resuscitated Hope to unity. Same artist and similar musical style, but the first song had a fair bit of drive to it. The second just seemed very flat and melancholy.
>> ARTICLE
Aww come on....

Sakurasou's songs are all good... 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but we're comparing DAYS OF DASH to Prime number here, and there really isn't any contest. Prime number is a good song, but DOD is an amazing one.

The main thing hurting Sakurasou ED2's case is the fact that the video is unwatchable. I really don't like how they didn't sync the head-bobbing with the music.
>> ARTICLE
Prime number's chorus, man!


>> ARTICLE
>I really don't like how they didn't sync the head-bobbing with the music.

It is synced, but in a strange way. Their heads ~~reach the apex of their arcs~~ start a new arc on every second beat.
>> ARTICLE
I actually liked INNOCENCE to Crossing Field. It feels more dramatic and in motion than Crossing Field. The second ED (Overfly) is also better than the first (Yume Sekai), even though Yume Sekai had its nice moment in the montage that was shown after Kazuto woke up in the hospital.

Of course, the real SAO song gem is [Itsuka no Tegami](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYGJHQJP0Q8), I think it's a B-track from the Crossing Fields single since I don't ever recall it being played in the anime, but it's friggin beautiful!
>> ARTICLE
> The second ED (Overfly) is also better than the first (Yume Sekai), even though Yume Sekai had its nice moment in the montage that was shown after Kazuto woke up in the hospital.

Definitely agree. Overfly is one of my favourite ED songs, ever.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, I like Listen!! as a song a lot better than Don't say "lazy". As an opening, Don't say "lazy" works better but I think overall Listen!! is a lot stronger in terms of vocals and is more fun to listen to.
>> ARTICLE
I have to say that I really liked Super Drive for Haruhi. [It's so damn lively](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBS0AGgGTnQ). I think it fits Haruhi pretty well.
>> ARTICLE
Super Driver was the shit.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I liked the 2nd OP more.
For the EDs, the 1st ED seemed more energetic and upbeat. Especially with the dance.

The second one's starting to grow on me a little, but it's definitely still no contest for the original one.

Yeah, it's starting to grow on me as well. The first opening is *so* good, though, so my immediate reaction to the second opening was "what the fuck is this?"

Shin Sekai Yori. 

First ED [Wareta Ringo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMoAF6PgOCg) was just... amazing. 

Then it got changed to [Yuki Ni Saku Hana] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARECdYpXz5Y) which is 'okay', I just don't think it lives up to the first.

I like how the actors sang the song :p

This. They went with the first for 16 episodes, then they changed it with only 9 remaining. Pretty unusual time to do it.

I think it sort of makes sense since [spoilers? not novel afaik](/s "it mostly revolves around Maria's kid (thats what I think it is at least).")

Hm, it might be disturbing for most people, but I liked it as much as the first OP.

I feel like the only person in the world who liked the second OP. It was crazy and unique.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was okay, and had a good beat going, but then the song self-destructs at the end. If you watch the music video for it, the band literally flails about for a second and then just leaves the set.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, [the whole show kind of drove off a cliff in the second half anyways](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
I got close to finishing it and threw in the towel. I'll go back one of these days, I just had really high hopes.

when i think of death note i consider the first half and the very ending, and block out the second part

But the second opening occurs well before the 2nd "Part" of Deathnote. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't really remember because I started skipping the opening when that abomination began.
>> ARTICLE
well, the band responsible for the Death Note OP/ED **was** maximum the hormone, a "nu metal/hardcore punk band"

it actually grew on me though, [it's pretty funny at times](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9RhBlnHWCY)

Sakurasou no pet na kanojo [first OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9HK-pjzK0Y) and [first ED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_978314&feature=iv&src_vid=u9HK-pjzK0Y&v=nLwQjKTgNB8) versus [second OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZsIi8wgK6Y) and [second ED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_939468&feature=iv&src_vid=tZsIi8wgK6Y&v=V4_XA9VwQ_4).

Shiki too, [first OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw5u3QVdHjA) versus [second OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDZaCDwC4pM).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the first OP and ED for Sakurasou are really great, and I still listen to them almost every day. However, the new ones are slowly growing on me.
>> ARTICLE
Spice and wolf op and ed downgraded from its first season. 
>> ARTICLE
Even I agree with this.
>> ARTICLE
Psycho-Pass.

It's funny that both EDs are done by EGOIST, but the first one suits the show much better than the second.

The first: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5ZFHfdL7o
The second: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7akZjxgNAk

I also am in the camp of people who believe the first OP to be superior to the second, because screaming post-hardcore > Engrishy generic alternative any day of the week.
>> ARTICLE
I was double pissed, because not only did they change the song, they got the band that did the first Zetsuen no Tempest OP (which I cannot stand)
>> ARTICLE
Agree with the first OP being the best. Got me to go and obtain Ling Tosite Sigure's full discography; they have some excellent songs.

I kind of like the second ED better than the first, though.
>> ARTICLE
Well I totally agree with the EDs. 
But Im unsure about the OPs. I liked the first one really much, but when it changed I was disappointed first, but then they threw in [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTgRUvKUOs) awesome video. And because of that, I cant decide which is actually the better one.
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree on the EDs. I would play the first ED on repeat on Youtube and had it stuck in my head for a while, but I feel nothing for the second ED to the point where I can't even remember the melody.

As for the OP, I'm on the fence. Initially, I didn't really like either of them, but over time they've grown on me. The first OP really suits the tone of the series, in that it's dark, a little chaotic, and on top of that, the sound is a little more unique and memorable. The second OP sounds more generic but I feel it's also more catchy and easier to listen to, plus I really dig the animation even if the colours are a bit too bright for the tone of the series.
>> ARTICLE
I just wanted you to know, I agree.
>> ARTICLE
I like both OPs a whole lot, although I'm with you in saying the first one was superior.
>> ARTICLE
First ED is from Shogo's perspective and 2nd one is from Akane's perspective.  The 2nd ED fit so well with the last episode 
>> ARTICLE
Contextually, it does make sense.  It's just not my favourite ED song, per se.
>> ARTICLE
The second OP was amazingly done in that last episode. They even edited out the "Are you still here" line, which made it even more amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
I love the first OP for not being just a generic j-pop song and actually incorporating screaming.
But its a lie if I said the second one hasn't grown on me. Probably because the different color schemes were interesting.
>> ARTICLE
The second OP has really grown on me. I think I like it more than the first one now.
>> ARTICLE
I really like Nothing Carved in Stone, their English is pretty good, actually.

And to be honest, after they added the OP's animation, it totally clicked for me. I reckon they're as strong as each other, both suited for the cour they're in. :)
>> ARTICLE
Their clarity is nice, but their lyrics don't wholly make sense when put together.  This is easier to spot in Blast of Tempest's first OP, but it's still really distracting for me.

The animation for the second opening still saves it, but I still think it's a bit too vibrant for the second part.  But that could just be me.
>> ARTICLE
Durarara first Op was sick, but then it changed and it could never live up to the first one. 


>> ARTICLE
Got to agree with you there, I loved Uragiri no Yuuyake the first time I heard it. Though I think I skipped the OP a few times near the end of the series, Complication couldn't live up to it. Good band, just not their best song by far. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked the second op just as much as the first. Although the second half of the show just wasn't as good as the first half.
>> ARTICLE
Sakurasou.

First ED [Days Of Dash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5PBrd1jH04). I loved this ED tune. 

New ED [Prime number ~Kimi to Deaeru Hi~](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kl3OA6iRZ8) it's a good song, but no where near as good as Days of Dash.

EDIT: Just remembered. The OP from the first season of Working!! was a lot better than the second season. 

First OP [Someone Else](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhWrbdX-MPc).

Second OP [Coolish Walk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui2TiMcRRfw).
>> ARTICLE
i actually prefer ED 2. oh well, different tastes
>> ARTICLE
First OP way better. Second ED has grown on me a lot though.
>> ARTICLE
I like the whole song of Days of Dash more than Prime Number, but the lead-in seems to work so well with the more dramatic build from episodes like 13 and 14.  That little riff that plays sounds amazing with headphones, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
[The 1st opening sequence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJjT50rRfok) of Working!! was also better than the second.

I really liked Robotics;Notes first opening. It was upbeat and fun! The second one? Not that bad, but duh...

 [GJ-bu ED 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxdFKHJ2Xug) 

Though a slightly different situation from what you describe, it was by far my favorite of the current season... but only used for 2 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're going to get a different answer from everyone for GJ-bu. I like the [Kirara ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqWCnB-P9P4) the best.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK

First ED:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqCSQOIsh7o

Second ED:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB3YZ_VsZWE



>> ARTICLE
I guess it's different for me. As fitting as it was, I never liked the psychotic bits of NHK's music. Outside of the context of the show, they're just really strange and jarring, so they're never something I'd want to listen to to remember to show by. So when Modokashii Sekai no Ue de started playing, it made me really glad.
>> ARTICLE
I actually love the 2nd ED
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really dislike it but the first ending was so fantastic, that the change just confused me, different strokes I guess
>> ARTICLE
This but with the openings since they removed the friggin trumpet.... no one messes with the trumpet ;___; 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely! I was really missing the trumpet during the second half
>> ARTICLE
I was really disappointed when the ED changed for Shin Sekai Yori. The animation and the music of the first one were so brilliant and so interesting, and the second feels like Just Another Anime End Credits.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka (though it's more of a case of going from "Oh that's a cute OP" to "HOLY SHIT"):

Openings are the lighthearted tone as it goes, and then Episode 3 gives us the ending theme for the first time, setting the true theme of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka was my first and last "Magical Girl" Anime...
>> ARTICLE
Every fucking series where there's 2 or more.

^^^usualy.
>> ARTICLE
Death Note, at least that's just my opinion. The OP.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely loved Darker than BLACK's [first OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rulBhrngxI8). Unfortunately, its [second OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoDvuGulu68) really does nothing for me and is entirely forgettable.
>> ARTICLE
As far as I'm concerned, the [season 2 OP](http://vimeo.com/38274212) outdoes them both by far.
>> ARTICLE
That might be, but whole season 1 is doing the same with whole season 2.
>> ARTICLE
If you watched the opening not knowing it was Darker than Black you would think you were about to watch Initial D or Wangan Midnight for the first 20 seconds or so.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, a drifting Porsche is totally relevant.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if it counts but the first 20 seconds of the [Guilty Crown OP](http://youtu.be/DjUtmbZt8zc?t=7s) sound incredible and get you all hyped. Then it changes pace to some relaxing crap. 

Kind of makes up for it at the end though.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you so much for showing me this. This song is amazing and I will now watch Guilty Crown.
>> ARTICLE
Euuuuuuhh....Guilty Crown is a great example of how throwing tons of money into production values (music and visuals) does NOT equal an enjoyable watch, plotwise.

I mean, go nuts, watch it, but it's nowhere NEAR as cool as the OP and stuff make it sound.
>> ARTICLE
Guilty Crown was alright but I feel Code Geass was a similar and much better series.
>> ARTICLE
* [Zetsuen no Tempest](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest)

 The first cour's OP was amazing and really set the serious tone of the show.  The new one is incredibly generic and really makes it feel like a bland shounen.  Even the production quality of the first OP is better.

[First OP](http://vimeo.com/56218815)

[New OP](http://vimeo.com/57721958)
>> ARTICLE
I came to here to say both Gosick and Shin Sekai Yori and they had both already been said. I got nothing.
>> ARTICLE
Second season of Working!! has a crap opening compared to the first. The first opening was amazing! They should have kept it the same.

The last opening of Gundam SEED Destiny was also bad, in my opinion. I only ever watched it once and that was more than enough.

Valkyria Chronicle's first opening was much better than its second opening, as well.

And recently, there's Hyoubu Kyousuke. The first opening's version of the song was much better than the second. I have no clue why they changed it. They also keep changing the color scheme, too.
>> ARTICLE
What?! Working!!' had a hella catchy OP. I mean, it's not quite as good as the first OP, but it's still one of my very favorites.
>> ARTICLE
i don't get too worked up when they change an OP or ED even though i might like them allot, because it gives the chance to another OP or ED that i might like, and i can always go back and watch the old ones or skip the new ones all i like
>> ARTICLE
Saki had one of the [catchiest EDs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fySGYYiVCeg) ever, and did the whole "ED music starts at the end of the episode and flows into the actual ED" thing *amazingly*.  The other EDs (main series and Achiga) were alright and I do love beach WAI WAI's animation, but none of them could really live up to the first in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Space Brothers! Unfortunately, I can't find any good links on youtube, but as far as I am in the series (30 episodes) I've seen them switch themes three times, and the second OP and ED were definitely the best of the group.
>> ARTICLE
OP1 > OP3 > OP2

ED2 > ED1 > ED3

I definitely agree that the second ED is the best, but I don't know how anyone can dislike Feel so Moon.
>> ARTICLE
It's not that I dislike it, I just like Eureka better. And that dance!
>> ARTICLE
Naruto: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjN6sqFt-ds

In part one and two, there has never been an OP as good as this one.
>> ARTICLE
I completely, thoroughly and utterly disagree. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rol6ugmgQ2w

Even more poignant and powerful when you read the lyrics, it's amazing how well they fit with everything going on in the series at that time, and kinda depressing.

the first vandread OP is much better than the one in the second season in my opinion.

I agree, i perrfer Borderlands to the Opening for Perfect Order

I love both those songs, but I actually think the Perfect Order song was better.
>> ARTICLE
One of the better animes for just being plain cool but with a forgettable story was sacred seven. It pulled a wierd one with it's op and ed. instead of switching songs they switched positions. so the OP became the ED and vice versa half way through the season..../facepalm
>> ARTICLE
No really related, but the Opening of School Days grew up to more and more unbearable after each episode. It began with "The OP was *ok*" to "This OP is fuckin ominous and sinister".
>> ARTICLE
Sayonara zetsubou sensei was a bit inconsistent with which opening it would play each time but for a while it was rocking[ this (nsfw ish)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8ODecbuhA). Whenever [rumba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAEhEYrHe6s) played I was a little dissapointed.

When it comes to Zesubou-Sensei, you are either a Burei fan or a Rumba fan.

For me it was with Hyouka. I prefer [Opening 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uft865-5EXo) to [Opening 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xtuubiTq_M) every time.

Gunslinger Girl
 "[The Light Before We Land](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIfZZ1cQZss)"

I think the original OP is a ton more fitting ( and beautiful ) , then what they replaced it with in the second series.  Second one sounds like your typical OP.

[Tatta Hitotsu no Omoi] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88lCO6ICfbA)


>> ARTICLE
I have to disagree, the first 15 seconds or so are... hauntingly beautiful in Teatrino, and those alone IMO make it better overall.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't watched the second season yet, but I agree with you mostly (though I feel the original was merely fairly good).
>> ARTICLE
Opposite here. Toradora first op was meh, but the second op was freaking awesome.
>> ARTICLE
* **Toradora** - One of the few that can make you cry with pure romance and no death or sickness or etc.

* **Steins;Gate**

* **Ef - a tale of memories / melodies** 

* **Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (AnoHana)** - many swear this was as good as Clannad. I think it's mostly the [beautiful ED that's making people cry [spoilers].](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=5J1b-yAay1g#t=139s)

* **Angel Beats**

* **Eve no Jikan**

* **5 Centimeters per second**

* **Grave of the Fireflies** - haven't watched this myself, but I guess I should recommend it given its hype.
>> ARTICLE
I second everything except Toradora - pardon, but it's terrible.

Every single person on reddit, most reviews, even 4chan said it was awesome so I tried watching it.

Main girl is a generic tsundere Shana expo, complete with Kugumiya voice, from first ep it's obvious how it's going to end, nothing of much meaning happens in most episodes, the romance is fake and, honestly, not too romantic.

On another note: Watch the movie version of Eve no Jikan - it's all the OVA eps, just in higher res and with some additional scenes.
>> ARTICLE
I apologize on behalf of the communities if you really felt it was bad. =(

Generally I think a balance of familiarity and originality is what makes anime enjoyable. Thus whether you enjoy a show or not is dependent on your own life experience. 

For me, Toradora was a highly well-executed generic romantic comedy. Despite unoriginal characters, setting and ending, it explores our more memorable high school experiences and emotions with uncanny accuracy (and dramatic enhancement). And I thought some of the slight twists on the traditional romantic comedy characters were quite charming; Ryuugi's constantly drunk mom, his 'house-cleaner' tendencies, Ami's perceptiveness and disguised kindness, the homeroom teacher's frustrations, Ryuugi's berserker rage, etc. 

Having [*beautiful music*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAC8Qi2zD-E&feature=related) doesn't hurt either. Hence Toradora is among my *highly* recommended list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Watched all of Angel Beats today, the ending was sad but didn't made me cry.  It is a good anime to watch through.
>> ARTICLE
the moment the song went on and he screamed, my vision went blurry :(

How did this turn into a recommendation thread?
>> ARTICLE
Why the hell did you pick that as your username?
>> ARTICLE
Yes yes yes, good list. Intriguing, since I've teared up to many an anime, but I didn't realize that I was largely insensitive to romantic tears until I looked at your list. I've watched those series and they didn't hit me, and I had no idea.

Well, with the exception of 5cm/sec. Oh my god, that movie.

Let me tag along with your post by recommending Aria up here.
>> ARTICLE
By the end of angel beats I was choking up toradora did that to me too
>> ARTICLE
Eve no Jikan was the best anime I've ever seen in my entire life, but how does one cry over it?

Also the drama in AnoHana seemed pretty forced. It's like they were deliberately trying to make me cry.


>> ARTICLE
upvote for a tale of memories. clannad did not get me but that one did

Dude, dude, put a spoiler tag on that ED video!

Edit: Thank you :3

its mentioned elsewhere in the thread but please don't leave out graveyard of fireflies from the top post. 

also i second angel beats. steins;gate i really liked but i think clannad and angel beats desensitized me, i'm watching anohana now.

I couldn't watch the last two episodes of Toradora.  I highly recommend.
>> ARTICLE
2nd to last episode is the best episode! You're missing out! The last episode is really heartwarming too.
>> ARTICLE
Why not??

They were incredible!
>> ARTICLE
Those kind of endings (I'm presuming) make me feel like crap for the rest of the night after watching them.  I wasn't in the mood to feel like that at the time.
I really should watch the ending though.
>> ARTICLE
Quite the opposite, imo it's the kind of ending that will leave you up half the night musing about the mysteries of the world, love and the human heart... Definitely worth the watch.
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of the ending, did anyone wondered what the hell happened [when Taiga just left somewhere for a year for no good reason](/spoiler). I  mean it didn't ruin the ending, but it felt sort of forced drama.
>> ARTICLE
> Hasn't seen Grave of the Fireflies

You, sir, are missing out on arguably the greatest film that anime has ever graced us with.
>> ARTICLE
I promise, after Redline =3
>> ARTICLE
Watched it today. The storyline wasn't very impressive.  The main character was pretty cool. But it was like watching art. Just amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the backstory enriches the experience. The movie was adapted from a Japanese novel about a guy whose sister died from malnutrition during WWII. He ends up blaming himself and writing that novel as an apology to the sister. 

So how does that tie in with the movie? The coolest thing I found out is that the audience is suppose to hate the main character. This is actually a complaint that many people will make of the movie. When you realize that the author wanted it to be this way because the movie was suppose to be a apology, it explains a lot of his style. It becomes a tragedy where you know the outcome, and cry out at the mistakes the main character makes (which the movie in itself accomplishes in the first minute by explicitly telling you that he died alone as a kid).

Now your complaint: the story wasn't impressive. When I found out that the movie was an apology, the story almost took a backseat role. The emotions and consequences of the mini-arcs took precedence over the overall story (with what would seem like a poor resolution). 

I watched this a week ago, and have been since opening up to anime, which is why this stuff is so fresh in my head.

I've have yet to watch something that makes me cry, it can make me depressed but never shed tears. I bet Grave of the Fireflies would do it though.

If Grave of the Fireflies doesn't make someone tear up, then I only have three theories: They weren't really watching it, they lack emotional response, or they're one of those back-hill "They deserved it" idiots like we saw posting during the tsunami. It's a tough story to watch.

I've been putting off watching it for yoinks now. I guess I'll probably just feel really depressed after watching it and then cry myself to sleep every night for the next fortnight _

This is exactly why Ive owned Voices of a Distant Star for six years and not watched it yet. >.>

Your guess would most likely prove accurate.  Trust me, I've seen it.  I've seen plenty of sad, touching movies with no effect.  My friend bet me that I'd cry watching GotF.  By the end, no manly tears were shed.  No no, I was emitting little girl tears.  Big brother just ripped off favorite teddybear's head little girl tears.  I sobbed so hard it hurt.

You bastard...
>> ARTICLE
**Angel  Beats** ad infinitum, man.  It was animated/produced by the same companies as Clannad, and the ending is just amazing.
>> ARTICLE
C - The Money of Soul and Possibility Control  dont know why but the two last episodes always make me cry
>> ARTICLE
grave of the fireflies and barefoot gen
>> ARTICLE
I think your question has been answered spectacularly by the other redditors.

I also would like to add my own: Love Hina was the first anime I cried happy tears of joy for at its ending, and Clannad and Toradora were the sad tears of unhappiness.
>> ARTICLE
The first one that came to my mind was Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, Welcome to the NHK made me cry once or twice.
>> ARTICLE
Planetes. the final episode (among others).

Also, if this is the kind of thing you enjoy and would like to experience again, rather than watching anime, you should try some visual novels. There are many quality titles which provide great/deep/emotional stories. Hell, even Clannad's based on a visual novel (which I'd recommend playing for alternative routes, not only Nagisa's).
>> ARTICLE
Watching boku no pico made me cry, but for a different reason. In the off-chance you don't know what it is, don't look it up, if you do be forewarned it is very nsfw.
>> ARTICLE
If you want to have a short-story romance, heartwarming and tearjerking, in a single episode, complete with some comedic elements and stunning graphics, look at **Bakemonogatari** *episode #12*.

I re-watched it yesterday, it is completely self-contained and you can enjoy it without the rest of the series.

This is also something to show to your liberal arts major friends when they ask why you watch anime. Definitely better than trying to convince them with the fight scenes of **Pretty Cure**, for example.

PS: Try to get hold of the 1080p version of **Bakemonogatari** and watch on a big-ass TV screen, if possible. It's worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I Just acquired a very large screen tv. The Bakemonogarari BR rip was the 1st thing I watched.

Uh... this may generate some debate but:

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. Not a bad series, if a little poorly done. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I cried watching Air TV. 

Another one: Saber Marionette J made me wail for hours on the end. The squirrel episode was also a tearjerker.

>> ARTICLE
Tsumiki no ie

Made me tear up in less than 15 minutes... truly amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad as well but also Kanon 2006, pretty much anything by key honestly.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't cried in a while, but when [that little girl- Nina, I think- dies](/spoiler) in Fullmetal Alchemist I teared up a lil' bit.

Sorry I know, mainstream and all that. Still.
>> ARTICLE
I respect your decision but i think otherwise.

[Hughes was the real tear jerker. As soon as Elicia says "Daddy said he has lots of work to do and if they bury him he can't do it when he wakes up." oh god how the tears flow.](/spoiler)

Kanon(2006), Ano Hana, and (I'll admit it) K-ON when they sang the goodbye song for Azusa.

The ending was so sad.

I want to contribute here a bit. In Russia we have a very popular (probably the most popular) source/database of anime [world-art.ru](http://www.world-art.ru/animation/) which also has its top. And it looks like this:

4. Code Geass R2
5. FMA: B

Beck is a wonderful show. Glad the Russians like it as much as I do. GTO, as well.

Russian anime fans confirmed to be only anime fans without shit taste.

I like Hikaru no Go, Skip Beat and Bakuman being there
>> ARTICLE
Holy Shit Beck! I approve!!

Wow! Beck : MCS is there, that's my jam

This is the best list.

Edit: My reasoning is the presence of  both GTO and Usagi Drop, and only one Gintama.

Oh, Toradora! is here. Also Death Note takes the first place, quite interesting.
>> ARTICLE
yea everybody fucking knows death note here. Its been on the tv quite often.
>> ARTICLE

\>no Monster

I'm dissapointed.


>> ARTICLE
Probably because there is no dub of it. And it's pretty old too.
>> ARTICLE
Monster is on rank 50. 
>> ARTICLE
For some reason, I really like the idea of Russians liking GTO. Onizuka kind of has that "Fuck it, were Russian" sort of vibe. Never thought about it before, but yeah, it works.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting enough. Also this list has considerable amount of shoujo/josei anime (Usagi Drop, Nodame Cantabile, Nana, Skip Beat!) that you don't see in other lists.
>> ARTICLE
It makes me happy to know that Russians apparently really like shoujo/josei. I'm not sure why, probably just the disconnect between how the internet commonly depicts Russia and something like Usagi Drop.
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, mandatory 'people /= government' comment. By the way, Usagi Drop is my favorite slice of life anime.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mean that in a bad way. I meant it in the silly "Look at this truck in Russia driving down a highway at 90 MPH / 144 KM/H on three wheels" kind of way.
>> ARTICLE
Was about to point that out. Maybe drinking vodka while watching shoujos makes it a lot better
>> ARTICLE
I need to try it.

>> ARTICLE
Importing the spreadsheet to Google docs would have worked, but this is way more pleasing to the eye.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see GTO is at least on *one* of the lists.
>> ARTICLE
That's...that's a lot of R2 love.
>> ARTICLE
HummingBird is the only website where the original series has a higher rating than R2.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually a really weird statistic. Normally, the second season is higher rated simply because the people who dislike the series never get to it. They drop it in the first season and then never touch the second season, resulting in slight inflation. On Hummingbird, the general userbase agrees that R2 was a large enough drop in quality from R1 that they even get past this inflation. My own opinion on R2 vs R1 aside, this is a pretty interesting statistic.
>> ARTICLE
I always thought of it as R2 having such a beloved ending, that it left a strong, good taste in everyone's mouth after the loveable trainwreck the actual season was. 
>> ARTICLE
The only part I didn't get was why he kept sneaking back into the school once he was long gone... It would have been easier with an entire freaking army to capture the people he wanted to protect from the school and keep them in the military base, but being smarter than everyone else and overcomplicating things is what leluch (sp) did best.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think R1 is much better than R2 simply because R2 is such an insane trainwreck. The ending saved it from having a lower rating than what I currently think of it.
>> ARTICLE
I actually felt completely different. I felt R1 was the trainwreck and R1's ending/R2 saved the series for me.  I even rewatched the series and came to the same conclusion. Of course, R2 (and R1) had lots of flaws themselves, but I just cant imagine Code Geass as a whole being better without R2. Maybe a better way of putting is I think R2 had higher highs and lower lows than R1. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel as if R1 was better because it was more strategic. R2 basically devolved into whoever had the best mech would naturally win. Oh shit that mech is so powerful, oh man now my mech has new stuff on it so I'm better, OH SHIT I HAVE A MECH THAT CAN DESTROY EVERYTHING WHILE STANDING STILL AND SHOOTING LASERS. Though the ending was very very good for R2 which is why people rate it highly imo. 
>> ARTICLE
I get that, but I dont see why people treat them almost as two different shows because of it.

R1 still had lots of strong mechs that single handedly turned around the battlefield and made strategy redundant. Examples include the the always incredible Lancerlot, Gurren and Lelouch's fucking Gawain)

R2 still had a lots of strategy and wit underneath the fights, including the escape from the chinese, the destruction of the tower, strategic positioning of the armies in the huge final battle. All of this that people *seemingly* forget just because there is a Lancelot and Gurren flying around.

You see. People act as if there are two extremes, R1 was prefect strategy and R2 was a stupid mecha-power circlejerk. But if you look closely, you can see each season actually has a lot of both. This is why I think the distinction between R1 being 'so much better' than R2 is just foolish. Strong Mechs and Strategy *is* Code Geass. If you just want strong mechs, go watch Gundam, if you just want strategy, go watch Legend of the Galactic Heros. But you cant just like Code Geass and then ignore half of what it is. Accept all of it or none of it.
>> ARTICLE
I just wish someone could explain to me why R2 was a trainwreck. What am I missing?
>> ARTICLE
I think it mostly boils down to the fact that the plot goes a bit haywire and introduces a ton of meaningless characters. I personally consider Code Geass one of my favorite animes but I honestly can't recall anything that happens between s2e1 - s2e22. It's very unmemorable save for the ending.
>> ARTICLE
[CG R2](/s "Sure you can! For example, one of the best scenes in the entire show is when Rolo kills Shirley. The bunney suit Kallen is all over the place too. What about how freaking cool Suzaku as a knight is!?")
>> ARTICLE
I'd spoiler tag that^ anyways. But yeah, that Shirley scene messed me up. Can't forget that

MAL should seriously combine all the Gintama series except for the movies .

By the time the new Gintama comes this year  im 100% sure half of the list of the top 10 would be Gintama for a long long time  and I love gintama but still !
>> ARTICLE
I agree that MAL should reconsider when they combine entries. However doing so presents some clear challenges.

Firstly there's the question of what you do on the database side when combining series. Delete everyone's old ratings or try to average them out? At some level you'll lose data because inactive users won't come back and change their ratings, and inevitably you lose the information of which half is higher rated (even though selection bias arguably makes that question meaningless).

Secondly you open the more difficult can of worms of what criteria should be used to determine when series should be combined? When the second season follows directly from the first in style? When they air within enough time of each-other? When the MAL user base votes that they should be combined? What about splitting up Death Note into two halves on the same basis or going all the way and rating individual episodes?

I think it's clear that MAL will need a better system for dealing with the fact that most anime now take up several MAL entries, in this age where increasingly a show will get an 11 episode first season, 9 or so 2 minute specials, an OVA episode, a split cour second season, recap movies and finally a sequel movie.

The solution that I do think will eventually be implemented will actually be some sort of franchise system, but even that presents the problem of how do you divide up something like all the Ghost in the Shell anime.
>> ARTICLE
Easy

Allow a rating for the entire franchise but also allow people to rate individual seasons/segments/episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Consider the following example with made up ratings that do not reflect my actual opinion:

GITS SAC 2 episode 11 is rated 8.48

GITS SAC 2 is rated 8.55

GITS SAC (S1 + S2 + Solid State Society + Solid State Society 3D + Laughing Man +  Individual Eleven + ...) is rated 8.62

GITS ( GITS + Innocence + 2.0 + ARISE + SAC + GITS 2015 + ...) is rated 8.34.

Personally I think that's a lot of data to process at once. Furthermore it would put a strain on the servers to store that much more data as well as all the calculations needed to pool all those numbers together. I don't think it's impossible or even a bad idea per se, but I do think it would be difficult to implement in such a way that it's nice to use (both in terms of performance and UI).

I always find it endearingly peculiar that the ANN top 25 has three Maria-sama ga Miteru seasons. By the way, it's a very pleasant series.

[All the seasons are on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4U0FQ15BX8D1-lCVHli3WNK7KhVOuBtH)
>> ARTICLE
Now that you've pointed that out I've been consumed by curiosity? Was it a belligerent effort by /u/ or some such organization in a bygone era? Do ANN's users happen to be similar to the other sites for the most part, but have an unusually high ratio of Class S fans? Is this an oddity of the algorithm ANN uses to get their averages?
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop and Baccano! both in the top 25 on hummingbird, with Bebop nearly in the top 5. Sounds like my kind of site 
>> ARTICLE
It's fairly out of date at this point, but if we're looking at lists, [there's also this AniMetaCritic List](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/) from The Cart Driver, which compiled the MAL ratings of a bunch of anime critics/bloggers. It's unsurprisingly slanted towards the kinds of shows beloved by people who like to write a lot of words about their media, but with a number of surprising picks as well.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow nothing in the top 11 surprises me, except maybe Aria. Didn't know it was that well acclaimed critically.
>> ARTICLE
It's likely just reflective of the general self-selection that goes into sequel ratings - if you're watching the third Aria series, you're probably a person who's inclined to like Aria.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game and Nodame in the top 25, could AniDB actually have good taste?!

Summer Wars should be bolded, looks like.

Don't say such things around here, people will run you out of town for liking good anime.

I enjoyed Cross Game, would you recommend the other 2? 
>> ARTICLE
If you have any classical training or just enjoy classical music, you will love Nodame. If you liked anything like Honey & Clover, you'll still like it even without that.

Summer Wars is basically my favorite movie ever.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. Think I'll also check out Summer Wars because I looked it up a while back and the bunny looks pretty cool from what I can tell. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved Nodame. It's a music slice of life, so if you're not into that, don't watch it, but the characters were nice, the music was fantastic, and I enjoyed it thoroughly to watch all 3 seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. I'm meh with slice of life. Last one I saw was Nichijou which was hilarious but I'll give it a shot if I'm in a slice of life mood!
>> ARTICLE
The AniDB results look majorly affected by the fact so many of their entries have so few ratings. Nodame has 6490 AniDB ratings compared to MAL 51210 ratings and Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season has 437 AniDB ratings compared to 8695 MAL ratings. Furthermore they seem to inconsistently amalgamate anime with all 3 Madoka Movies occupying a single entry and Mushishi Zoku Shou having 2 entries.

That's not to say that it's not possible that AniDB has good taste per se, but rather that their top rated anime list is messed up.
>> ARTICLE
Ima get rekt by downvotes for this, but **seriously,** why is FMA: B so universally loved? I watched the whole series 3 times just trying to understand what I was evidentially missing; as far as I could see it was just averagely good?
>> ARTICLE
One of the few shows that goes on for that long and actually has a cohesive, structured beginning, middle and end. Just a well told story is all.
>> ARTICLE
It's the anime equivalent of a western fantasy novel. Great world building, unique story, diverse cast, great character development, some twists and turns, satisfying ending, mix of action, drama, and humour, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I think to get at the top of lists like this, it's less important for it to be loved, than for no one to hate it. It also benefits from fame and popularity - it gets voted 10/10 by a lot of a newcomer anime watchers who have nothing else to compare it to.

It also exemplifies really well its genre. People who won't like FMA:B don't watch it in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Because its a perfect 10. The way they blend the dramatic moments with the soundtracks (and sometimes ED), the action is top notch, the VA's are *phenomenal* and its funny. 

Whats not to like? 
>> ARTICLE
different people like different things
>> ARTICLE
Can different people think different things?
>> ARTICLE
you don't say
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't mean that those different people liking different things don't have their own personal reasons for liking those different things.  lilelf29 probably was asking for examples of those personal reasons specifically referring to why people like FMA:B.

Basically, why do different people like different things?
>> ARTICLE
A big reason is because it's an easy to reccomend show, free of some of the dumb tropes that plague anime like random upskirts, MC's falling on vags, etc. I did like it a lot, but I definitely find some big problems with it, my main one being the ending. The main villain was probably one of the most boring villains in anime, and that ending was so shonen it was unreal. I actually thought that the original FMA was better, the villain was more interesting, and the beginning was much better (they skipped a lot in brotherhood)
>> ARTICLE
The biggest thing is that it's just a very solid show across almost all aspects. It is a great first anime and can appeal to everyone with a story that can be embraced by all, yet still holds quirks that make it uniquely it's own and uniquely an anime. It doesn't seem to excel at one particular thing, be it animation or sound or drama or comedy, but it still does all of those elements very well, and the combined overall goodness is it's biggest appeal. It's a jack of all trades in a way, and it just an overall balanced show. It also helps that the plot is one of the most well wrapped up storylines I can recall, and that "OHMYFUCKINGGOD" moment when everything comes together is really memorable.
>> ARTICLE
It has the largest draw and I think is consistently good in all aspects and all around very enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's universal. Anybody of about 12 or older could watch it and enjoy it. It's got good animation, well fleshed out characters, a great and original story, and plenty of philosophy. It's got funny, happy, sad, exciting, tense, scary, and thought provoking moments all wrapped up in one 60 episode series. It can be shown to anybody as a sort of "entrance to anime," yet a veteran watcher can enjoy it just as much. It has very few flaws (nearly none, actually) and does everything it tries to do extremely well. It covers all of it's bases; It ends the story in a satisfying way, it fleshes out it's characters thoughts, feelings, and actions and the reasons for each, it doesn't use bad CG and has an appealing art style, the pacing is good and doesn't leave much to be desired, it has a good english dub, and a million other things.

The show is just perfection incarnate. It's good because it doesn't fuck up. Steins;gate fans will admit that the show up until the latter half was slow and uninteresting. Gurren Lagann fans will say that Yoko was a bit overly sexualized, and that some bits at the end could have been omitted for sake of time. Cowboy Bebop fans (like me) will admit that the episodic nature bores some people, and the show is really only a 7 or 8 out of 10 until you've seen [spoilers](/s "the last episode"). But FMA:B is just ***good***. It's not that something about it is so keenly sharpened that it stands out. It's like a clean, sharp kitchen knife. It's not your sharpest, but it's flawless. It shines, no scratches, cuts everything equally without fail.

Maybe I'm exaggerating when I say it's perfect, but it's damn near it. I would go as far as to say it has no glaring flaws at all. But yeah. That is, at least, my take on why it's considered the best. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your detailed reply, you have convinced me to give FMA:B another try.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but as an FMA:B fan, I can easily admit the show leans too heavily on the action shonen tropes (The whole last few episodes in particular) and Ed and Al are very sidelined down the line. The first 13 episodes are also rushed through pretty hard, which makes some scenes lack a lot of emotional power. Not only that, the humour can easily come off as obnoxious due to its placement (IMO its better in the manga). FMA:B absolutely is great, and it does have a universal popularity factor that pushes it forward for the younger audience of anime, but to say it has no points of contempt is absolutely ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly your point about the rushed early story is why I recommend starting with FMA if you're at all interested in the fullest experience. I'd say as a whole the original FMA is much weaker, but after watching it first FMA:B's beginning was VERY short indeed. I didn't care too much because I wasn't really looking to re-watch all of that again, and I think that might have been something the creators considered.
>> ARTICLE
As I always say,  FMA: B assumes you've watched FMA, so it skims over the beginning
>> ARTICLE
> I watched the whole series 3 times to understand what I was evidentially missing...

There are shows that I adore that I haven't watched that many times.  Maybe you like FMA:B more than you think?


>> ARTICLE
I think Brotherhood is so widely enjoyed because it's the most western. Other factors help, of course. The source material was incredibly well-written, and the adaptation was extremely faithful. Few anime tell a single overarching story so well, connecting every dot and and plot point. I could talk about why I like Brotherhood for hours.

But if you ask why it's so universally loved, I think the lack of Japanese influence is a big factor. No difficult to pronounce names with difficult-to-translate symbolism, no unfamiliar references or settings, and very little reliance on puns or wordplay for humor. I struggle to think of anime with as little to do with Japan as FMA: Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
You could actually be on to something there as I would say AoT is similar in terms of being western and it didn't enjoy it.

The animation quality was flawelss in AoT, but just about everything else was pretty poor imo.
>> ARTICLE
How did it in Japan?
>> ARTICLE
Really average actually. I don't remember exact numbers but the Blurays sold under 10k, maybe closer to 5~7k, despite the manga's immense popularity. To put it into perspective FMA:B sold as well as Guilty Crown, slightly better than Dog Days S1 and less than Hyouka. 

FMA:B was quite a long series though so that may attribute to its low sales. 
>> ARTICLE
I've got another one:  Attack on Titan is also a strictly western setting.  Based on its popularity I'd say your diagnosis is correct.
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B is just the anime that appeals to the most people. There's lots of action which appeals to a younger audience, yet there's also science, strategy, and questions about humanity and religion which appeals to an older audience. There's some very sad moments and a lot of comedy. There's some romance but it doesn't spend too much time on it. While FMA:B is outclassed by other anime in pretty much every area, FMA:B is at worst considered averagely good and many people consider it the best anime because it has so many different aspects going for it.

Also great characters, soundtrack and animation.

I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time, as bold of a claim as that may sound. It's what happens when you mix in a perfect adaptation of the source material from an anime studio with absolutely phenomenal writing. And to have that consistency in both writing and animation for a full 150 episodes is what solidifies it as one of the best. 
>> ARTICLE
> I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time

And not everyone shares that opinion as evident by a couple of top 25's. I think that's fine, it would be rather boring if everyone likes the same things. As they say, variety is the spice of life.
>> ARTICLE
That's true, and I'm not necessarily saying that these rankings are literally wrong just because HxH is not on it, because there are a lot of anime deserving of a top 25 spot. Simply explaining to /u/Heizenberg what /u/bloodgods was trying to say.

Anime isn't 'dying' but I don't know why these charts would make for a convincing argument that it isn't.

What the airing year table tells us is that anime fans have only a very limited sense of the anime past.

>> ARTICLE
Might get some hate for this, but since it's in 4 of the 5 lists now's as good a place as any to say it: 

Wolf Children isn't as good as everyone says it is, and I don't really think it deserves a spot so high on so many lists. 

Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with plenty of touching scenes and is, without a doubt, visually beautiful. But I don't think it's the masterpiece so many people seem to say it is. I'd hardly call ti equal to most Ghibli movies and, other than having a slightly unusual premise, wasn't anything too special. Since I should probably back up these opinions, I'm going to get into spoilers. So If you haven't seen it: turn back now.

My biggest problem with this movie is the ending(s). I feel almost totally robbed of an emotional climax. Ame becomes the real focus of the story for the last quarter and he's honestly kind of unlikable. For his big emotional scene all we get is a

"No, don't leave" 

"I have to leave" 

"Okay" 

kind of interaction. Which I suppose could be impactfull if they did a little more with it, but as is it feels very anti-climactic. Yuki doesn't even get that. All she gets is one confession of her identity (in an admittedly cool 'shot' where the curtains blow in front of her as she transforms and whatnot) to one kid. I found myself asking what this reveal is supposed to mean for Yuki. Does it mean she's accepted her wolf side even though she wants to be human? If so why does she continue into a life where her wolf side is so hidden? Again, it felt like some big realization or emotional peak was closely missed almost altogether. 

I'm also not a fan of the length/pacing. This movie is just under two hours, but not a whole lot really happens in that time. Some segments feel like they get a huge space of time to be developed even after we already get what's happening (I'm looking at you extended "it's hard to have young kids" montage) and others feel pretty rushed. (particularly the ending) 

It's a good movie, with an excellent premise that looks very nice and has a few interesting time lapse, POV, and other scenes. But beyond that Wolf Children really didn't blow me away like it did so many other people.
>> ARTICLE
All I did after Wolf Children was to go hug my mother, she's raised my brother and I by herself almost single-handedly right after migrating to Australia. The film resonates a lot with me personally so it's one of my top films.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a good film but I can't see any way that it's one of the best 25 anime titles. 

But then again if I wanted a really solid stab at that kind of list I'd assemble a committee of people I trusted and have them fight it out and then write up an opinion with collective responsibility, rather than aggregating the ratings of thousands of randoms.

It's interesting in a kind of anthropological way that thousands of randoms loved Wolf Children to bits.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I accept your opinion, but I disagree.

Let me start by saying that I think that Ghibli is generally overrated. It's sort of funny, because endings are generally where Ghibli falls apart. Miyazaki wants to tie things up too neatly, so the climaxes of his films tends to come out of nowhere, and break the themes and characters of the films just to wrap things up happily. Spirited Away is most egregious for this - no, the film is *not* about the main character's ability to supernaturally sense whether the pigs are her parents what are you even doing Miyazaki!!!

In contrast, I think Hosoda's films have endings that flow naturally out of the themes and characters. Even if this means that they are open ended, or often very unhappy.

The main character of Wolf Children is the mother, Hana. The theme of the story is this core question - can she hold to her resolution that she would allow the wolf children to make their own choices in life, and love them unconditionally for that? Even when the choice is one that she does not want them to make, that takes them away from her? The tension in the story is between that resolution and her desire as a mother to do all that she could possibly can for the children. The story ends when she finalizes this resolution, when the children develop their own choices, when the story moves on from her story to the untold story of these children and how they live the rest of their lives.

The point of the ending is that the viewer occupies the same mental space as Hana. Adulthood comes all too suddenly and against your will. An emotional catharsis is denied. There is no one big realization, only the culmination of small choices that take place without you knowing it. You become only a small part of someone else's story, a story that is denied to you. This is an incredibly brave and personal choice on Hosoda's part, and one big reason I find the film really special. I can understand it not working for everyone though.

(As an aside: Yuki revealing her identity is about the changing of a secret. Her wolf side was previously a secret shared by the three members of the family. Now it's a secret shared with one she loves. Thus, the secret of her wolf side is recontextualised, it's not something that holds her back any more from the human interactions she desires, and so something she resents and fears. But instead it's a moment shared, that binds her *to* those she loves.)
>> ARTICLE
Also something interesting to note is that Hosoda has been clear in interviews that the film is a tribute to his own mother. Yuki and Ame represents himself - the path he felt his mother wanted him to take, and the path that he did take.

I thought the Gintama manga was fairly amusing, but I'm surprised that it rates so high on so many of these lists.
>> ARTICLE
While you don't hear masses of people talking about all the time it's a constant undercurrent. I can't speak about the other sites but on MAL, along with other long shows, it also benefits from the requirement that you need to have seen a fifth of a completed title for your rating to be valid, which means a lot of the people who try and drop it don't register.

I suppose I shall have to try it myself one day.

Ok, lets do this... Clannad explain it to me. White album 2 is one of my favorite shows, the relationships portrayed in that show feel very genuine and the struggles the characters have make for a incredible show. I know almost nothing about Clannad other than the character designs put me (way) off and from the few screen grabs I have seen it looks like the literal poster child for generic moe blob harem show.

Are the characters well written? Is the setting actually interesting? Is it more than just a love dodecahedron? I think I just need a push to get over my gripes with how the characters look, but as a outsider it seriously just looks like the most generic 90's Harem anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Its not for everyone, but there is a reason why it is considered a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is rather generic yeah, but its still pretty well writen and the chars are likeable.

Now thw senbd season, Clannad:Afterstory(the one that appears on the tops), it's a whole different beast, while the first 8 ep are rather crappy, when the afterstory kicks in, it just leaves anyone speechless.

It's a family tale, a tale of reconciliation, and the feel trip is otherwordly.

PS: sorry for typos
>> ARTICLE
I literally stopped like 7 or 8 episodes in and haven't touched it yet. It just bored me to death, so I moved on to something else. Maybe I'll give it another try.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't give it another try, I watched the entire two series because people kept saying it got better. 

*It gets better after the Fuko Arc*

*It gets better at AS*

*It gets better in the second half of AS*

*The last few episodes make the series*

Complete waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
I came into afterstory expecting too much (reading all the hype for it) after watching clannad. I was always waiting for that special moment to happen and i was waiting to be impressed for the entire series yet nothing spectacular or minblowing ever happened. Sure there were sad moments but didn't make up for the boring first 15 episodes. So clannad and AS as a whole was a huge disappointment for me.

Do you think it is worth a rewatch in some time to maybe get a different opinion of it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i have to agree with you, and i didnt even get that much hype, only from my one friend(who got me into seasonal anime) and he loves literally everything japanese. He would basically be a weaboo, except he actually has japanese blood. So obviously i didnt buy into that hype and my reaction was nowhere near as positive as his. I really dont feel like the good emotional shit of the last 2/3rds of AS can justify watching through the mediocrity(imo) of most of the first season and the first 8 episodes of the second. Im only like halfway done making my MAL, and i really have no idea how the fuck im going to score the series.
>> ARTICLE
well overhype can ruin a lot of stuff, so is normal.
It really depends, for me i know it's worth a rewatch since i liked AS a lot, but you need to be conected to the characters, or the feels wont hit home run xD.

I would recommend you to start a rewatch, and if you see yourself in some of the characters, continue watching, if you don't feel any special interaction, it's probably better to just jump to another anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you know little about Clannad, by all means go in and watch it. Hype can a real destroyer for some people, and I'm grateful I watched both seasons of Clannad with an open mind. The character designs did throw me off a bit, but it only took minutes to get over it. I'm by no means well-versed when it comes to these types of shows, but it really packed an emotional wallop with an intelligent story supported by a super strong cast of characters. Honestly, I can only think of a handful of shows that measure up in quality with Clannad. 

Speaking of White Album 2, I'm planning on watching that after I finish K-on! It's been hyped so much to me, but hopefully I can approach it without any major expectations. 
>> ARTICLE
The second half of the second season made people cry so the entire show is amazing, that's what Clannad is.
>> ARTICLE
Did someone say [90's Harlem animation?](http://reenied.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Super-Globetrotters.jpg)

I'm guessing you meant Harem? Clannad is a slice of life comedy, the MC's ok, the girls are ok. The *feels* are forever. It is no where near WA2 in character depth or scope, but if you liked any KyoAni's stuff (K-On, Air, Canaan, Haruhi) then it falls in a similar category.
>> ARTICLE
> Did someone say 90's Harlem animation?

Lol fixed
> The feels are forever

This is the part I have heard about, and the reason I want to watch the show, but can you really feel a emotional kick when all the characters are just "ok." Oh and if the characters in Clannad have half the amount of awesome interactions Kyon and haruhi do then I think Ill enjoy the show quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Kyon x Haruhi is much better imo. But you get a solid first season of interaction followed by a story going legit sad. It puts more effort than most shows. If you've seen AnoHana or Steins;Gate then you'll understand what I mean. 

KyoAni series: Haruhi > Hyouka > Clannad > K-On > the rest. To give you a rough idea of expectations.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is indeed kind of harem-y, with one male raking in chicks by helping them with their problems. It's enjoyable, pretty moe, and gives you intermediate feels. 

However, the second season is much more mature, and deals with the life of the male protagonist beyond high school, and focuses on his relationship with one girl for the most part. The second half of After Story is known as monstrous rollercoaster of emotions, and the feels level is through the roof, which is why it is considered so highly . I without a doubt recommend that you watch the series if you can put aside the art style and generic plot at first. 
>> ARTICLE
Wolf Children and Spirit Away? I feel like anime movies should be in it's own list like most lists when they say the best shows and best movies.

You can think Parasyte is a good anime and still undeserving of Top 25 status.
>> ARTICLE
True enough. Judging by the tone of his message, though, he's obviously not a fan.
>> ARTICLE
The ratings of anime that are still airing are infamously inaccurate. Raters haven't seen the whole show especially the ending (which invariably changes opinions), those people who don't rate shows they haven't completed haven't contributed their opinions and often the sites use different algorithms for determining average ratings while the show is still airing (in particular MAL only counts your rating if you have seen one fifth of the episodes that have been released). Even after long after an anime has finished airing their scores tend to gradually change over time for innumerable reasons.

I would offer the hypothesis that AnimePlanet's Crunchyroll integration is partially to blame for whey the score of Parasyte in particular is so inflated compared to other sites.

Of course that's not to say I think that it should be in a top 25 anime list (at least not so far). But what are you expecting an anime community not to have shit taste?

Depends on how you define Anime.

Anime is animation made in Japan

That's the definition- even this subreddit agrees on that as it's right in the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_everything_posted_here_must_be_anime_related)
>> ARTICLE
I think it is up to someone's interpretation. But to call one side wrong is well, wrong.
>> ARTICLE
That is *a* definition. Not *the* definition. It may be this sub's chosen definition, but it is not the only (nor widely - meaning outside the anime community) accepted one.

Merriam-Webster (somewhat of an authority on language, at least English) states this as it's definition: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime). You will notice that the emphasis is on style - one that originated in Japan - but makes no statement that it cannot be produced outside Japan.

Again, regardless of either of our opinions on the definition of anime, it's silly to say that that is the only definition.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hear any of that, but even if they did at this point, I wouldn't mind it too much. I don't see that as an anime either, but I judge the website for it's overlays, accessibility, ease of access, w/e.

That's an arbitrary reason for losing respect. It's not anime but it's close enough, who cares?

If I had never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime I would not believe that for a second

They are pretty far from being anime, mind I still like some of those cartoons very much on their own merits.

And there are many other reasons I dislike Hummingbird, the fact that they include non-anime is just one of them.
>> ARTICLE
Ah the old anime argument again. I take it you are in the camp that says anime = cartoons from Japan? If so, I present yet again: Le Maison Petit Cubes... (aka Tsumiki no Ie, aka Pieces of Love) an anime which you would probably say was not anime had you "never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime"...

This whole argument is ridiculous tbh, but please do go on and tell me why you think Avatar is not anime while Tsukimi no Ie is.

Couldn't stop crying after episode 17.

He said that to get to the extremely emotional parts you have to watch close to 40 episodes... Which I deem a bit too much to invest in.

There's no point in "investing" in the entire series just to get to the part that makes you cry.  That is not 100% of the content of Clannad.  Both the first season, and AS are full of content.  Whether is be character building, character introduction, humor, slapstick, romance, sadness, whatever.  It has a number of themese and much more than "be bored for 40 hours, cry for a few hours, done".
>> ARTICLE
Basically OP said he didn't feel very emotionally invested until the 2nd season, 17th episode in. Yeah, there may have been other good parts... but he didn't mention that. I'm not hating on Clannad, just remarking on what OP said.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't realise I was so emotionally inveated until that fateful scene in AS.
>> ARTICLE
I watched both and I have to admit, the only reason I like them as much as I do is because of the last 8 episodes.

Without them being what they are the whole show would pale in comparison to some others.

That said, all the episodes leading up to that point inform the audience of the characters and are at least pleasant light-viewing.
>> ARTICLE
Well I forgot to add, before watching Clannad (which also was the first visual novel adapted to anime I watched) I really wasnt into slice of life/romance animes, which I think didnt make me realize how rich Clannad was in other aspects. I had heard of it for a while and all I heard was "its so sad, you cry" so my expectations were through the roof and like any other expectation it can never be fullfilled and I guess that made me not find the first season as emotional as I should have. 

Yeah my comment was a bit shallow, I didnt even expect it would get points, my bad.
>> ARTICLE
Shit, even the VN made me cry at the end.
>> ARTICLE
There was one joke in Clannad that had me laughing far harder than I'd care to admit, but the series' strong point is its drama.  I watched it when I was 17 and I'm a guy, and I enjoyed it.  Granted, I enjoy romance series, which, from your wording, you're not a fan of.

Clannad and Afterstory, while having romance drive the plot, are more focused on drama than on the actual romance.
>> ARTICLE
As much as I grew to hate Fuko, the series wouldn't be the same without her part.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad definitely had more ~~Sunohara~~ humor, After Story focuses more on the romance. That's not to say Clannad doesn't develop any romance, or After Story contains no humor, but that's the way they tend.
>> ARTICLE
Was it the juice box?
>> ARTICLE
Oh ya, Clannad didn't even have the running down the street eating bread scenes.
>> ARTICLE
It had them at least every other episode...
>> ARTICLE
What?  Yeah it did.
>> ARTICLE
It spanned both?
Ah. Yep. It seems it did. Pity it all felt like a build up to the bread tray.
>> ARTICLE
That did have me laughing, but it's not the scene I'm thinking of.  It's another scene with Fuko, though, "It comes off sometimes."

Watching the scene again, it's not all that funny to me, but I guess since I wasn't expecting it the first time around, it really came across as hilarious to me.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my gosh yes, I had to pause. I was laughing so hard at this joke.
>> ARTICLE
As much as I didn't like the Fuko arc, the interactions between her and the MC are amazing.

Clannad is great, but After Story is far better.

Be warned though, you'll need a few boxes of tissues.

OP, don't listen to this man's warning. Do *not* bring boxes of tissues. You'll be crying a lot, so bring empty jugs instead. Collect all the tears, and drink them later when watching something really scary. Label the jugs "Man Up Juice"

Clannad is a mix of hilarity, drama, more hilarity and very light romance.

After Story is where is gets really sucker-punch-to-the-feels type sad. It's pretty surreal.

Aaaaaaand upvote.

I was NOT expecting the emotional damage this series caused. It brings you up, sets you down a little bit a few times along the way, then fucking drops you. And then you take an elevator half way back up and the floor drops from under you!
>> ARTICLE
Just watch it dude.. and get of of /r/anime till you finish AS, don't spoil yourself

also, do yourself a favor, before you start to watch After Story buy some of the shit that 3DPD woman gets when they are in their period like icecream, chocolate, etc

Enjoy
>> ARTICLE
Nooo! Season 1 was awful. All it did was make you surprisingly fond of the characters while getting a few laughs, which would be good build up for AS. After Story is definitely worth it. Not just the drama of the last 8 episodes or so but the pacing just improves monumentally 
>> ARTICLE
Uhhh... I think AS is mandatory after watching Clannad
>> ARTICLE
After story makes it better imo
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I sometimes wish Clannad had been cut down to some 4 episode summary and never been the sprawling consideration of romantic options and miscellanea that it is. Have it be merely the footing for After Story.
>> ARTICLE
But the entire beauty of Clannad is that the characters are built up so much. You get little out of it if you don't have feelings for the characters.
>> ARTICLE
I as well, did not enjoy the first season as much as people made me believe. But just started on After Story, and it is just so good.
>> ARTICLE
Go for Kanon first, Clannad Afterstory has a few Kanon references and I enjoyed Kanon much more (Made by the same people).
>> ARTICLE
Before/after watching Kanon(2006), I suggest the visual novel. It's a good one and you get the chance to choose the better girl.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone should play the game.  The reason being that that is the only way to see Makoto's arc.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, forgot that. I second this, although I prefer Nayuki and Mai's path.
>> ARTICLE
Just adding something: If you decide to watch Kanon make sure to get the remake from 2006. The first anime adaptation was rather cheap.
>> ARTICLE
It saddens me that very few of these comments actually answered your question.

Romance is there but it is neither the focus nor the best aspect of CLANNAD. 

10% Romance 40% Drama %25 Comedy %25 Slice of Life (SoL)


>> ARTICLE
I'm a 17 year old guy and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
>> ARTICLE
Same.

>> ARTICLE
Let me put it this way, the only thing I disliked about Clannad is the lack of Ichinose Kotomi love. SHE'S THE BEST GIRL DAMMIT!
>> ARTICLE
>Though i doubt i will cry :P

dude. i'm telling you right now. you will cry. at least twice.

Its very good. Im a 23 male and I loved it. Its deep shit bro

I didn't like it, but most people do.

The first series (Clannad) is mostly episodic looks at different characters and the protagonists trying to solve their problems (family issues, etc). The second series is the pinnacle of the series, and the second half features some of the best character building in any show.
>> ARTICLE
25 year old male here. saw clannad last year. cried. worth it. must watch.

I'd have picked Tomoyo .. so the short arc she has was more satisfying for me, was very glad they made an extra episode just for that.

10/10
>> ARTICLE
I'm not ashamed to admit it made me cry.  I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
There's plenty of drama towards the latter bits. 
>> ARTICLE
The first season is more drama/comedy. In the second season it shifts away from the comedy and focuses more on drama.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I watched Clannad as an 18 year old guy who is not an anime freak. I'm pretty grounded when it comes to anime and tend to watch things with interesting premises (from generally lighthearted shows like Angel Beats! to darker ones like Fate/Zero).

I thought Clannad S1 was awful, so beware of that. To an 18 year old who doesn't care for slice-of-life anime life it just sucks. It's rather funny at times, but the romance is awful and the drama is right there too. It's way too melodramatic and much of nothing happens. However, I do sincerely believe After Story is worth it. It's absolutely fantastic. Drunk Nagisa was one of the funniest things I watched, and yeah the second half is absolutely brilliant. 9.4/10, only thing preventing a 10/10 was a weaker beginning and a unsatisfying ending
>> ARTICLE
If you have a soul, you will most likely cry...
>> ARTICLE
It will throw some pretty funky feels into you man.
>> ARTICLE
Ok guys, i have now seen 4 episodes... really liking it. I had heard the credit song (dango, dango, dango...) a while ago and had no idea what it was from! Loving it so far and its only gonna get better from here! 
>> ARTICLE
Clannad has more comedy, AS has more drama. There isn't a ton of romance really, just enough to point out who is in love with who and to progress the story. If you start to dislike it before you get about 10 episodes or so in just try to push through it.

>Thanks for the responses guys, sounds like I'll definitely have to watch it. Though i doubt i will cry :P

Don't doubt it, it's inevitable.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad and After Story are truly beautiful animes, sure there is romance, but there is a hell of a lot of drama too, and comedy. Sunohara and Akkio always made me laugh.  
>> ARTICLE
I have to say, I absolutely loved Clannad, however, it was just not crying worthy, my friend who cried throughout the whole thing tells me that you can't enjoy it unless you cry. He's an asshole.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a 17 year old guy and i like it so far i have watched all of clannad and am on afterstory i think it is pretty good
>> ARTICLE
What makes a show like Clannad great instead of just good, is how it improves upon re-watching. After your first run through and a bit of rest, I suggest going through the journey again--you will see then that the meaning of the first season changes abruptly. You will notice all the little hints of deeper meaning and connections between everything that happens between season one and two.

(some non-specific spoilers follow)

Season one becomes much stronger and better upon review, it no longer just seems like an simple episodic comedy--you know the characters now (especially Kyou, Ryou and Tomoyo) and their behaviors make much more sense, become more romantic and sad. The first time through, Tomoya's father just seems weak and pitiful, then the second time through your feelings change to understanding the depths of his tragedy and loss. 

If you only know Nagisa from the first season (or are just a die-hard hater), she is a rather weak-willed, slight little girl, but after AS, one can see, if willing, her inner strength, her love and commitment and her patience. At first, she seems to be the meek follower, but then you realize that she is the motivation that drives Tomoya to do good things--she's actually running the show, guiding Tomoya into being a better person not by bossing him around but by her gentle ways.

Haha, I finished it about a week after I posted this :P tbh, I liked it but i didn't cry... It wasn't that amazing in my opinion. I might watch it again in a few months and see if my opinion changes.

It a great series but be warned after you watch CLANNAD and start watching After story you will (and I can't stress this enough) you will contract a Dango pillow size knot in your throat and cry the manliest tears you've ever shed...manly tears.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I watched it a few years ago, but still love it at 17. I found the first season to be more focused on comedy, while After Story has an emphasis on drama. Romance throughout.

...and yeah, tears will be shed.
>> ARTICLE
Shit I watched it and I'm 21 and I consider it one of my all time favorite anime. 
>> ARTICLE
If all the people here have not driven home the point yet, watch it.  It is a great series, great story, and a great tear jerker.

Don't let someone say to you that it isn't manly or something, who cares when the story is well worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Watched this when I was 16... cried like a baby.... One of the top series on my list.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is my favorite series (or just show in general for that matter) ever. I can not urge you enough to watch it. I've heard some girls (who love it too) from my class calling it a "chick-flick", whilst I do understand in some way... I disagree. It's a perfect mix of humor & drama with an amazing story.
I'll repeat myself, I can not urge you enough to watch it 
>> ARTICLE
I just watched it as a 17 year old guy..Clannad and after story are a good watch!
>> ARTICLE
The whole series (Clannad + After Story) is like 50 episodes, so try to find a time when you're motivated enough to watch it, because it's a pretty huge commitment.

It's very, very good.
>> ARTICLE
To a 17 year old male, Clannad will be more interesting. I watched it when I was 19 so some of the high school anime stuff was wearing thin. I still enjoyed it but I didn't feel the same connection to the school stuff. 

I watched After Story over a year later and found it much more rewarding to an older viewer. I felt a much stronger connection to Tomoya and his challenges. Overcoming things and stuff in the real world. Living in a shitty apartment. It also has a special place due to his battles with loss and depression, though I fear I've said too much.

edit: I don't like Fuko. It's a boring story and takes far too long. This is not an isolated opinion, just an unpopular one here. If you don't like those, the rest gets much better.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it as a male in their younger 20s and I enjoyed it. Without revealing much, the first season (aka, Clannad) is kind of light on romance. There is some, but not much. It has some good humor. The second season (aka, After Story) has a lot less humor and more drama, but by then you're hooked.

I wouldn't say either season has much romance. Some, yes, but not stifling amounts. I watched it with my wife who was actually frustrated by the lack of it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm 19 and I thought it was a really good anime. You should give it a try.

I'm 17 and enjoy it very much, I find myself laughing super super hard. plus there's some feels.

Clannad is a must see anime.. no questions about it... anime fans need to watch it..
>> ARTICLE
This is one of the few shows, ever, that have made me cry like a little baby. It's great, but very sad at times.
>> ARTICLE
it's a story about family, growth and coming to terms with different aspects of life and making the most out of it. there's romance and there's also harem aspects but the focus is something far deeper than some kids learning to confess their feelings for each other.
>> ARTICLE
I was 17 when I watched it. First time anything fictional has ever made me legitimately cry. It's also pretty damn funny at times, so I highly recommend it.

^^...I ^^loved ^^the ^^romance, ^^too
>> ARTICLE
I have never cried to the point where I have broken down when watching anime. I truly recommend you watch Clannad and Clannad: After Story. Truly well deserved rankings and ratings that it has earned.

Im 16 year old guy that DOES NOT CRY!!! EVER! dont know why just never happened. I was getting glossy eyed in all of after story, and was started crying in the middle. It is amazing. A must watch!

You should watch it as soon as possible. It only hits harder with age.

I thought afterstory was pretty bad. The entire second half was a 'force you to feel bad' plot and I cant air all my problems with the show because of spoilers.

disagreed. I thought E20 was cheap, or whatever the surrpise one was.

I thought some of the scenes were quite well done, like with Tomoya's  dad (that's not much of a spoiler)

Don't underestimate japanese animation pleb. 
>> ARTICLE
I would recommend the official dub because it's halfway decent, and I think that hearing the native language places the viewer more alongside the character than reading the subs (which places me more in observer-mode), and it's essential for an anime like Clannad.

That's just me though.
>> ARTICLE
English is not the native language, Japanese is.  And I really would NOT want to listen to the horrible dub-actors constantly screwing things up in a show that is all about emotion.
>> ARTICLE
He meant the viewer's native language, not the show's.

And the dub was fine, the only difference I even notice while watching it is that one version is in English and the other is in Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
I see your point. To each his own though, I usually can't get immersed in the environment unless it's a good dub (I don't know how to phrase it - some feeling is lost from listening to something I can understand to reading something I can understand), and I'm willing to sacrifice the decrease in VA quality and anything that's lost in translation for it - incidentally shows like Clannad and the currently ongoing Little Busters! are shows where I would really prefer a decent dub to a sub.

I have, but nothing in the rest of the entire VN hit me like that scene. I guess there are some moments, like [SPOILER](/s "Shirou having to kill Saber") But nothing hits harder than [SPOILER](/s "your favourite character being brutally murdered")

Overall I'd say I had more feels in UBW than HF. HF probably has the most interesting story (and the most Illya), but it's way too drawn out and the pacing is all over the place. Also I am not a big fan of Sakura, she annoys the hell out of me [SPOILER](/s "I wish she died at the end"). The feels at the end of UBW were a lot stronger than at the end of HF.

WA2's characters just feel so human. And therefore they act and do human things, and it ends just hurting. It feels like they could have been your classmates or someone you knew. And something about that doesn't just let tears flow like Clannad AS, but hits you somewhere deeper.

Pretty much my feelings. I finished it last night, and I didn't cry, but man do I feel depressed. What a show though.

Yea probably will be in my top 5 forever. I ended up reading an indepth summary for the subsquent VNs to learn what ends up happening to characters because I was so invested.

The World God Only Knows... for such a hilarious and enjoyable anime, I was completely thrown off  by that ending. I just couldn't it back.

Monogatari: Second Season

Clannad: After Story

I was told Angel Beats would also have tearful moments but I really didn't connect with them the way I did with Monogatari and Clannad. I believe it is because Angel Beats is very fast (13eps) and perhaps I wasn't as attached to the characters the way I was with the previous two.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't cried yet but I feel like I probably will after Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso ends. I only got back into anime in the last few months after a 8 year hiatus, so its the first romance anime I'm unable to simply marathon through like I have been doing with all other completed series, so I feel like that will make more impact.

You need to find a fairly entertaining, light-hearted series to brighten your spirits up. Avoid things that tend to get too deep

* Arakawa Under the Bridge

* Baka to Test

* Gintama (can actually get pretty emotional, but in the epic shounen way)

* K-ON!

* Lucky Star
>> ARTICLE
IGO SOCCER IS THE COOLEST THING TO EVER EXIST. THANK YOU FOR SAYING NICHIJOU~!!!!!!!!!!

I came here to suggest K-ON or Nichijou. Your list is better.
Light hearted plotless lulz are the best antidote to the emotional overload of Clannad Afterstory.
>> ARTICLE
I tried finding something that was as fun as Lucky Star but have always failed =[

After an intense game of iny-mini-miney-moe I've decided on Nichijou. Thanks for the ideas!

That was very clever. Good job.

When I was done with Code Geass, I would watch the abridged version on youtube (Code MENT). I laughed a bit and it cheered me up.

So I suggest just looking for some comical scenes in Clannad (i.e drunken nagisa)

Mitsudomoe or ARIA

Aria is one of my hands down favorite series and is light hearted and go-with-the-flow, but I'm not sure it would snap you out of a Clannad / After Story marathon. As a guy with a day job, it makes me question my life A LOT and wether I enjoy my surroundings enough.
>> ARTICLE
Mitsudomoe all the way. One of the few anime that made me laugh nonstop.
>> ARTICLE
I usually use Baka to test to cleanse me of depression lol. 
>> ARTICLE
Whenever I watch something serious, I always make it a point to have something light-hearted as well to watch when necessary. Currently, that show is YuruYrui

Honestly, I focused on school and tried to keep myself occupied. And I started Code Geass the next week, so that was a pretty good distraction.

T_T I marathon'd the show cause I have no work for a few days and I'm not in school.... I think i just made my own special version of hell.

Curl up in a ball, then cry a bit. 

Maybe later you can try re-watching emotional scenes until your heart gives out.

Afterwards, try destroying your ego playing Rin's path in Katawa Shoujo.

watch another anime its just how you gotta do it
>> ARTICLE
Keep watching my friend, just keep watching. After watching both Clannad and AS i decided that i enjoyed the romance genre and started watching more and more going from Angel Beats! to School Days, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I felt emotionally broken for a good week or two after watching Clannad.

I recommend you take a short break from anime, because anything you watch immediately after Clannad will likely suck in comparison.

After that break, watch something light-hearted and fun.  If you watch a drama, then you'll just find yourself comparing the story and characters to Clannad's.  I recommend you watch K-ON!.  It's a highschool anime like Clannad, but it's a comedy and there's no love story or anything like that.  It's all about comedy, music, and friendship, with a touch of emotion (but nothing on the scale of Clannad).
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly what I did, actually. It worked wonders.
>> ARTICLE
While you're still in that emotional state, I invite you to review some of the more powerful scenes in some AMV's I made.

<3 Clannad Forever.

>> ARTICLE
Watched them both. Wasn't big on the first one, but the 2nd one was great. Big fan of the editing and the song choice. I really liked the drum part where he was running to Nagisa under the sakura trees.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I finished the first season, but am terrified of watching the After Story. Everyone says it's emotionally draining. Should I watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yes you should watch it, and yes it is emotionally draining. It's a lot more serious than the first season. The first season had me crying a little during times, but the second one had me physically gasping for air while crying, super lip quiver going on. **BUT** It is amazingly well done. The first season was almost just a set up for AS. Also, I don't think I will ever get this emotionally invested in another show again. Hell I don't think I've been this emotionally invested in more than a handful of things in real life. **TL;DR Asking if you should watch After Story is like buying a bike frame and asking if you should buy wheels.**
>> ARTICLE
Okay, *gulp*, I'll do it.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone who gives up after watching Clannad and does not watch Afterstory is robbing themselves of some much needed closure.
>> ARTICLE
No you don't, you need to bask in it and it will become happiness eventually! Soon you will no longer cry at nagisa's death because you realize at the end everything is okay. I wish i could go back to being depressed. But now i only cry a little at ushio's crying on tomoya, but strangely enough most my waterworks even now is tomoya's making up with his dad.
>> ARTICLE
take a break from anime, let it sink in.  Don't forget what you've seen, you've been changed forever.  Go appreciate how beautiful the world is.  The next time something gets you depressed all you have to do is hum dango daikazoku and you'll smile through your tears.
>> ARTICLE
Key music is always so incredibly beautiful. The Rewrite soundtrack is my personal favorite though. Nice work, the medley sounds quite cohesive.
>> ARTICLE
Animenz is absolutely unmatched in transcription quality. And he is still getting better, just amazing.

Also you should read the video description, it really shows how much he puts into his work.
>> ARTICLE
Description for the lazy and for those who rely on RES video thumbnail thing to watch the video. 

So, there it is: one of the most anticipated anime covers of all time: Tori no Uta, Last Regrets and Toki wa Kizamu no Uta - all three songs packaged in one single movement: The key anime piano suite.

2 months ago, in March 2015, I wanted to upload three videos at once, as a special feature, to commemorate 300.000 subscribers of my channel.
The original line up were the full version songs of Tori no Uta, Last Regrets and Toki wa Kizamu no Uta, the three Opening themes from the legendary key anime series Air (TV), Kanon (2006) and Clannad After Story.

Famous songs like these put a lot of pressure on me of course, because I definitely had to deliver a piano cover worthy of the name "Animenz". 
The pressure was like... well, just imagine you are a conductor. And one day, you have been told to conduct beethoven's 9th symphony, a world-famous and well known music piece, loved by many.
Just imagine the pressure.
Threrefore, as an anime pianist, it was an great challenge to transcribe these three legendary songs. And that's why I wanted to create the most accurate, most intriguing, and - above all - most emotional piano sheet possible. 

At first I made good progress, and quickly created a basic draft for each of these three songs. However, after writing out the TV-size, I quickly ran out of ideas for the rest of the song. I couldn't think of a variation of the chorus and simply copy pasting everything was just too plain. 
I sat on the sheet for hours, for days, I couldn't even sleep because of that, but my ideas just didn't worked out in the sheet. I was in a hopeless situation. I tried and tried but to no avail.

And one day, in the middle of march, I just broke down. I couldn't do it anymore. I wanted to quit, I wanted to forget, I didn't want to accept my failure, but.. I just don't know anymore. In the end I dropped the three sheets, and felt depressed for the whole month.
I failed and I couldn't meet the expectations.

Then, more than a month later - while I was taking a walk near the sea - I was listening to my usual anime music with my headphones, and upon hearing Dango Daikazoku, my mind suddenly exploded and I had a moment of enlightment:
I'll just "recycle" the three abandoned TV-sized sheets and create a piano medley instead. 
I immediately rushed back and began to work on the medley, working title "key anime piano suite". 
I have extended the 1:30 min TV size by reusing some motifs in the original song, and created some transitions as well to give the song a better flow.
The entire sheet underwent more than two hundred edits until every single note is polished, until I am finally satisfied with every single detail.

5 years.
I actually wanted to cover these three songs for five long years, since the very beginning of my youtube channel, which I started in November 2009. Along with My soul, your beats! - the Angel Beats OP - these were the piano covers I've always dreamed of.
And now, the sheet has finally been created. Finally.

Thank you for reading this long wall of text, because this key anime piano medley, was probably one of the greatest challenges I have ever faced so far in my anime pianist career on youtube. 
With this weight lifted from my shoulders, I can finally take a breather again. (Time to marathon some anime tonight!)
Well then, I hope you enjoyed this special "key anime piano suite" and I hope that the music has also touched your heart - same as the three key anime series has touched mine.

Dango Daikazoku is my favorite ED of all time, i catch myself often humming the tune at work, and it always reminds me of clannad witch is also, one of my favorite anime.

Man, if there's a weirdly specific thing I love is nice piano arrangements of anime songs. They tend to sound so... I don't know, satisfying?
>> ARTICLE
This was amazing. Great job! 
>> ARTICLE
One day I will finally watch Air and complete the trilogy.
>> ARTICLE
key - I love their stuff, but I haven't seen too much of it.
I've seen Angel Beats and Clannad/After Story, as well as the Air (possibly my favourite) and Clannad movies. I've also watched 1 episode of Little Busters, 2 episodes of Air (TV) and 7 of Kanon (Kyoani)
One of the strongest points is definitely the music, and this is a really great arrangement.
>> ARTICLE
I just cant not cry at any rendition of Toki wo Kizamu Uta, this was no exception, that song is just so packed with emotions for me.
>> ARTICLE
Really good overall.

But I didn't feel in tone with those right handed variations from 1:33, it's like they had a different mood that didn't fit my image of Tori no Uta.
>> ARTICLE
Sample size is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too small if you're saying these are r/anime's favorite anime. 66/179,335 total users and even 66/1775 currently active
>> ARTICLE
I can't sticky the topics sadly. If people don't upvote them, they're not going to get a lot of views. 65 votes was much better than I actually expected to be honest. I'm happy with the turn out for voting. The nomination turn out was a little disappointing on the other hand.

Fate Zero vs SAO are you serious
>> ARTICLE
If Fate/zero doesn't win I don't know anymore....
>> ARTICLE
With a current season driving up the hype level, I would be very surprised to see Fate/Zero hit round two.
>> ARTICLE
The story in Fate/Zero is better written than SAO. Its just that SAO has a story that applies to most gamers and younger audiences. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I disagree lol. While Fate/Zero is a great anime no doubt and is one of my favorites, I actually prefer SAO. SAO holds a special place in my heart :P
>> ARTICLE
Sao has immense popularity
>> ARTICLE
Fate zero sold alot more copies than SAO.
>> ARTICLE
If you've seen both, you'd be crazy not to choose Fate/Zero, but if you haven't seen Fate/Zero...well, you should vote for it anyways because it's that good. But depending on the voting audience I could see either a lot of popularity for SAO or hatred, so it could go either way.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen both. I like both. 
>> ARTICLE
I like both (despite SAO's flaws), and can't wait to see what SAO 2 has in store, but Fate/Zero was a masterpiece whereas SAO was just entertaining and mostly enjoyable. My opinion, of course, I just don't think F/Z and SAO should be compared for popularity because it would be unfair to either and they are very different shows.
>> ARTICLE
I would not go so far to call Fate/Zero a masterpiece. It was a great show but it had its flaws as well. It also has not endured the test of time, but I personally think it will. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, it's not perfect but it's still one of the few anime I've seen that are a solid 10/10 for me.

So disappointed to see that Naruto beat out Gintama.  Travesty that one.
>> ARTICLE
I was really surprised. I would expect Naruto to win if we asked a general population, but for just /r/anime users to pick it was kind of weird. Gintama topics probably outnumber Naruto topics 5 to 1.
>> ARTICLE
that also maybe because naruto has its own very active subreddit so most discussion gets directed there. 
>> ARTICLE
There were 0 perfect brackets after day 1. Gintama messed up most people, while Black Butler took down the rest.
>> ARTICLE
If I had seen this in time I would have predicted every day 1 except NHK vs Darker than Black.
>> ARTICLE
I like polls, but honestly I think only people who have seen both shows completed should be allowed to vote.


Only in 2 of the 8 did I actually watch both and vote for the one that I felt was better, the other 6 I just voted for the one I watched over the one I hadn't.


Assuming other people are doing the same thing, the mainstream shows will all win.


The way it should work is something like:

Q1: Did you watch anime X?

Q2 (Reveals only if Q1 = yes): Was it great (yes/no)?

Q3: Did you watch anime Y?

Q4 (Reveals only if Q3 = yes): Was it great (yes/no)?

Q5 (Reveaks only if Q1=yes & Q3 = yes): Which anime was better, X or Y?


From those questions you get how many people watched each, what % of people who watched them thought they were great, and most importantly, which of the two the people who watched both liked more.

I was not expecting this kind of turn out. We're nearing 500 votes. Unfortunately we hit the pay window on SurveyMonkey multiple times.

I'm surprised that *Ping Pong the Animation* ended up with a seed of 16.

The seeding was decided using data from MAL. I added together the rank and popularity of each anime and the lower the total, the better the seed. While Ping Pong is rated highly, not many people have seen it. I think its popularity ranking is like 1200.

So, how do I vote/contribute to this?

>> ARTICLE
Voting for day 3 will be open in a couple hours. You can also click on the Predict bracket link to enter the bracket challenge, but your bracket will be marked as late since 2 groups have already been decided. The voting for day 2 has concluded due to too many votes for the free version of the website I was using. I'll be using a different website for day 3 so we won't run into that problem.
>> ARTICLE
So from now on are you are using Strawpoll website? Becaue I think for bracketmaker you need an account. (which is not a problem, I'll gladly make an account if I can contribute)

Strawpoll for voting and Bracketmaker to keep track of results/prediction challenge. You can vote for the next set of 8 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2adfju/anime_tournament_day_4_death_bebop_bracket_voting/). No account needed for voting. If you want to predict a full bracket, you'll need to register for bracketmaker.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you, and good work.
>> ARTICLE
Did not realize this was going on. Honestly if you are having a problem with voter turnout then you should be giving more than 1 day for voting. Most polls on r/anime get a lot more responses than this.

Looking at the bracket I see some nasty matchups coming up. Psycho-Pass is one of my favorites, but I doubt it stands much chance against the AOT fanbase. Code Geass vs Ping Pong is an unfortunate matchup, as is Hunter X Hunter vs Rurouni Kenshin. KLK vs NGE is not even fair. 

Also interesting choice of having When They Cry rather than Higurashi. I don't know whether this will hurt or help it. On the one hand that means it includes Umineko. If people have played the VN then this will be a huge positive, if they are judging based on the anime, it's a negative. On the other hand, many people might just have no idea what When They Cry is.
>> ARTICLE
It only makes sense to have the voting for longer than a day if the topic gets upvoted. If it gets downvoted, then no one sees it after it leaves the first page of "new." Once that happens, it doesn't matter how many days I leave voting open for.  This was the first topic for the tournament that actually got upvoted.

This one seems a bit more weighted. The only ones I could see being very close are 7 and 3. How did that garbage unfunny sex joke "comedy" NouCome make it in the pole anyway? Sometimes /r/anime makes me cringe. 
>> ARTICLE
I like S;G but I like Noucome more and I voted for it.

It didn't help that the second half of S;G was spoiled for me before I watched it, though.

>> ARTICLE
Match 5 could be close too, it's nostalgia factor vs. hype factor. 

I'm interested to see what wins out. 

I'm voting Dragon Ball, but it could go either way.
>> ARTICLE
1. Steins;Gate
2. Spice and Wolf most probably
3. Ouran because Hakusho is from the 90s and we all know that 90s animations *sucks* according to /r/anime
4. Baccano! since a lot more people have seen it and isn't the mediocrity that's Noragami.
5. This will show how many new fans are here.
6. Pretentious trainwrecks ahoy! Madoka will win since it's just done better.
7. Kuroko will probably win, unless people with taste come in.
8. Both have only 11-13 episodes I give a fuck about, but since Railgun S doesn't pretend to be coming of age with a fucking reset ending, gets my vote. However hype demands that Clannad wins by default.

Popularity contests are so fun [](/s "not")
>> ARTICLE
At least it's not a popularity contest pretending to be some objective competition figuring out the best of the best. It's just a poll of /r/anime favorites, and there's nothing wrong with that, unless of course all you're going to do is bitch and moan in about how /r/anime has such shit taste, in which case feel free to get the fuck out. 

I'm all for breaking the circlejerk and giving popular shows some legitimate criticism, but there's a difference between that and being a condescending ass. You're opinion is not the right opinion, because that's not how opinions work. That applies to all of the rabid fanboys here, and everyone that thinks they're better than said fanboys  because they don't like a lot of popular shit.

That's not directed entirely at you, but in general I'd love for everyone to stop being so close-minded and condescending, and just accept the fact that everything is subjective, and people like what they like for a reason. That's not to say we shouldn't debate about what's the best, we just all need to stop being so condescending about it(again, everybody, not just you). 

Sorry for being a preachy asshole, and I'd also like to say that I did up-vote you. While I do tend to disagree, and you did come off as condescending, it's nice to see a deviation from the usual circlejerk that goes on around here. 
>> ARTICLE
I only find the Kuroko vs Shinsekai Yori comment condescending, the others aren't directed to people(even the Clannad one I'd argue). It's just that simple entertainment is valued over a good memorable piece of storytelling. It is how it is, but it still irks me.

And I honestly do see little point to this. Sure, it can be fun, but anyone who's been here for just a few months can easily tell what will be voted and what not.

BTW Shinsekai Yori has yuri in it, get on that /r/anime! :D

Agreed. Onions... Onions everywhere, also, thanks I'll check out Anohana.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the original series until I played the game. Once I did that I realized how much they changed Tomoya's character and the feel of the interactions between the characters. I still like the original series, but the characters in the game are just so much better done.
>> ARTICLE
I'm playing the game currently and I can agree with you that they did indeed change Tomoya a great deal but the characters in the game are still excellent.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished this recently myself.  I would like to borrow your thread to explain my response as well. 

I too cried a bit during the aforementioned scene, that and a few others. Prior to this I believed myself to be an emotional rock, unable to be moved by events other than those dealing with severe depressive themes. This has some of that but I think it was well executed enough that it did not matter.  If this series had a description, I would write it as "This will make a grown man cry like a little girl and still love it". It was mildly spoiled for me, but I convinced myself that what I saw was just a troll trying to lie to me. All in all I think it is worth a watch and I feel richer for the experience. There you go, you can have your thread back, I give you upvotes. 
>> ARTICLE
No problem vent away! That's kind of what I got from it when I said I related to it. The event's themselves have no real relation to me but the emotional roller-coaster portrayed I know all to well. It put a new light on familliar issues. Helps you understand, if that makes any sense.

you cried? well, who didn't?

You started off with the best of Key, imo.

Kanon and Air are still very high up there though. Watch them soon too, along with stuff like Makoto Shinkai's films and of course AnoHana as has already been said.
>> ARTICLE
Could you elaborate on "Kanon and Air" please? I'm still new and would like to check them out. Just full names would be fine, I don't need a synopsis or anything :P
>> ARTICLE
Sure! Kanon (2006) was a remake of Key's previous sereis, although titled... Kanon. It's about a teenager who goes to live with his cousin and attend her high school, while remembering some important things there.

Air TV is about a wanderer who comes to find the 'harem' in a city while near the beach.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome thank you! I'll be sure to add them to my already massive "to watch list".
>> ARTICLE
> and that scene in the flower fields was emotinal! I very rarley cry to any forms of media, but a few manly tears were shed. It's an amazing story that I somehow found I could relate to on an emotional level

and after that scene  while they were on the train talking about Nagisa. i stopped crying and then they pulled out Tomoya tell that story about Nagisa... that entire episode was filled with tears... 

that one line "It's the one you chose and bought for me.
First thing from Daddy" literally everything i had that was stopping me from crying like a baby just crumbled. even as i'm writing this i feel like i want to tear up....

Iknowrite!? There was about 3 seperate times where I let it out. The third time was right before the big change in the ending where such and such passes out in the streets during winter. WHY MUST HE GO THROUGH SO MUCH PAIN?!

It's making my eyes water just thinking about it again.
>> ARTICLE
All of After Story is so damn depressing, especially the end. God damn. I watched the whole of Clannad before After Story and it wasn't anywhere near as bad. It was much more mysterious, but still pretty cheerful and fun. I say you let yourself off easy with watching After Story first. The only downside being you really have no idea about Fuko.
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering about Fuko. She kind of appeared out of nowhere.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I'm sure you'll be wanting more anime to provide the feels. I don't know what you've watched but here are some anime that is similar to Clannad's appeal.

[Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien](http://myanimelist.net/anime/147/Kimi_ga_Nozomu_Eien)

[Welcome to NHK](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/NHK_ni_Youkoso!)

[Nana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/877/Nana)

[Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time)

[Toradora](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!)

I absolutely loved Clannad and wanted to find shows that gave me feels like Clannad did. So here are some that delivered. I have more to recommend if you'd like but these are my top picks that are the most similar to Clannad.
>> ARTICLE
I just (10 minutes ago) finished Nana, and I feel this has to be said - [only spoiling about anime/manga hiatus, read at will](/s "the anime is good but doesn't have an ending. The Manga is on hiatus and thus the anime is, too (though the anime does about 6/10ths of the manga as far as I can tell). Personally I found it frustrating.")
>> ARTICLE
I was a little disappointed that part as well. But I feel like the ending suffices. Especially to justify the ride that show takes you.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you . I'll check these out. Already saw NHK and loved it too.
>> ARTICLE
Great! If you specifically want shows that occur after Highschool check out Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien, Nana and Golden Time. Please please don't be discouraged by the art styles haha. Trust me, they were all problems for me before I started the shows. But my personal favorite is Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien out of all of those. 
>> ARTICLE
The only bad thing is that you've peaked and now it's all downhill from here. 
>> ARTICLE
There plenty of other anime as good if not better!
>> ARTICLE
Then I don't seem to find them.
>> ARTICLE
I am sure you have several 10s, aren't they as good as Clannad? Perhaps you haven't watched enough yet. On mobile app so cannot check your MAL profile to know.
>> ARTICLE
I have many 10s but for exemple i gave a 10 to Shinsekai  yori and death note ,  which are my least favorite 10/10 while clannad is in my top 3.
>> ARTICLE
All that's left is Clannad's really long visual novel.
>> ARTICLE
The first English translation is awful (especially in AS, it's partly machine translated!).

I'd wait for the translation that's currently in work and almost finished. They hired professionaly translators this time (with money from kickstarter).
>> ARTICLE
That's good news. I hope it's ready by the time I pick it up.
>> ARTICLE
Most likely november, but certainly before 2016.

>> ARTICLE
This episode to me is like the pieces of a beautiful puzzle fitting together perfectly. The illusionary world, the girl and the robot, the orbs of light, the town, Nagisa's play, their meeting, all of it comes together and paints a wonderful image about love, family, change, bonds, reciprocation, an image that is moving and inspiring - that image is Clannad.

Clannad is about Tomoya's development, the story of how he learns the real meaning of family, and how he grows as a person. The scene this episode where he's reliving his first encounter with Nagisa and contemplating never meeting her but in the end turns around as the world regains its color in a mirror of the first episode and dashes towards her, refuses to let go, is an amazing scene that is essential in showing how far he's come. 

The supernatural elements to Clannad don't come out of nowhere, they aren't out of place, and they definitely aren't detrimental to the show. Much to the contrary, they're well established, strongly foreshadowed, and play an important role from start to finish. I completely disagree with the notion of there being anything wrong with the ending we're given as a result of such elements, and as explained, I believe it's fantastic and perfect the way it is.

I'll probably get downvoted for this but 5 cm Per Second was overrated. It might have made me cry if it wasn't so boring to watch.

Hmm. I really liked it, but I can understand finding it boring.

Granted, at the time that I first watched it, my girlfriend had been three thousand miles away from me for half a year...

Either way,](/spoiler) it was a bag of tears for me.

Samurai X.  Man that was depressing.  Especially after watching Rurouni Kenshin.
>> ARTICLE
Not a single mention of Gantz? Or Berserk?  
>> ARTICLE
Gantz, [when the little brother is looking for Kato during the episode he dies](/spoiler), is pretty tough.

Berserk, however, was such a badass series I grew a third ball watching it.
>> ARTICLE
You and your superfluous testicle get an upvote my friend. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, Gantz has so many of these sad scenes , that I think you start getting numb after like 160 chapters.

Berserk, [the whole Griffith scene, where he betrays Gatts/Gutts was pretty emotional. ](/spoiler)

BTW, you should really read the manga. If I remember correctly, Gantz anime stopped airing after first season? (the manga is still going..) And something similar with Berserk. 
>> ARTICLE
I've actually read most of the manga for both those series as I was curious where the story evolved at the anime endpoints.  Caught up a month or two ago and haven't checked for new chapters as I'm doing something similar with other anime series I enjoyed.  For Berserk, at least, I know they release chapters once in a fucking blue moon so at most I'm probably a chapter behind.
>> ARTICLE
Another one from the anime is [when the gang leader gets killed by Gantz and he gets that phone call from his SO that she was lactating.  When he asks if he's not needed anymore that got to me](/spoiler).  That character is completely different in the manga, you feel almost no sympathy for him there.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like that's the case with a lot of characters when it's Anime Vs Manga.

I have two: 

One is [Viral's alternate reality dream sequence](/spoiler) from Gurren Lagann 

and the other is [the Tachikoma's sacrificing themselves to save Section 9 and the scene with Motoko and Kuze right before it](/spoiler) from GiTS:2nd GiG
>> ARTICLE
Right there with you on the tachikoma sacrifice scene.  To me, the tachikoma were the most human characters in that show.

Azumanga Daioh (nobody said it had to be tears of sorrow)
>> ARTICLE
I'm a manly man, but I teared up at the end of Azumanga Daioh because it felt like their years together were too short and like I was splitting up from friends, myself. I think the nostalgia and bittersweet atmosphere of that series is frequently overlooked because of the oddness and humor.
>> ARTICLE
In Gurren Lagann, whenever "'Libera Me' from Hell" plays, I get chills and feel something that might come close to sorrow.

However, I am also a robot who has no emotion.  Beep boop.
>> ARTICLE
"Libera me from Hell" always makes me cry out of epicness. Not much else does that.

The final act of this show makes me cry man-tears, every time.

Made me cry real tears:

* 5 Centimeters per Second
* Angel Beats
* Millennium Actress

Fullmetal Alchemist (both) several times... almost.

Kanon was the worst for me, it was the first anime to make me cry. Clannad+Clannad:After Story also did. 5 Centimeters per second did, GTO did, ef - A Tale of Memories/Melodies did.

I cried during the episode in Fruits Basket when Tohru goes to visit her parents (mothers?) grave. It wasn't incredibly heart breaking, but it just happened that I saw that episode on the one year anniversary of my father's death.  
>> ARTICLE
There's a flashback where she's visiting her father's grave with her mother as a young child, but another one where she visits with her friends. I think with Fruits Basket a lot of what made me me cry were the moments I could sympathize with as well -- especially the New Years scene when they come back to stay with her for new year's T_T...
>> ARTICLE
All these semi sad scenes that require you to hold interest in the series but NO ONE mentioned Voices of a Distant Star?!?!?
WTF
>> ARTICLE
That one oddly did not make me cry, though I was deeply moved by it.  Being in a room with a bunch of other people (I watched it with my club back in college) did make it a little easier for me to take.
>> ARTICLE
This is why I try to watch anime alone. Somehow when I'm watching with my brother or with a friend I just can't get emotionally involved with the series.
>> ARTICLE
Right there with you, With my friends I just feel like crap, but alone that one tear gets away from me and I wanna punch myself in the balls for whussing out.

I have kind of blocked out how depressing that was, definitely beats everything else here. I feel that it hits a lot closer to home than most anime.

No, it was good until then, when they [gecko ended](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding) it and you could really tell. I had multiple people come up after watching it on my recommendation, and just go "that was all right mostly, but... what in the hell happened there at the end?" One went on to comment you could tell the last episode wasn't written by someone that knows how to cause pain. Not sure how I feel about the implications of that.

I'm confused now. Was the manga not finished when they made the anime?
>> ARTICLE
The 13 (+OVA) episode anime only made it only partway through the manga and decided that the next climactic thing to happen would be... well, the climax. So to give it more closure and had it kill some more characters, and do [that annoying thing with lucy at the end](/spoiler).
>> ARTICLE
Hehe, not sure if you needed that spoiler tag, it was a very subtle one :P

Does the manga have a different ending?

Off-topic, I'm kinda curios about your username, partially because it contains my last name in it :D
>> ARTICLE
I live on the edge.

As to the manga... Although some things were altered, you could say the anime covered about 65 chapters of the 107-chapter manga (which is around volume 7). [Bandou lives through that, Lucy never has a Bolivian Army Ending \(see tvtropes for this term\), and both Kurama and Mariko survive the explosion, which actually wasn't an explosion in the manga, since the bombs got disarmed (temporarily...). At this point the plot moved to being much more about the director's evil diclonius plots to destroy humanity.](/spoiler)

To be brutally honest, just about all anime makes me get teary or lump in the throat.  This is largely why I'm an anime fan: the industry really knows how to push my buttons and I am suckered in every damn time.  It would be a shorter list to think of what anime *hasn't* made me emotional at one point or another.
>> ARTICLE
Fushigi Yuugi and the Ah! My Goddess OVA made me a bit teary eyed...

I'm really into Naruto.  There are just some scenes just really got sad.  From part 1, the buildup to [Kiba's death, even though it did not happen in the end, it was very sad for me](/spoiler).  Also, in part 2, [Chiyo's death](/spoiler).  My eyes started watering on both.
>> ARTICLE
Yah, I completely agree on the Naruto as well.
>> ARTICLE
A) FFS people, downvotes for someone answering the question? All minozake was doing was informing you of an instance when he/she cried.
B) I'm the same with Naruto, especially the arc involving Gaara in Shippuuden. Also Xtv and, kinda ashamed to admit it, but Sailor Moon first and last series endings. Claymore too IIRC. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to chalk it up to Naruto not being a popular anime in this community.  I guess reddiquette is out the window ~_~
>> ARTICLE
Hating Naruto/Bleach seems to be the "Cool" thing to do lately.  
>> ARTICLE
I AM SO SICK OF THAT SHIT!!!! I refused to watch naruto up until about 3 years ago, only because i just really wasn't interested in it. Now I'm current with the Japanese releases and i admit my error. It has flaws like any other anime series but all in all it is a great series. The fact that it is hated on for being successful and having mass appeal (no matter what means are employed to achieve it) is complete B.S. 

OK... rant aside, Naruto got to me 3 times:

1: when [Hiruzen Sarutobi Dies,](/spoiler) seeing the effect reverberate through the entire village just sucked.

2: the aftermath of [Asuma's death](/spoiler) Seeing Shikamaru in tears and lamenting over [the lighter](/spoiler) was hard but I think it was in turn because he has been a hard character to relate to throughout the series and he is usually devoid of any true emotion beyond cold calculation.

3: Episode 166 when Hinata [finally confesses to Naruto](/spoiler) just before her [apparent death](/spoiler). Now this may be because I am a Hinata fan but that scene alone got to me more in the manga and I feel it should have been played up more in the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuck it I like naruto. The last episode that came out was one of the best action sequences ive seen in a while...but not the best. people are just pissy
>> ARTICLE
The Hinata episode before that was emotional one. You couldn't find a 1/10 of that on regular tv.
>> ARTICLE
No not at all. Naruto's response was perfect...flipping shit and beating pains ass. I gotta hand it to Pain though taking out the entire village and fighting him.

Except Angel Beats' last episode, which was just trying too hard.

Haibane Renmei bigtime.

Definitely Honey & Clover, Cowboy Bebop, Maria-sama ga Miteru, and Nana. Movies: a lot of studio Ghibli material, especially Whisper of the Heart and My Neighbor Totoro.

Some that probably did or almost did: Nodame Cantabille, Azumanga Daioh, and Beck. I know I'm missing some.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Haibane Renmei once... but stopped because the anime seemed kind of slow and stuff in RL had to be done, kinda forgot about finishing it... Should I give it another go?
>> ARTICLE
It's fantastic. These days, a lot less eventful slice-of-life shows are the norm. It has a lot more happening than that. Plus, it's short. Definitely give it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished watching Haibane Renmei. It was beautiful. The ending was especially chilling for me because I can sort of correlate with Reki. Except I didn't ask for help... I waited for a bit, got tired, and decided not to in the end. I still get a weird sensation throughout my body thinking of what might have happened if I waited longer.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you enjoyed it. I think just about everybody can relate to something in it, even if it's not a literal shared event. I rewatch it every couple of years when it feels like it has sufficiently left my system/memory. It's not as impacting as the first time I watched it, but it still hits hard and sticks with me for days afterward.

Just putting a Haibane Renmei wallpaper on my desktop affects my mood.

I would say third but Anohana is tied with Clannad for me.

I also recently finished the series, maybe a week ago now, not sure. I teared up a few times (FUUKO BEST GIRL) but after [After Story Spoiler](/s "Nagisa's Death") I just couldn't stop crying throughout the rest of the series.

[After Story Spoiler](/s "Ushio: "First thing from Daddy"") Oh god what did you do to me. I tear up just thinking about Clannad...
>> ARTICLE
The 2nd spoiler pushed me to the verge of tears more than anything in anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Right there with you. I quote it whenever I talk about it because I think it's just that damn powerful of a scene.
>> ARTICLE
I still get teary over the thought of that scene. D:
>> ARTICLE
Same here..it was so sad :( or [After Story Spoiler](/s "When he said good bye to his father and cried while their conversation.."). I loved it
>> ARTICLE
It was great! Right after I finished After Story, I watched Angel Beats then Anohana. I definitely recommend these two if you liked Clannad :)
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is a death trap, first half of the anime, happy go lucky banana with each of the heroine story.

Bam after story come, you cared to much for the character by this point. now you cried like a little bitch. I did, and i like it
>> ARTICLE
it was the hardest anime to finish, couldn't read the subs 
>> ARTICLE
every final scene of after story i found myself crying and yellin at the monitor: "why did you do this to me WHY?!".
10/10 would cry again.
>> ARTICLE
If you liked the emotional tone of clannad I recommend Tokyo magnitude 8.0.  Those onion ninjas man. Those bastards.  

>> ARTICLE
This show left me emotionally scarred. Lol.
>> ARTICLE
For a person who doesn't usually like moe aspects and the 'overly large eyes syndrome' in anime, Clannad really convinced me otherwise. After Story is a beautiful piece of storytelling and it's really close to my heart. I don't think I cried as much as other people, but it honestly did move me to tears. I absolutely adore it.
>> ARTICLE
Seeing images from the sunflower scene in AS still brings tears to my eyes to this day. The only show that had me a sobbing wreck each time i've watched it (3 so far with a 4th planned for some time this summer)
>> ARTICLE
we are getting into the fun part of the series. prepare to laugh your ass off!

^^/s
>> ARTICLE
Welp boys, my heart will love me for watching the next upcoming episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man you guys are up to this part, have fun :s 
>> ARTICLE
Episode 14-16. I'll be honest, when I watched this the first time it really took me like 3 weeks before I decided to watch the next episodes.. Man I was so attached to Nagisa that I just couldn't accept that happened to her. I mean, the foreshadowing was obvious, but I just refuse to believe that she's out of the story like that. Those three weeks were like hell for me. But I'm glad I managed to pull through though.
>> ARTICLE
By and large it would have to be [**Nana**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/877/Nana)[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBsHK-_afWU)  

It has some of the most well written, realistic characters in anime. And while it might not be for everyone, it definitely is *the* Shojo/Josei title to beat in terms of romance/drama genre.  

^^^^^Ai ^^^^^Yazawa ^^^^^pls ^^^^^:'(  

**EDIT:** As to why it's special to me, I think it has to do with the characters and how realistic everything feels. All the struggles faced by everyone and how everything pans out. It's so well written, that I'm inclined to say it's one of my favourite romance shows/stories in *any* medium, ever.
>> ARTICLE
In most romance anime, theres like one kiss at the end.

In Nana, things are... different
>> ARTICLE
LOL, *oh yeah.*
>> ARTICLE
Ok, you convinced me - I'll start watching NANA now, thank you!
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did :)
>> ARTICLE
I think I will, the soundtrack was "love a first sight" already. :)
>> ARTICLE
Cool! Let me know what you think once you're done, I'd love to hear your thoughts :)
>> ARTICLE
I finished it a couple days ago - and.. 
I loved the soundtrack, I thought the comedy was on point, the characters were realistic and had great development.
I disliked the ridiculous amount of recap episodes (I think episode 7 or so was the first recap - like damn, why would you do a recap at the beginning of an anime?); I also didn't not like the end, but I'll read the manga so I'll hopefully be satisfied with the manga end. Anyway I gave it a 9/10 - because of the realistic characters, well written story and the things Nana made different than other Romance-Anime. I'd definitely recommend it.

Edit: I still don't understand how they were able to animate 47 Episodes including a lot of recaps, but did not animate to the proper end of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I was confused until I realized you were talking about Nana! Not often people on here actually get back to you on stuff hahaha  

That said, I'm glad you liked it! :D I feel like the recap episodes were my bad, because they're technically standalone and I should've told you. Basically all the '.5' episodes are recaps, with them being set in an alternate space. That has to do with the manga and some of the bonus panels that came with the volume sets. Speaking of the manga, the reason why it didn't end on a complete note is because they more or less caught up to the manga. And, well, the fact of the matter is that it's not complete even as of yet. It's on hiatus, not cancelled mind you, just on hiatus. The mangaka's been intermittently ill since 2009. Sucks, but recently she's been doing some artwork for the magazine, so perhaps we might get to see the end of Nana.  

If you're going to read the manga, which I hope you do, it doesn't give you a better sense of closure but it does help scratch that itch at least temporarily, start at Chapter 40. It's a little more flushed out even though it technically ends at chapter 42.  

Even thought it's not complete, this is probably Ai Yazawa's best work and by far my favourite anime. Thanks for giving it a shot and for getting back to me! :)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for all the information! :-)
Well, I did skip the recaps - I was still confused at the beginning though. I'll definitely read the manga and I hope that it'll be finished some day.

And of course I go back to old stuff, when I promise to do! :)

Some 'fangirl' thing (eventhough I'm a boy :D) to end this comment:
I freaking loved the relationship that developed between Reira and Shin.

I'll let you know! :)
>> ARTICLE
I watched Nana and loved it, then went to read all of the manga...only to find out is on hiatus for years! And it stopped in the most important part. :( The feeling is HxH all over again
>> ARTICLE
Circa 2009 *sigh*  

I feel your pain. The Mangaka's been intermittently ill since then, but earlier this year she *did* draw some artwork for the annual calendar the magazine churns out, so perhaps soon?! I try not to raise my hopes up too high, but hope's hope right?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about you, but I feel like *Nana* is a great romantic drama for people who usually avoid the genre because it breaks free of all the usual tropes. 
>> ARTICLE
That too, I agree completely. It breaks away from the typical idealistic high-school romance that plagues the medium like no other and it does so brilliantly. I mean, I know I keep saying this, but it really is extremely well written.
>> ARTICLE
Easily Spice and Wolf.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Spice and Wolf is more of an adventure anime with minor romance aspect than a romance anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure season 3 will focus more on the romance aspect than the previous seasons.

&nbsp;

^^^please? 
>> ARTICLE
Do you really think there is going to be a season 3?

Unfortunately, I highly doubt it. It's a shame considering S&W is one of my favorite shows, but the chances of it being picked up again are definitely not in our favor.

It is a common joke around here. Everyone knows there will never be a season 3.

White Album 2; I hated but is very well made. Genji Monogatari Sennenki; very underrated/not popular historical themed romance. Yosuga no Sora; the worse romance I have ever watched, avoid it.
>> ARTICLE
I loved Furiko, if you havent seen it yet go watch it rigtt now, its only 3 minutes but they're 3 minutes full of feels
>> ARTICLE
It seems like a very complete list, but two things I would add would be(for better or worse) Bakemonogatari and Full Metal Panic!([This scene from SC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pv4RDaR0YA) felt really impactfull in the greater sense of things even if it doesn't do all that much).
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari has great romance elements in it. Though, I wouldn't call it a 'romance' anime. Each to there own though! Definitely a show I would recommend people to watch regardless!

I recently rewatched  Full Metal Panic! and didn't like it as much. Though the first time I watched, definitely know what you mean about that scene.
>> ARTICLE
I supose you're right in that both of them are not primarily watched or contain romance, but as a result of watching them I've started to feel romance anime without "propper moments" like Bake ep. 12 or the FMP scene I linked to is incomplete and lacking.

IIRC my favorite moment in Nagi-Asu was probably when [spoilers]( /s "we saw how Tsumugu and Chisaki portraying an on level, semi-symbiotic domestic life")
>> ARTICLE
> Yosuga no Sora; the worst romance I have ever watched

*Thank you!* Holy shit every time somebody suggests this for romance I want to punch something.
>> ARTICLE
It was actually kinda decent for the second and third arcs. Too bad there are so many people that fast-forward through those so they can get to the infamous Sora arc and skip past both Akira and Nao.
>> ARTICLE
I think the first two arcs were interesting family stories, with inexplicable sex scenes at the end.
>> ARTICLE
can i expend a bit on that?, I pretty much like most of the things you listed, including White Album 2.

**Shoujo:** Ao Haru Ride, Fruit Basket

**Sad:** Nagi no asukara, Ef - a tale of memories>Melodies,

**Seinen:** Golden Time, Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii

**Lighthearted:** Ano Natsu de matteru, Bokura wa minna kawaisou, Ouran high school Host Club.
>> ARTICLE
Ano Natsu de matteru Dem feels T_T
>> ARTICLE
Literally just finished Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou after leaving it in my harddrive for nearly a year now. my former impression from the first couples of eps was that it'd just remain generic and wouldn't have more to offer. Of course while on the thematically it still does but I really get why people liked it now.

It was really adorable and I just loves both the MCs (and Mayumi). I'm was completely in the mood to read/watch some romance with a cute actual nice guy MC like Usa and an equally likable/fitting female and it delivered. So glad I had a whim to try it again. Time to go read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
> White Album 2; I hated

Not a very popular opinion. Care to elaborate?
>> ARTICLE
There is always one person who asks. Here is the reasons briefly;

The characters annoyed me to the point it ruined enjoying the show. We act selfishly and we can be immature but, the degree they were made me detest them. I wanted nothing to do with them, I couldn't stand or enjoy watching it.

Also, I couldn't relate to them (I have had a life with heart break but never with such drama and such personalities).
>> ARTICLE
I liked White Album 2, but it was a bit melodramatic at points. I think fans of the genre should watch it once, but it's not for everybody.
>> ARTICLE
you're not the only one. i couldn't relate to the characters at all.
>> ARTICLE
How old are you, if I may ask? Quite a few of your favorites are fairly old so that leads me to believe you're probably over 25. which would also explain why you didn't like WA2. 

Not that any of that is a bad thing, I'm just curious!
>> ARTICLE
Not too far off, I am 24 for a little while longer!

I have rewatched all those older romances over the last few years too and they still top newer titles. However, a few have had their scores lowered, just not the ones I listed. We are talking 'best' romances here, so did not include the others. Other than the excellent newer romances I listed, there are a quite few very good ones but they didn't make the cut to be listed! There is a lot of good romances out there, I think I have seen more 'newer' romances that are good than older ones. However, for the 'best' romances, well my list said it all.
>> ARTICLE
I am the opposite. I could relate extremely well, because I've been through a similar situation. 

Everything was done in a fit of passion - and you can see that every time it happened they regretted it deeply the next morning. They didn't want to create this situation. They didn't want to hurt these people who were so close to them. 

The heart wants what the heart wants. When you think its your last chance at something, you act out in a fit of passion. 

Nobody was right, but nobody was wrong. That's what made it so real - not because people do this kind of stuff in real life, but because they don't just brush over the consequences. Because you can't just shove the blame on one person and say you're the cause of this problem. 

Can you think of dozens of ways that would have defused the situation? Sure. So can I. But we aren't the ones who have a stake in the situation. We aren't constrained by time limits and volatile emotions. 

Everyone tried their best to follow their hearts. Is that so wrong? 
>> ARTICLE
I have people present the same and similar argument every time this comes up. It is rather banal now. To me they are asinine fucking shits and I detest them. However, it is very well made and worth the mention in this thread.
>> ARTICLE
I've always thought of White Album 2 as School Days without the.. [spoiler](/s "murder and boat").
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha. That gave me a good laugh. Love it! It is written better than School Days but that is not too far from the truth!

It makes me so happy to see *Nana* mentioned in the top two posts of this thread; maybe people on /r/anime will actually watch it now!

Tamako Love Story would be the best romance anime I've seen I guess... 

It just did everything I wanted it to do. The characters are absolutely adorable and their concerns are quite understandable I think. 

I just thought it was really endearing and it perfectly fits with my naive view of romance so... I totally loved it. Watching Tamako Market a couple of days before also helped a lot as I was already familiar with the characters and I remembered almost everything that happened. 
>> ARTICLE
Do you *have* to watch Tamako Market before the movie?
>> ARTICLE
You don't *have* to, but I really enjoyed tamako market as well. There's some subtleties to character interactions that you won't pick up on without having seen the series first (as well as just how lovestruck and dedicated Mochizou is, which gives the ending a larger impact).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I guess I will watch it after-all. I've been putting it off for a while, but so many people praise Love Story, I figure it's about time.
>> ARTICLE
Try not to go into it with all the hype in your mind. Its good, but it *will* be ruined by high expectations because it is still, essentially, a moe blob love story. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll keep that in mind, besides, I do love a good moe blob story every now and then :D
>> ARTICLE
Who doesn't :3
>> ARTICLE
Mh... You don't absolutely have to watch Market in order to enjoy Love Story. A friend of mine watched Love Story and has yet to watch Market and he enjoyed Love Story a lot too so... It's not a necessity I guess.

I do recommend watching Market first though, just to know more about the characters. I think the romance benefits quite a lot from the spectator knowing what happened between the characters in Market. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I was curious because I've heard some people talk about how much better the movie was compared to ~~Love Story~~ the series. That said, I guess backstory's never a bad thing. Thanks! :)
>> ARTICLE
Love Story *is* the movie. Market is the TV series! Just clarifying a bit there!

But yeah, backstory never hurts. It's lots of fluffy stuff and sweet/funnt moments like KyoAni does so well. The reaction faces are also quite funny. 

If you don't have any particular expectations, it should be an alright anime, for sure!
>> ARTICLE
Whoops, that was my bad! I guess I just typed it wrong. I'm a huge fan of SoL, so I've been meaning to watch Tamako Market for a while. I've just always heard bad things about Market, so I was considering going straight for Love Story. Not anymore though, there's so much love for it here hahaha. Thanks! :)
>> ARTICLE
Heh, it's ok man, brain farts happen to everyone! 

And yeah, I also heard it was not quite there for a KyoAni anime, that's why I never really bothered to watch it until a friend talked about it to me. 

I don't really agree with the people saying it's bad but hey, we can't all have good taste, right? It's more or less the same good old "cute girls doing cute things" formula, with a bit more plot and romance than usual. Nothing new, but nothing to throw away either. 


>> ARTICLE
Cute girls doing cute things work man. As long as it's enjoyable and there aren't any real inconsistencies with the 'plot' and romance, I think I'll enjoy it too. Plus this way, I actually have something to watch over the weekend hahaha

Yes. The movie is a direct sequel and has no additional character development to anyone outside of Tamako and Mochizou. Without Market, Love Story is woefully incomplete because absolutely nothing is explained. With Market, on the other hand, Love Story is an incredible capstone to an underappreciated KyoAni original story.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I'll just have to watch it after-all.  

> Love Story is an incredible capstone to an underappreciated KyoAni original story.  

If you don't mind me asking, what did you enjoy about Tamako Market? I've heard people talk about how mediocre the series was and was wondering why *you* think it's under-appreciated?
>> ARTICLE
It is enjoyable, very cute and relaxing. It has great KyoAni visuals as well. Episode 9 is the bomb. Love Story tops everything off perfectly
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to make a suggestion that probably no one else will - Hyouka. The relationship between Chitanda and Oreki develops slow - you may not even notice it. But Hyouka's strongest point is it's subtlety. It doesnt need forced situations, romance flags, or awkward misunderstandings. Its just two people who become closer and closer until they reach our beautiful, chilling ending.
>> ARTICLE
Wait what ithought Hyouka doesnt have romance T_T
>> ARTICLE
Strictly speaking, it's not a romance anime. But it's there. Subtle, but there.
>> ARTICLE
is it like steins gate romance like its really small ?
>> ARTICLE
Smaller still. It's subtle, but well executed. Just don't go into it expecting a full on romantic highschool drama and you'll be fine. 
>> ARTICLE
oh alri thanks :)
>> ARTICLE
I thought the romantic tension in hyouka was leagues ahead of other animes i've seen.  Like you said, they build it slowly and realistically, but I think the animation really sells it.  There's subtle body language to their interactions that grows more intimate as the series continues and it really sells their growing relationship even if they don't hit specific flags or moments like other anime.
>> ARTICLE
Ouran High School Host Club. No contest. It was uproariously funny.
>> ARTICLE
I finished Ao Haru Ride not too long ago and it was phenomenal. I'll probably pick up the manga (I haven't read any manga before, so this'll be a first for me) unless a second season is announced.
>> ARTICLE
apparently the manga is bad, I've heard people who loved the show say that they regretted picking up the manga
>> ARTICLE
Really? I have only watched the show but I have only seen good comments about the manga.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is fine, and I've never really heard anyone call it bad- especially if they liked the show. I'm not a huge fan of either version- but i considered it worth a read/watch
>> ARTICLE
I can say I don't regret reading it. If you liked the anime there's nothing you would not like about the manga really, it continues in a similar way that the anime did.
>> ARTICLE
There are plenty of things to dislike about the manga that didn't come up in the anime. Here's how I see it, if you love sappy drama the manga is great, if you don't you should just read the last chapter for closure. [Manga spoilers](/s "The MCs start acting irrationally, love polygons appear and some serious NTR shit goes on. At the end of the manga I had stopped liking both MCs, it's a good thing that the supporting cast was fairly good (at least if you skip the love interests.)" All in all I hated the manga, but I liked the anime.") 
>> ARTICLE
Huh ok, then you and I must have liked the anime for different reasons cuz I kinda expected all that from a shoujo. The reason I even read the manga is because of the closure mainly so you are right there
>> ARTICLE
It is exactly what I don't like about shoujo manga, the genre (or target demographic w/e) has many positives but also crippling factors such as very poorly done drama. 

I have tried to like Shoujo with drama tags but I just can't, there are a few that handle it well, Dengeki Daisy is a good example; the drama isn't based on misunderstandings between characters, but on the plot itself.

>> ARTICLE
My thoughts exactly, I loved the bit the anime decided to adapt. But the rest of it was just annoying and honestly, quite disappointing. I thought I had a found, a somewhat, mature depiction of high-school romance but alas it was for naught.
>> ARTICLE
Then I guess why I liked it was because I didn't expect a mature depiction of high-school romance that is rarely seen in shoujo, I went in to find closure and found it so I'm satisfied. 
>> ARTICLE
I like Shojo, for the most part, but like you said I just expected more out of Ao Haru Ride. But hey, glad you enjoyed it! :D
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "This is my biggest gripe with how it turned out. It started off very promising, I mean even the initial love triangle was handled super well. The girls remain friends without any animosity despite them liking the same dude. It continued on with steady development for the main pairing not without drama, albeit well-paced and natural. Then it all went to shit with the new characters being introduced, they were just plot devices, wrenches to be thrown to disturb the main pairing. Combined with the MCs changing into major twats it just ruined everything. Is it so much to ask for a sweet romance story without any melodrama or love triangles? There is enough sap already.")
>> ARTICLE
Right, I agree completely. I tend to favour Josei anime/manga because, typically, you get to enjoy fairly mature and realistic takes on romance. Have you seen [ParaKiss?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/322/Paradise_Kiss)

I thought as much, then Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso took it's place.
>> ARTICLE
While it's a great anime, I wouldn't call it a great romance. It's more of a tragic musical drama. Also, none of the romance is really resolved.
>> ARTICLE
Romance remains the major drive of the characters throughout the show, even more than their love for music. That's why, even if it's not technically a romance anime, it's the most beatiful romance I've ever seen in anime (to this day).

White Album 2. Aside from the story itself which I loved, it generates a lot of discussion and controversy almost every time it's mentioned in this subreddit (just look at the top comment here). Most people either loved it or hated it because it was very well-written but it didn't pander to the audience.

I knew I'd find you here making this comment. But that's fine because it saves me the trouble of doing it myself.

You've pretty much named them all as far as I know, which is kinda my point. I don't count H&C because it is only implied. You could also add Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou to the list though by that point in the series the animation quality is so bad that it's hardly even more than the manga set to a soundtrack.

My favorite (*Toradora!*) has already been mentioned, so I'll list my second favorite:

**Ouran Koukou Host Club**!

I loved this series to death, it presents itself as a typical "highschool-Shoujo-reverse-harem-with-a-dense-MC," but it is *far* from that, I promise you. For starters, the characters were immaculate, they all evolved as the series went on and had interesting and fun personalities and back stories. Each episode was something new, the series didn't seem to heavily fall back on tropes and instead had an air of refreshing originality in regards to it's plot. As an added bonus, the humor is quite well done, too. For the most part, the romance isn't *super* heavy, but instead they build up a *massive* romantic undertone. The ending of the anime was pretty good, but I recommend giving the manga a read afterwords, because it's ending is whole lot better.
>> ARTICLE
Toradora! and SNAFU have some of the best character writing of any anime I've seen. Toradora is one of my favorite anime of any genre.

If you aren't already watching it (and you fucking should be), this season's Ore Monogatari is one of the sweetest stories I've ever seen.

Kare Kano is great, if a little low budget. Nana is great if you like more mature, realistic stories. Honey and Clover is a little light on the romance... but a great SoL that has to do with unrequited love.

*KareKano*, ended up buying (and loving) the manga.

>> ARTICLE
Rant! Rant! Rant!
>> ARTICLE
Okay, if you want. There are several things I don't like about this show:

1. The male love interest. This guy is way too perfect. He has absolutely no flaws, so I refer to him as Gary Stu-kun. He excels at everything he does, be it academics, athletics, service, or staring moodily out of a window in his condo. He's the bestlooking, funniest, smartest, friendliest, richest and most athletic guy around. Even his only supposed character flaw, that he's a mysterious loner with no friends (I mean seriously, he's all that but doesn't even have a single friend?), makes him even more perfect to be the love interest in a Shojo romance, because this way he has something the main girl (and the girl who watches it) can fix and wants to fix, show him true love and all that stuff. And as an added bonus, the fact that he doesn't have any friends means that he'll focus all his attention on his girlfriend, so she doesn't have to share him with friends or other girls. Usui is 100% pure female fanservice, the equivalent of the klutzy and shy girl with the good cooking skills and the big boobs in harem shows.

2. The main girl. She's supposed to be a strong independent woman who don't need no man, but apparently this means "treat all guys like shit". Though to be fair, there's not a single decent guy in this entire show apart from Gary Stu-kun and the former chubby guy. All the other guys are either horrible over-the-top bad guys or complete wimps. Btw did you notice that there's not a single evil girl? No bitchy cheerleader-type, no rich [ojou-sama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdQGWEvhveg), not even a rival for Gary Stu-kun's love. All the girls are nice, friendly and helplessly exposed to the evil boys unless MC-chan saves them. But I digress. The main girl wants to be tough and strong, but she mostly appears as an arrogant bitch, and the moment any sort of trouble pops up she becomes completely helpless and has to wait for Gary Stu-kun to be her knight in shining armor and save her from the clutches of evil, thereby completely overwriting her only character trait that made her stand out among all the wet noodles of shoujo romance MC-chans. There was one episode where the class was preparing for a culture festival or whatever. When the guys in her class made a proposal what to do for the festival, they got shot down immediately. It was a stupid proposal, sure, but after that she just completely ignored anything the guys said, any other proposals or complaints, while still ordering them around and depending on them to do everything. When the guys finally had enough of her attitude and quit, the whole thing started to fall apart. But again, lucky for MC-chan, Gary Stu-kun came to her rescue and helped her to get back the mean boys who had just abandoned all the poor girls.

3. [This song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeICjkrcp2w) It's a great song, I won't deny that. But unfortunately the producers noticed that as well, so they used it at every possible occasion, whenever something "big" and "epic" happened. Now, this is a shoujo romance anime, no big action sequences anywhere in sight, so the most epic thing you'll find are some speeches, a character suddenly bursting into a room, or something like a chess move or a sudden display of cooking, and every single time something like this happens they use this song, even at the tiniest instance, thereby immensly overplaying the grandness of what is happening. And they did it again and again and again, so as a result I came to really hate this piece of music, and since it's playing in the anime all the time, I now can't stand the anime either!
>> ARTICLE
1. I take it you don't like shoujo romance then? This is pretty much par for the course. It's the equivalent sexual fantasy for girls that something like Highschool DxD is for guys. It's very rare to find a male lead like in Ore Monogatari in the shoujo genre.

2. Yup she's a tsundere stereotype, if you don't like it I can understand why it's not for you. As far as the background characters they are not important at all. They are there purely for atmosphere and to demonstrate how various characters act relative to "random student A." That way we understand their personality and social standing.

3. Personal preference again, I really liked it.

I sound like I love this anime, but I actually just think it's above average. It's probably an 7 or 8.

Eh, Nisekoi is hardly a 'romance' though I guess you could call it one based on technicality alone. It's really a comedy with romance as the motivation for the comedy.

If you liked Golden Time, I would suggest watching White Album 2, Toradora!, or Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.

I have three words for you...

Kimi ni Todoke

To me, this is romance anime done right. Best Girl Kuronuma and Best Guy Kazehaya team up to form the Best Couple Of Them All, eventually, and damn few anime relationships have even come close. (Clannad/AS was one of them, though.) The two main characters are such polar opposites in public: the calm and confident Shouta versus the nervous and awkward shadow of Sawako. Yet amongst friends, Sawako is an amazing and incredible person that I could not help but to cheer for.

And the side characters were just as amazing. Best Friends Ayane and Chizuru were simply incredible at helping pry Sawako out of her shell and gently prod her into being much more sociable and confident. Ryuu was simply awesome and a great wingman for Shouta as well. And we could always depend on Pin for comedic relief when it really counted.

I laughed. I cried. I had flashbacks to being the person that everyone avoided back in school. And, most importantly, I fell in love with the entire anime. From the first OP to the last ED, I was entranced throughout. And even five years later and hundreds of romance titles gone by, it is still Kimi ni Todoke that holds my top spot.

I haven't watched too much romance anime but out of the ones I have, I'd have to give it to Arakawa Under the Bridge. It's not my favorite but it is one of the best I've seen simply because it's endearing and has somewhat of a development. It's not just "oh I like senpai but will he ever notice my feelings" or "depressing love triangle". It starts off as an actual relationship and though the anime explores the side characters more, you do get to see Rec and Nino interact and explore and blossom. And that's why it's so special to me. My favorite is Ouran High School Host Club but I consider it more comedy than romance.

Well OP asked for the "best romance anime". Your own favorite may not necessarily be the best and depending on how you define "romance" you may answer differently. 

Also shounen-romance generally tends to have a stronger comedy part, while shojo-romance tends to have a stronger romance part.
So if we wanted to know about the best "romance" it's not a bad question to ask "for boys or for girls".

Same here!  I thought it was just going to be a cutesy shoujo anime, but I am very pleasantly (or unpleasant might be a closer emotion) surprised.

I honestly still don't understand how anyone could have at any point ever believed this about Madoka. I read the description for it on several sites before watching it and the gist was "magical girls but dark"

Because I *didn't* read descriptions for it on several sites beore watching it.  My first encounter with it was the Weiss Schwartz card game...

English or Japanese because Madoka in english is fairly new.

I just bought both the Fate/Zero and Madoka packs, and uh, why I bought them, I have no idea. No idea how to play the card game, and of course, nobody to play it with. Still, they're physical objects with pictures of anime on them, so it's all good!
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first ep when it first aired, I had read no previews, I never pay attention to director/creator. Each season I simply download and watch the first ep or two of each series and then keep or drop them. After the first ep I thought it was just another mahou shoujo anime with no redeeming qualities, it was not until a few weeks later that I started seeing everyone talking about it that I gave it another chance to see what all the fuss was about.
>> ARTICLE
This sounds like exactly what happened to me.  I saw all the headlines on anime sites about Madoka after a couple weeks of it airing.  Instead of reading up on it I just decided to download the 3 episodes that had already aired and see for myself.  I stand by that decision. 
>> ARTICLE
It was kept secret that the show would be dark - on purpose - before release. If you didn't watch it when it first aired though, you are gonna be spoiled.

Also, people that know Gen knew he would go dark to an extent, but not everyone was familiar with him at that stage.
>> ARTICLE
I might be remembering it incorrectly, but I thought there were plenty of indicators in the first episode that it would be dark. Even then though, the sites I read didn't spoil it that badly. It was basically "Madoka and friends get into more than they bargained for" and I kind of assumed they'd have to become contract killers or something, which is actually kind of darker than it turned out. The [big moment](/s "in episode 3 everyone refers to as the turning point of the anime was still kind of "meh" to me because I assumed there'd be a deus ex ending. There kind of was.")

You're probably right though. I must have had more information going into it than the people who watched it as it aired. I just can't imagine anyone being surprised even with the minimal amount of info I had. Let alone the people who watch it now [knowing](/s "episode 3 is where everything starts to pick up.")

In relationship to OP's question though, I had the opposite effect with Madoka. I went into it expecting to love it, but it got progressively less enjoyable with every episode (except for Homura's episode, I really liked that). Ended up waiting until the ending for it to get better, but it didn't deliver imo. I understand my tastes are different than others and my opinion is in the minority though.
>> ARTICLE
Well the first episode is not all rainbows and sunshine. Kyubei is injured and there's a face-off with Mami and Homura.

Episodes 1 and 2 are largely focused on how nice Madoka's life is though. Her family loves her and her school life is enjoyable.  She even has great friends.

This is juxtaposed with Mami's life, which has many burdens, although it appears much more fun that it really is from the outside looking in.

When they go into the building with a witch for the first time, there is literally a quote from Faust (a story where a man make a deal with the devil) on the wall, so there is some foreshadowing to be sure, but I doubt many people expected the events of episode 3 to be so intense.

I was initially expecting her to eventually give in and become the sailor-moon of a 5-girl team. Instead I got a much more interesting, darker story about how good intentions often lead to horrible outcomes.

I actually just finished this, and [the ending](/s "really pissed me off, how incomplete it was. I need to get to reading the light novels, because the story was really good but the anime's ending sucked the D, imo.")
>> ARTICLE
I agree with OP on this, it's my favorite anime by far, but shit man. [You're right.] (/s "The ending SUCKED. I searched and searched, assuming there was another season because it was so bad.")
>> ARTICLE
well...the novels are 17 volumes....2 seasons of anime covered only 4 of them....so I guess if you want to know the ending, resorting to the novels is the only way to go...
>> ARTICLE
shiiiiiiiit. So much reading... but I guess it'll be worth it.
>> ARTICLE
yeah....I was looking into it too...I believe, that volumes 1-6 are already translated to English and legally available, but as far as 7-17 go, you have to look into more shady regions of internet for fan-translations....I think, that last time I checked, they were working on translation of vol.10 or so...
>> ARTICLE
Niiice. I might go check it out. Currently watching Tari Tari, Kokoro Connect and Sword Art Online.
>> ARTICLE
Loving Kokoro Connect already and I'm behind on it (I watch in sync with a group, so we end up two or three weeks behind inevitably). Just saw episode 4. I need to prod our downloader about SAO, I've not seen a copy of it, and yet she's stockpiling a load of other shows we haven't been watching, like the Autumn and Winter seasons aren't going to be bloody amazing...
>> ARTICLE
Ok... I checked that for you....anime season 1 is adaptation of volumes 1 and 2, and anime season 2 is adaptation of volumes 3 and 5. Translation of volume 10 is done and it is beeing worked on volume 11 right now. So if you want to pick up with novels, you start with volumes 4,6,7,8,9,10...and then you have to wait for it to be translated. Frequency of official translated releases is the same as was the original Japanese versions and that is one every half a year (with vol.6 beeing the latest english), so I guess fan-slation is the way to go.
>> ARTICLE
Sweet, thanks a lot!
>> ARTICLE
Watching all of those right now too! Gotta say Sword Art Online and Kokoro Connect are my favorites this summer. I also started reading the SAO novels, and man they're great.
>> ARTICLE
I really want to read the Kokoro Connect novels after seeing what a great job they did at animating (what I'm presuming is) the first volume.

Are there translations anywhere?
>> ARTICLE
You could try baka-tsuki.org That's where I find the SAO translations.
>> ARTICLE
Agree completely. I didn't expect it to be... so good. Once I started the series I couldn't stop watching. 
>> ARTICLE
It might sound odd, but [Crest of the Stars](http://myanimelist.net/anime/290/Seikai_no_Monshou) gives off a very similar vibe.  Not economics, and it has a wildly different setting, but Lafiel and Jinto are incredibly similar to Holo and Lawrence.  If that was your favorite part of the show I highly recommend it.

[Gosick](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8425/Gosick) is very similar in that regard as well, and takes place in a similar setting.
>> ARTICLE
Crest of the stars. FUCK YEAH!
Also has anyone been able to find something akin to it?

Edit: Forgot a question.

Watched Gosick last week, I would also recommend this series.

.............Lucky Star.....................
>> ARTICLE
At first I really didn't like it, but all the references really won me over after a while.  I think the tipping point was the [initial D parody.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYPZum8Pxvc)
>> ARTICLE
Lucky Star got so much better after the first few episodes. Changing the director really made a world of difference.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that explains why it felt so different after the fourth episode. I was ready to drop the series after episode 2 (like I did with Madoka [which I need to get back to]). Lucky Channel was what kept me watching, and I'm glad it did.
>> ARTICLE
Ya, when I'm trying to show someone Lucky Star I always show them later episodes. The 10 minutes talking about cornets, while cute if you already know the characters, does not help to convince people to watch the show.

>like I did with Madoka

Oh god, seriously? I'm sure you know this by now seeing all the praise Madoka gets on here, but keep going! I already knew I'd love Madoka because of the art style (I love Shaft and heard it described as "girls attacked by the Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei openings"), but for everyone I recommended it to I made them promise me they'd watch through episode three. Every single one has finished the whole series and thought it was great.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching it right now. For some reason I thought it was super amazing when I hadn't seen other anime, but every time I rewatch it to look for more references I can get, it just seems more boring...
>> ARTICLE
i watched lucky star almost 4 years ago. i wasn't an anime person back then and i still wouldnt become someone who loves anime until a few months ago. i just watched it back then because my friends said you couldn't stand watching more than like 3 episodes. 


..............i watched the whole thing in like 2 days.

they also told me to watch boku no pico..........

thank the lord/myself i did some research first


>> ARTICLE
I have never been so entertained by Coronets before in my life.

Elfen Lied. At first it just seemed to be about some dude who lived with three girls but was clueless as to how to take advantage of such a situation, but then I really got into it. Great themes on what it means to be human, deep stuff like that. In that regard, it is thematically similar to Darker Than Black, which I absolutely loved.
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree!

K-on.

I just recently finished season 2, and let me tell you, some tears were shed.

I did not expect this at all.

Cute girls doing cute things taken to a whole new level.

There is a season 2!!! Well there goes my next two days off! How did I miss this?

You my friend, are in for a world of joy.

i was surprised myself. I cant wait til the english dub for season 2 comes out so i can watch it
>> ARTICLE
yeah same here. never expected to like it at all.

at first i was hoping it would be like Beck where there is a good focus in music. it was not and surprisingly, i didnt mind.

i think it will be the only moe anime i will ever watch.

Oreimo.
>> ARTICLE
When Oreimo first came out, I actually dropped it.  I picked it up again a year later and it is easily one of my favorites.  Don't know what I was thinking.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK. I cried my fucking eyes out and laughed my ass off. Seriously a great anime that's brutally honest.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely *hated* that there was no kiss at all in the series.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the whole show, every second of it, but not having that kiss completely ruined it for me. I still love the show, but it would have been even better if it had a certain kiss! 
>> ARTICLE
I fucking know. But I also respect the anime for not doing that. I mean they kinda completely cut off fan service and made everyone look pathetic. They made romance kind of a twisted thing that is anything other than cliche and it was a nice change. 
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Welcome to the NHK the other day, for some reason I can't get over how depressing the mood was during some parts. I can't stop thinking about [Welcome to the NHK spoiler](/s "the note that said the New Years yams were delicious.") It hurts so much to think about it, amazing anime though.
>> ARTICLE
Page not found.. What spoiler were you referring to? But yes the depressing mood made me depressed as well. I could not stop crying it's ridiculous. Made me think about the anime series Kanon. Oh man that one was also just a roller coaster of sad for me. Have you seen it?
>> ARTICLE
Finished it a few hours ago, I honestly feel really depressed. An anime has never influenced me the way this one has. Usually it's a matter of "Too bad that it's over", but now it's not only that, but also the contents of the anime and the ending. Oh my god I feel like shit. Misaki and Satou were both characters I cared about as soon as I was introduced to them in the series. The struggle they had, and the lack of communication between them frustrated me to no end. 

I feel kind of bad for being this influenced by a (great) piece of media.
>> ARTICLE
I am not a huge fan of mechas so when i was recommended Gurren Lagann I was very skeptical but it turned out to be a fantastic and moving series
>> ARTICLE
Finished this last night actually. Think I watched the full series in 3 day or so. At first I was like wtf? Then I was like well this is kind of cool and interesting. Too why the hell have I never watched this before? 

Dang, thanks reddit! 
>> ARTICLE
I've only shed tears for 2 animes, and that is one of them. Fma/brotherhood would be the other...
>> ARTICLE
How over the top it was is what made it so charming.
>> ARTICLE
My personal favorite series.  How did you cope with the ever increasing magnitude of kicking reason to said curb?
>> ARTICLE
Clannad (anime) wasn't really a harem though. Yeah the other girls liked the MC, but they never stood a chance. It wasn't him having a bunch of sexual confusion between all of the girls. The MC and the main girl (MG) were the only ones who were ever going to get together in the end. The show is about family and friendship.

[Clannad:After Story Spoiler] (/s "Nagisa and Okazaki were the only ones who were ever going to get together. You can tell this in the first season when Nagisa gets hit by the ball and he wouldn't let anyone near her. That was when all of the other girls sort of got it, that she was the only one he loved in the first place. The other girls were never on his radar except for him to help them because that is what friends and family are for. The show is about friendship and family first and foremost.  It has a lot of the tropes of harems but doesn't really go into them, it is almost pointing them out as a joke. Okazaki helps the girls because they are a family, and he is a good guy. He also collects the happiness, the orbs of light, to eventually wish for Nagisa and Ushio to live. That is essentially his reward.")

The VN might have been different though, I didn't play it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but I didn't know that when I started watching it. I really want the VN now though.
>> ARTICLE
If you need help setting up, ask. It's hard to get running. Took me about 5 hours... And most comp problems only take me 1-2, so I'm guessing the average person will get lost :P
>> ARTICLE
What problems.... took me less than 5 minutes if we're talking about the VN.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. You're a sonuvva bitch. It didn't work for me. The game would load, but any time I clicked an option in the main menu, it would crash. I tried getting a different version, different translation patch, etc. And eventually I found out my comp needed to be in Japanese region mode.
>> ARTICLE
>And eventually I found out my comp needed to be in Japanese region mode.

I must be some magical wizard reading some weird ass symbols (Not Japanese) because I've never had to do that. Sure, its confusing as fuck and took me 30 minutes, but for some reason it wont let me install Eastern Asian Languages on my computer without a disk ._.
>> ARTICLE
Fortunately, the instructions on vndb tell you to do exactly that prior to installation.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't see that :P
>> ARTICLE
Also because First Girl is First.
>> ARTICLE
The VN sorta also focused on Nagisa, but you can make it so that Tomoya leans towards other girls a lot more than her. Remember when he sees her eating alone in like the first episode and goes to her? You can choose to not do that.
>> ARTICLE
Ya, the VN has frequent choices for Nagisa... I felt bad every time I neglected her... Q_Q
>> ARTICLE
Yeah jun madea wrote her path so the intent was always to follow her as the "lead heroine".

I did feel kidna bad for it, but I'll be honest her pre-AS route is boring, I went with kitomi first. but playing the AS route is what really makes her character.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass.....
I swear to myself that I will give any anime a try. Knowing that Code Geass can count as part of the mecha anime genre, I expected not to really like it. Now, it is in my top 3 series of all time. I have re-watched the entire series 5 times.
>> ARTICLE
First time I could only watch the first episode and then I dropped it. Came back to it half a year later and I watched all of it in a week or so. Became one of my favorites, considering watching again.

5 times dude, holy cow. I remember the first time i watched it was like, holy cow this is so good and it never ends. . . .A W E S O M E

Ano Natsu - I hate aliens and random scifi stuff shoved into otherwise normal romance anime. I also tend not to like love circles as big as the one here. However, it really got to me. A while after watching it, I forgot why I liked it in the first place and thought it hadn't been great, but then I watched it again and it was just as amazing. Still can't figure out what it is I like about it.

Ano Hana and 5 Centimeters per Second. 
Did not expect it to be what it is at all.

Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt.

I read about it and didn't get around to watching it until recently. I've watched every episode now,including the OVA. I now want a second season.

I never expected I'd get used to the art style, and I expected not to like the characters, from what TVTropes told me.

But I did. There's this brand, this mix of crazy awesome, pop culture and shameless fanservice that defines this show,and which I found quite enjoyable. It's not perfect, but I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
Did you watch it subbed or the dub?
>> ARTICLE
I watched both--sub all the way. The dub was...okay. It wasn't as horrible as some others I've watched and the swearing was on par with Black Lagoon's dub, but while the voices were somewhat annoying sometimes I can tell they at least tried to suit the character (Panty's valley-girl speech. Ergh.)
>> ARTICLE
Same here, the first time I saw it was in anime club. My reaction consisted of, "the fuck did I just watch?!" I ended up watching it later, and now I love it.
>> ARTICLE
What really surprised me about this show was how invested I was by the end of it. [When Panty and Brief](/s "saw each other at the party near the end and CHOCOLAT played, I was really surprised that the show had an emotional scene like that and that it actually made me feel something.") Amazing series.

Edit: Remembered the scene wrong but here [it is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RprSeqWwUM&feature=related)
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if you are old enough to have seen it, but [that scene is directly taken from an American film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOjuzvLcsos) They even kept the exact same song. 

This reference made me extremely happy, and brought back some memories from my teenage years. 

The show has so many amazing references to American culture, especially 90's and earlier 2000's stuff. I really love all the little touches.

>> ARTICLE
That surprised me too! I was watching for the craziness and how over-the-top ridiculous it was.

I wish it gets a season two--truly unique and enjoyable series. I fell head over heels for Scanty, especially. I'd like to see more of her.

Cross game. don't really like sports anime but this made me re-think a bit about the genre.

Nichijou - i looked at the little thumbnail on crunchyroll and said "fuck it, i have nothing to do atm".... laughs were had, i waited like half an hour till crunchy updated it when it was airing, fucking loved it, the ops and eds

Kore wa zombie desu ka - anything related to this show looked so dumb to me, i watched the first episode and loved everything, i fucking love the ed

Planetes - it looked liked one of those old timey animes that would be good, not old, not good..... it was the most amazing amazing brain fucks

Off the OP, i only watched Shuffle! because i didn't know good anime (i youtubed it, i still can't believe i watched such low quality stuff), actually back then i loved it, but now i can't see why.... clannad i expected manly tears and got manly sobbing

K-ON!

Simply because I thought years ago that I'd never like boring anime that had no supernatural stuff, or action. But over the years apparently even the cutesy slice of life stuff captivates me.

Weird to see how broad my tastes have grown as I've aged.

I don't think I've ever doubted a friend's recommendation on an anime enough to start watching one with negative feelings toward it.

In the end, I found it really enjoyable.

Let's see Clannad, Death Note, Dog Days, Great Teacher Onizuka, and Toradora are all I can think of. 

I thought Clannad was going to be just another harem romance thingy. 

Death Note sounded stupid to me. This was back when I was 13 or so, stuff like this really interests me these days.

Dog Days sounded like Zero no Tsukaima, which I didn't like. In fact, I watched it because I wanted to torment myself with something bad.

Great Teacher Onizuka was I don't know, I just didn't think I'd like it too much.

Toradora sounded like one of the super typical romance with the super-mega-tsundere that I would want to punch in the boobs.

I used to hate shoujo stuff until I watched K-ON! (I was reading a lot of shoujo manga but didn't know they were shoujo because they were romance) but now I feel like every shoujo is cool an enjoyable. (I'm a guy btw)

Fruit Basket

At first it looked really girly with no plot but then I read on (I read the manga, sorry if it's a little off topic) and it became one of my favorite series. Tears were shed at the end. 'Tis was the first time I cried at the end of a series.

Ouran High School Host Club.

I'm not a huge fan of the harem type of animes, much less a male harem type show, but it was fantastic all the way around.

Hilarious show with a decent depth of character. Ends kind of clicheish, but still worthy of a watch. I watched in Netflix and it was dubbed, but they did a really good job of it.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the animated series, which I found to be OK, but the manga is far superior. Tamaki is not nearly as stupid as the animation makes him out to be (he's still clueless and eccentric, though). I felt the ending in the anime was not fitting, and when I read the manga I was not surprised to see that funimation had made up the ending (not in the manga). 

If you liked the anime I highly recommend the manga- it's funnier, addresses gender issues more directly, and has a nice resolution. Only 18 volumes, too, so it's not an epic length series.
>> ARTICLE
I know it's pretty much a default to say "Manga is better" but Canadian Anarchist is right in this case. In the interest of brevity, the anime *had* to omit some of the interesting character development aspects from the manga. 

I won't go in to details because of spoilers, but it's similar to Kuragehime in that the characterizations are what really *make* the series and a manga can give more time to developing them than an anime can.

After reading a ton of hate for Guilty Crown, I was expecting it to be just terrible. It wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'll stand with ya Bro.  I didn't hate Guilty Crown either.  Sure it wasn't the best anime but since I went in with little expectations I was presently surprised.  Sure there were some plot holes but nothing that I wasn't used to in generic anime.  The animation was beautiful and the soundtrack was fantastic.  It was my lazy watch and I enjoyed it for what it was. 
>> ARTICLE
i just finished guilty crown. it was filled with inconsistant errors with the main plot. like when he took out the voids sometimes they would faint and sometimes they wouldnt. the whole story was cliche but it was very enjoyable. the art is amazing the music was quite nice
>> ARTICLE
I think it depended on the hand he used for taking their void out. one would take the void out for his use and the other would make it so that they could use it themselves.
>> ARTICLE
The production values were really high, and the staff that was announced (a combo of the Death Note and Code Geass staff) caused many of us to get insanely excited. 

We all expected alot going in, and in my opinion, it just turned out to be really nothing special in most respects. I think the action and love-story are both totally bland in particular. For a show with such a great pedigree, it needed to be better than average to impress us, and in these aspects it just wasn't. However, those 2 elements weren't the reason people have a hatred for this series.

The major problems with GC relate to the writing. It has been said a billion times, but they just threw in so many big themes without sewing them together in an emotionally powerful way. Compare Guilty Crown to Code Geass, for example, and you just get this enormous contrast in almost every way. 

For example, they started off with a hint that we'd have some level of moral ambiguity around Undertaker. This is great, since they're terrorists and all, but with super-corny arch-villains in the GHQ we can't help but see Undertaker as heroic. Compare that to LeLouche's development.

Part one is kind of a watered-down story about a Japanese terrorist group challenging the imperialism of the GHQ. Part two is about explaining what happened on Lost Christmas, and I was very eager for this part. Let's just say I really hated the direction they took with all the amnesia and people having split personalities. That's just the lamest possible way they could have gone in my opinion.

Then we have the characters. Inori starts off a bit mysterious, and I really liked the episode where they suggested she was only pretending to like Shu under orders from Gai, but she quickly transforms from a pretty cool heroine into Orihime from Bleach. She's just there to repeat "Shu" in a seductive little whisper, over and over again, much like Orihime shouts "kurosaki-kun!" in every fight he ever has. 

GC also doesn't really do a good job with Shu. He's worthless 99% of the time, and then when he DOES want to do something good he becomes a flawless warrior, despite having almost no training. It actually pisses me off how good he does, since he needs zero support, no one can seem to shoot him accurately, and he doesn't use any real strategy. 

In Geass, the mech units were really dangerous, even for Zero, but in GC they just melt like butter when they touch a powerful void. Even when some of Shu's friends are poised to have a big fight, he ends up just butting in and 1-shotting whatever they were squaring off against. Ugh... the mech battles in this particular series are just so bland, most of the time they are actually just arm-wrestling. Where are the bad-ass custome Knightmare suits with deadly weapons of their own?

The most memorable part of the action was the cool CGI effect around Inori's sword, while the battles themselves lacked anything in the way of complexity or creative choreography. Most of the kills in this series can be described simply by the the sentence, "Shu slices the bad guy's mech in half, in slow motion, and then jumps away before it explodes."

As for the love story, it's one of those "girl  thrown at the main character" situations. Instead of really showing how Inori falls in love with Shu, she just sort of switches from being distant and mysterious to pathetic and tragic. 

Later we get the huge revelation from Inori's and Shu's past, which just made it feel so unbelievably cliche - and creepy to an extent if you consider their former status (don't wanna have to use spoilers her).

In all the other respects, it just felt like a train-wreck. It's hard to take the action seriously when there is a cat-girl using her butt to push a giant button while "hacking" into the enemy computers with her bizarre hologram chamber. Also, somehow this requires her to wear skin-tight plug suits.

In the end, most of us were just mad that they didn't do another re-write. I didn't have anything against the show going into it, I wanted it to be good. Instead I just felt like they wasted alot of money, and didn't tell a very unique story. Most likely, the creators couldn't get on the same page creatively. The story shifts around alot, chasing one big theme for 2 episodes and then doing a hair-pin turn.

Ultimately, GC just shows us things we've seen before, done better elsewhere, and it just doesn't have a message. I think if they improved anything - even just the love story or mech fights, I would rate it as a mild success, but it's just such a mess.

Oh, and please don't get me started on the school episodes, nearly all of them are painfully bad.
>> ARTICLE
TL;DR It's a lesser version of Eureka 7/Code Geas.
>> ARTICLE
This is mostly accurate. The mech units in E7 are really bad-ass. I mean... they're freaking surfers that kill people mid-air.

The action and love story really work in E7. I can't say the same for GC. 


>> ARTICLE
> It's hard to take the action seriously when there is a cat-girl using her butt to push a giant button while "hacking" into the enemy computers with her bizarre hologram chamber. Also, somehow this requires her to wear skin-tight plug suits.

And don't forget the sensual moaning and blushing of the mech pilot girl, when her machine gets a serious hit.

The only anime I've expected to not enjoy was Bakemonogatari. I had heard things about the amount of fanservice, I watched the first episode and everything went over my head, and I didn't like the slideshow junk at all.

Came back over two years later to watch the whole lot of it, really liked it. Definitely needed to be more in tune with Japanese culture I guess.

Soul Eater. When I first watched it it seemed too cartoonish for me. After watching more and more I started to enjoy it since I started to see the things that I recognized personally. The show is now a favorite of mine along with Elfen Lied and Rosario + Vampire.

I absolutely am very anal about the art of the anime I watch; it should be very... visual, I should say. But DMC's art was hideous. But nevertheless, I enjoyed it thoroughly.

I didn't think that I would enjoy TTGL. I've never really enjoyed mecha, so I was kinda not wanting to watch. I pushed myself to because of much hype it had and a really good review I read. I was completely taken back by how awesome it was.

Gintama.

i was still watching normal shounens back then mainly the Big 3. Had to drop Naruto because of all its filler arcs and Bleach because the series itself went bad really fast in my opinion.
When i was finally able to catch up on One Piece, i started to look for alternatives to fill the gap between episodes.

Started watching Reborn. Liked it at first but after 90 episodes, i didnt want to watch anymore. i dunno why.

Then i saw Gintama. My initial reactions was like "oh man. i am not going to like this", "wth those aliens are drawn so bad!", "so he uses a wooden sword.... LAME!".

Even with those things annoying me, i kept on watching, i kept on laughing, and in some way always impressed by every episode.

The series is full of fillers but i dont really mind at all as almost all of them are great. Also, theres barely any story going on to begin with. :))

People say that Gintama breaks the 4th wall all the time. Im not sure what that means but i completely agree coz it sounds awesome.

This is a must watch for those Shounen lovers that want something different.

For me, the only preview for Gintama I had was the description on crunchyroll, and it really didn't sell the show too well. "Gintama is a story of a handyman named Gintoki, a samurai with no respect for rules set by the invaders, who's ready to take any job to survive." I finally watched it, and just a few episodes in, I was hooked. Gintama is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise.

Breaking the fourth wall means you're doing or saying something that acknowledges that you are indeed a cartoon, or fake or what have you. I remember a scene where Gin turns into one of Ichigos forms at the end of the episode because he thinks it's cool. That's breakinig the fourth wall. Or look up Deadpool and all the crazy shit he does to break the 4th wall. Hilarity

The reason is because I thought it would be random parody without a plot. Boy was I wrong. The story was much deeper than I thought I thought it would be. It really made me really think about what hard work could ascertain.

Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. When it first came I was pretty skeptical to the first episodes but then it really grew onto me.

Me too. When I first heard about it and read the synopsis, I was pretty skeptical, especially since it was my first anime. I'm so glad that I did go ahead and watch it though.

K-on. Went in thinking I wouldn't like it. Two days later I finished the first season wanting more. 
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats. I don't know why, I always got the vibe that it was more girly and bad drama. But it was GREAT drama and character development and humor and even some decent action. Great series.
>> ARTICLE
I had a similar reaction. I expected it to be another forgettable school-life harem and really only started it as a timewaster while waiting for something a little more toothy to come along. 

Instead, it was one of the most well-rounded stories I've come across to date. 
>> ARTICLE
I was uncertain of Angel Beats at first glance, turned out to be my favorite anime of all time.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I finally caved in yesterday and started watching it. I don't want it to end!
>> ARTICLE
Chaos;Head. Sure it's got issues, but overall I found it really fun to watch, especially how the main character reacts to the events around him. I don't think it would get as much hate as it does if Steins;Gate wasn't so excellent.
>> ARTICLE
I watched this simply because I thought it was relevant to Steins;Gate in some way.  Sigh... could have saved myself the time
>> ARTICLE
I went into the series knowing the hate it got, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was not the greatest anime I've ever seen, but it certainly was not awful. Rushed or not, for people who had not seen the VN, it was OK.
>> ARTICLE
The anime is considered bad because the VN outshines the adaptation. It got forced into 12 episodes and was really rushed.
>> ARTICLE
If it had been given the 24 episodes i would argue it could have rivalled Steins;Gate, I pray they won't make the mistake of giving them a half season for their games again(I believe Robotics;Notes got a full season).

clannad was ok to me.  After story sealed the deal, i loved that show so much, and i cried it touched so many emotions I thought I lost.  Greatest show of all time.

K-ON! I didn't expect it to be so interesting! I saw descriptions saying 'it's about cute girls doing cute things' and thought it was going to be a show full of nothingness. Little did I know the songs were really awesome and it was super funny. I still need to finish season 2 but I just don't want it to end ;-;

Steins;Gate. I watched the first episode and I was like, 'this is confusing as fuck'. Then I continued watching it (I have a 'five-episode' rule where if it still is boring/confusing/whatever five episodes in then I drop it) and I loooveeed it so much. Such an amazing show! Seriously, I found my favorite [character](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bf0aYBk0OQ) *and* tsundere in one show!

Honestly, Cat Planet Cuties (Asobi ni Iku Yo!).

Going in, I thought you couldn't possibly get more stereotypical and generic than cat-girls in plugsuits. I expected to enjoy it in a "I'm going to mock this for a few episodes and then get bored" kind of way.

Instead, it was self-referential humor that parodied of a lot of harem tropes, with engaging characters and a cute story line. It knew what it was trying to be and it did it well. Plus, the animation in it was pretty well done. 

edit: phrasing.

Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica definitively because I know it was good, but  i was already half way through one piece when it came out and waited until I caught up before watching it, and man the first episode just blew me away completely and loved it all the way through definitively one of my top 3 anime I have ever watched, given I have only watched some 25 anime.

For me it was Durarara, I just didn't expect to like it so much let alone get all worked up about wether or not there's gonna be a second season.

Anything made after about 2004.

>> ARTICLE
I see this "anime has gone to hell" idea a lot, but as someone who only got into it recently I feel the opposite - the animation on recent anime just seems so much better that I can't stand the older stuff. 
>> ARTICLE
I just see "pans" instead of actual animation. I'm infuriated by low cell counts; basically I'm only sticking around for Noitamina shows.
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty common thing. I know people who have read a few manga and watched a few anime, but if I try recommending older stuff they can't get into it because of the artstyle. 

Animation wise, you can definitely see a lot of series are getting more moeblob-ish. Whether that's bad or not is up to you.
>> ARTICLE
That's not really my issue with most of the animation on the whole; it's not the "style" but how that style manifests itself and works in a gestalt sense. I also lean heavy on story; a good story means I'll stick around, regardless. Looking at you, blatant "we're going broke!" offenders.

I liked FMA a lot (the original), but man... THAT is some cheap animation, just a constant parade of background pans and scans that will do anything to avoid a cell count which might involve actually paying an animator to draw stuff that moves.

To be fair, I've really enjoyed Stein's;Gate (went from 'heh' to 'WHOA!'), Durarara!!, Princess Jellyfish, and some other random shows. Hell, I'll even cop to digging Oreimo and Haruhi. I also like the Eva rebuild films a lot.
>> ARTICLE
You'd probably hate anything made before 2004 as well, you just haven't bothered with the bad stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I just work at an anime company and have followed it for 25 years and moved to Japan to work in Akihabara and have done master's level research on it; I obviously have absolutely *no idea* what I'm talking about.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Sounds like you don't. (I got the sarcasm, you're just stupid that's all)
>> ARTICLE
I like to think I have an open mind.  So hit me, why are recent anime bad, and what is it about older anime that makes it better?

Edit: That being said, maybe you were referring to personal taste rather than actual quality, in that case I misunderstood the post and I will take back what I said.  Otherwise, let's carry on.
>> ARTICLE
Sure! I'm openly copping to being a dick up there; rough day, long one, bummed out, etc. 

I named a few here: http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/xv5lf/what_anime_did_you_not_expect_to_like/c5pvw4o . I also liked Hell Girl, enjoyed Golgo 13 for what it was, and was surprised as hell to find myself liking Lucky Star (despite some episodes not really connecting). Most recently I've been into Jormungand and KoTS. Cross Game was also massively underrated, but sports shows do pretty poorly here. Alas...

Anyway: on the whole, an expanding market in terms of the number of productions combined with shrinking budgets for the same productions means you often end up with inferior animation in the technical sense. There's just an EXPLOSION of shows out there, and when people can't pay animators the corners get cut. It's kind of a bummer, ESPECIALLY if you like awesome-looking animation. Hence Redline being a real treat. 

Story-wise, I really think there's a lot of scripting issues that have side-tracked / impacted animation as a medium in a negative way. You kind of see the same stories over and over again ("Cool! Just like *Fushigi Yugi*. Again...") in a lot of art forms, but the sheer Database Animals side of it makes it a bit too predictable. 

I also found that as I move into greybeard territory there's less and less stuff that's being animated that appeals to older cats; this means that *seinen* shows are fewer and far between. I find myself reading manga more and more these days, although Noitamina is still an exciting proposition. Say what you will about Dragonball or Fist of The North Star; they're repetitive, don't have amazing budgets, and were often damned-near-intentionally bad, but they were fun and practically anybody could watch them. I miss that universality.

TL;DR: A lot of recent animation is superficially pretty (neat colors, backgrounds) but suffers from un-even scripting and often weakened animation. A glut of shows also pushes the hit / shit ratio way down, and can be a huge turn-off for potential fans. It's mostly a numbers game; 2-3 shows a season are solid, but when you have 30-50 a season it nukes the batting average.
>> ARTICLE
Animation:

I tend to feel the same way with the way the newer series are animated, but at the same time, the elements that you and I deem "superficial" are still things that can be considered important to some people.  Man-hours put into the animation aside, I feel there is nothing intrinsically more valuable in fluid motion over the new possibilities made by better technology, such as gradients, higher resolutions, neat colors, etc.  Of course, we know those are really simple and easy things, so in the grand scheme of things, they aren't as **impressive**, but it's hard for me to say that the animation in older series is objectively **better** as a group than newer series when solely looking at the results.  Sure, the newer shows are spending less resources, resulting in comparatively worse animation to other recent shows as well as worse motion, but it's different enough from old styles with different enough properties that I'm willing to say it's not objectively worse.  Of course, none of this matters when talking about things we like, just something I wanted to bring up, because besides what I was just talking about, the really bad new stuff is basically crap in HD.


Stories:

Yeah, the whole moeblob explosion has indeed increased the predictability of what stories are going to be reused.  I wanted to make an argument here about how maybe the industry is moving faster, so the rate of ideas being reused has increased, giving us the perception of the anime industry being unoriginal...but then I remembered moeblobs.

Seinen:

Honest question - can you really say the **number** of seinen shows has decreased, as opposed to the **ratio** of seinen to non-seinen shows?  I predict this might be a "yes" due to the amount of polarization and market niches in the anime industry lately, but I thought this might still be worth asking.


**TLDR**: Yeah, fuck moeblobs.
>> ARTICLE
/a/ has done the comparisons so many times.  The rate of good shows has remained constant since the 80's, there's just a lot more bad shows now.

EDIT:  I mean without even trying, Honey and Clover, Tatami Galaxy, TTGL, Madoka, Kaiji, Kara no Kyoukai, Redline, Katanagatari, Trapeze, Steins;Gate are all made post 2004.

I don't know if I've said it before, but Ushio is *really* adorable.  I've said it repeatedly already? Well, it needed to be said again.

Kyou being Ushio's teacher is predictable but pleasing. Really glad to see her again (she is best girl after all) and knowing she's been looking after Ushio all this time. We saw Ushio drawing Botan the previous episode, she's grown huge.

The scenes with Fuko really bring back that classic Clannad comedy, it's very nice.

Tomoya's father-daughter scenes with Ushio are just a joy to watch.

aaaaand then bad things start to happen again at the end. Oh well.

>> ARTICLE
Honestly I enjoyed it from the beginning (except that first episode) but early episodes are way weaker than the later ones. It is going to depend a lot on what you find funny naturally but here are some of the first season episodes I really enjoyed.

20, 25, 34+35, 43+44, 46, 48

I would recommend watching episode 25, then you could try any of those other ones, or you could skip to Season 2 which starts at episode 50. I think episodes 25 and 50 are super representative of what the humor is like, and are really very funny. 

If you are desperate for an actual serious arc and not just humor the first one starts at episode 58 and goes through 61. It is really good.

Also I think the series has a very particular type of humor that a lot of people just don't find funny. Most of my friends think Gintama sucks, so your mileage may very! I find dumb toilet humor and references funny so it works for me.
>> ARTICLE
Okay now that I got the gist behind endless 8.  My answer would be : Mirai Nikki's ending, like episode 20 or so.

>> ARTICLE
[FMA 2003 spoilers](/s "In FMA 2003, Tucker and Nina are already around for a while before it happens. They're introduced in episode 6, the alchemy exam episode. Ed and Al interact with Nina during that episode, Nina helps them through the exam phase. She's even there for Ed's birthday, which is the same day Elicia Hughes is born (which she goes through panicking along with Ed and Al, as well). Tucker seems like a pretty cool dude, but you don't really learn too much about him. Then in episode 7 he's reminded of the upcoming evaluation, and you see him slowly start to deteriorate throughout the episode. The build to the definitive scene is handled much better overall. There's a scene where Nina draws a picture to send to her mom who's allegedly living with her parents; Ed later finds the same drawing in an ash tray all burnt up, the implication being that Tucker tried to dispose of it. You get an eerie feeling that something isn't right throughout the episode. And then the actual scene itself is handled amazingly. The sense of dread is high going into it, the confrontation with Tucker is intense, and the dialogue (if you're watching the dub) is also infinitely better than Brotherhood's version of the scene. Going even beyond that, even Scar's mercy-kill of her is handled with a more emotional impact. In Brotherhood, it's just another life being taken. In 2003, it's his inception, his realization of what he must do.")

I didn't bother continuing Lucky Star because the first episode feels dull to me. I've gotten to the part where they talk about eating popsicle sticks. Should I continue further?

The first few episodes are pretty dull.  Then they fire the director and things get better.  Skip to episode 5 if you want.  

Or continue to slowly gnaw at the choco-cornet for a few more episodes.

No wonder it didn't feel that "funny" for something that was hyped as a funny anime. I'll probably give it a try again once I get on the right mood for it. Thanks!

The ending itself I personally didn't mind and for that episode alone, it was fine. It was just everything that built up to it didn't work and doesn't make sense for Kanaki since he spoke like less than 100 words the entire series

It's not necessarily that he lost (although I wish he won then and lost later), but the fact that it felt cheap. It was like "Oh you got tricked off screen. Rekt"

Maybe the setup was worse in the anime than the manga, but I always thought the solution, and how Light got outsmarted, was telegraphed pretty well from pretty far back. It's his own fault for getting drunk on his pride and underestimating Mello and Near.

>> ARTICLE
Too much denwa at once
>> ARTICLE
An infamous section of the second season of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The characters are stuck in a temporal loop for eight episodes, with the exact same events playing out over and over again with only minor variations.

Audience reaction to having 8/14 episodes of a highly-anticipated series be more or less identical was...mixed, to say the least.
>> ARTICLE
"Mixed". You would make a great diplomat.
>> ARTICLE
I still believe that Endless Eight is essential to understanding Disappearance. If 8 loops drove the audience nuts, imagine what almost 16000 would do to Nagato?
>> ARTICLE
They could have largely gotten the same message across in three or even two loops. I believe the light novel only did two loops.
>> ARTICLE
is that spoilers? because it sounds like it, i dont know anything about the show other than a close friend said i would really like it.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you just got spoiled that it looped for 8 episodes. That's not that important and as unbearable as you can just marathon the whole thing nowadays. Imagine Watching 8 weeks straight the same episode! And at the time it was airing, I guess most people didn't even know how long it would go on. 
>> ARTICLE
Minor spoilers, though not really that important.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say so. It's just the setting, not much else actually
>> ARTICLE
It's one of those things that is so central to the show's identity that I'm not sure it really counts as a spoiler any more. It's like saying "Lots of people die on Game of Thrones". *Any* recommendation or viewing guide on what order to watch the episodes in will warn viewers about Endless Eight. 

Even [the infographic on the /r/anime wiki](http://i.imgur.com/CMaAuPB.png) brings it up.

i wouldn't look up a viewing guide, i would just watch the show.

To watch the show you have to look up a viewing guide.

It's special that way.
>> ARTICLE
or i could just start at episode 1 like i would any other show.
>> ARTICLE
There are two different episode 1s though, that's the issue. 
>> ARTICLE
And an Episode 0
>> ARTICLE
Except episode 1 is different depending on if you watch it broadcast or on DVD.
>> ARTICLE
ok, that seems really strange, i think i would go with the broadcast order as thats how many people will have seen it, out of curiosity i checked my usual site and played the first episode, it started with a guy talking about not believing in santa, is it fine to just watch from there?

it just lists episode 1-28

*sigh* i just got started on fate and now i have another show with a confusing order
>> ARTICLE
The best way to watch it, IMO, is episode 1 broadcast order first (episode 0), then watch in Chronological order. The first episode does a really good job of showcasing what the series is like, but it's pretty confusing at first.
>> ARTICLE
> i would go with the broadcast order

>  it started with a guy talking about not believing in santa

That's Episode 2 in Broadcast Order ;)

It's Episode 1 in Chronological/DVD order, though, and it's perfectly fine to watch them that way, though people will say you lose impact of certain episodes that way.
>> ARTICLE
It really does make a big difference which order you watch it in IMO. I remember loving the hell out of trying to figure out exactly WTF was going on watching it week to week at it aired, but when it finally came out for DVD here, and i bought it, they had reordered all the episodes chronologically, and it didn't feel nearly the same. I think Crunchyroll has a queue option for it that plays it in original broadcast order. The first episode should be them making a movie according to broadcast order.

I don't intend to finish Haruhi any time soon (or ever) but can someone explain what this endless 8 is exactly? 

I assume it's some sort of infinite recursion, something like a time paradox where you go back in time and become your own father.

Is that it? 
>> ARTICLE
It's [](/s "a time loop that repeats 15,532 times. They show this by having 8 nearly identical episodes in a row. For those of you watching this at home in 2009 that's *2 whole months* of the same thing again and again.")
>> ARTICLE
The dumbest thing was the DVD sales - in Japan they do two episodes per DVD for like around $60 at the time, and all 4 of the endless eight DVDs sold over 100k counts...
>> ARTICLE
So basically [Steins;Gate](/s "Okabe repeatedly trying and failing to save Mayuri, except it happens more times? ") 

And people watched this stuff repeatedly over 2 months while it was airing... that's... hilar... ridiculous
>> ARTICLE
yup, except [its](/s " the same dialogue the same things happening, just redrawn from different angled and maybe paced differently")
>> ARTICLE
> And people watched this stuff repeatedly over 2 months while it was airing... that's... hilar... ridiculous

Many tables were flipped, let me tell you.  Those were dark days.
>> ARTICLE
Well, not quite, because it was literally the same thing 6/8 times. Well, minor variations in details, and everything was freshly animated and the lines re-recorded. We kept watching for about the first month because there was no way they would commit to this gag for more than a few episodes. For reference, Endless Eight is *one* chapter in the LN, the last loop. After that, anyone who was left likely kept watching it out of sheer stubbornness and spite. 

On the plus side, I could turn the subtitles off and still follow along by week 5, so it wasn't *all* bad. Plus, it totally sets up the *Disappearance* movie, which was the high point for the series.
>> ARTICLE
Is it worth watching?  Knowing I'm going into a series that has eight episodes of basically the same things doesn't sound very fun to me. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch the 1st, 2nd, and last episodes of the Endless Eight arc. Everything in between would be just to say you did it. 

To not finish Haruhi would be to not watch the Disappearance movie, and to have not seen the Disappearance movie would be suffering. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch the first and last of Endless Eight(optionally, your choice of middle). It's super important for understanding *Disappearance* which is totally worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
It's a great show  the endless eight was just weird and you really don't need to watch all of the endless eight episodes, just go fast through them and see what is different

and one good reason to watch Haruhi is that you can enjoy watching [The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7311/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Shoushitsu) which is one of my favorite anime movies to date

>> ARTICLE
OK, so the thing that makes the Endless Eight so unbearable is that everything repeats again verbatim, not that they're in a time loop.  Time loops can be fun - Groundhog Day says hi!

Haruhi has a fun cast where things are generally eventful, but even that show couldn't sustain eight straight episodes being the same single episode on repeat.  No show, regardless of cast or scenario, could manage to sustain anybody's interests and be entertaining after that formula.  And I'm of the mind that regardless of how good or bad the episode is, it's all going to become the same level of insufferable by the end.

[Kanon\(2006\)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1530/Kanon_2006) is a bit sadder than Clannad, but nowhere near After Story. 

You'll definitely tear up though. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for replying. I think I'll give it a shot! ;D I'll have my napkins and tub of ice cream beside me lol
>> ARTICLE
I've seen both, owning Clannad/AS on Blu. But I think Kanon, at least for me, is sadder. And only because of one arc, Makoto's. Even thinking about her arc I get teary-eyed and sometimes outright sniffely. I don't know why it affected me so, but it did. And still does. Even know, writing this and remembering it, my eyes are watering. 

Overall, Clannad and AS are sadder, but just that arc, of poor Makoto, gets me going.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I'm kind of scared to see Kanon now lol. I'm almost done watching Kokoro Connect and I planned on watching Kanon afterwards haha
>> ARTICLE
I know right?

That's the first piece of animation that made me cry like an emotional schoolgirl lol. I can't get through the final episode of that arc without breaking down.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your answer!

>> ARTICLE
Kanon is *okay*. It's not as good as Clannad and you can really tell that Clannad is really just an 'improved' version of it. 

There are some interesting character arcs and I did cry at one point (which I guess was more than Clannad) but I found the majority of it to be pretty boring and far-fetched.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for responding! Ya know, I've seen clips of Kanon and they did seem pretty bland/boring but cute lol
>> ARTICLE
*Definitely* Clannad: After Story

Kanon is good enough in its own right, but it's more comparable to the first season of Clannad - individual arcs that each have their big emotional climaxes, but nothing on the level of the last two thirds of After Story. I also personally feel the arcs in Kanon are rather hit or miss, but it's still definitely worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for responding! Okay, thanks so much for the feedback. Yea, I truly balled my eyes out in the last two thirds of After Story lol. I might just give it a shot to mark it off my list!
>> ARTICLE
I liked Kanon more but Clannad AS is certainly more emotional.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your feedback! I'll give it a shot!
>> ARTICLE
they both make me laugh with their asspulls and  nonsense
>> ARTICLE
The fucking downvotes every time I see a clannad post are ridiculous. I'm so sorry, friend :( Here's my upvote to try and soften the blow.
>> ARTICLE
I would say Clannad. It was the first anime to make me cry and still one of the very few. 

Kanon wasn't very sad for me personally but I still enjoyed it overall.
>> ARTICLE
Kanon 2006 easily for me.

I just couldn't get invested in the plot in Clannad. But I think the fact I couldn't stand Nagisa had a lot to do with that. If bad things happen to characters you don't care for then you can't really react to it.

I loved the characters and the plot for Kanon 2006 so it affected me far more when bad things happened to the characters.
>> ARTICLE
For me it goes Clannad AS, then Air TV, then Clannad, then Kanon 06.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Clannad first.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Do you normally ask if you can start reading a book from the halfway point? Because that's what it'd be like in this case.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Thanks for the snark tensorpudding. Actually, in order to become interested in a series, I sometimes intentionally watch episodes from the second season of something. That way, I can see the characters after the writers have learned to write for the characters. This would be true for a lot of shows. The first season can sometimes be hit or miss and watching the writers and actors fumble about can be off putting to the point where I might miss out on something that gets good.
>> ARTICLE
People ask this kind of thing all the time. It's mind-boggling
>> ARTICLE
Clannad After Story is probably one of my favorite shows of all time, while Clannad took me months of forcing myself through because I could never get into it. Despite this large discrepancy in my enjoyment though I cannot beseech you not to skip Clannad enough. The shows purpose is really to set up After Story, and the inevitable payout is immense. While you could theoretically skip to After Story just by reading a quick plot summary, you would not be connected to the characters like you should and your enjoyment would suffer from that.  
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. I appreciate you saying that the original Clannad was tough to get into, but that the payoff is big. This will help me to power through. Since they both have high rankings, I won't skip them.
>> ARTICLE
It's called Clannad *After Story*...
>> ARTICLE
NO.NONOONO.

You must watch Clannad. It's purpous is to make you fall in love with the characters and give them back story's. After Story only works because of it. Please, just trust me. Watch Clannad first and then After story...it will also hit you insanely in the feels since you have a new baby..good luck.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the recommend. Sometimes the sequels have more money and thus more talent to throw around. I wanted to make sure it was worth it to start at the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
It definitely is, it would be like starting a series at episode 25. Really, just look at it like 1 thing, not season 1 and season 2. 
>> ARTICLE
To piggyback, if you skipped Clannad and went start to After Story, you would miss out on Fuu.
>> ARTICLE
This was kinda what I was wondering. My original question was designed to find out if we would be missing out on huge plot points. Some series can sum up their backstory in a ten minute story till now montage. This one seems to benefit from watching from the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
No worries. I am glad to hear you will end up watching it from the beginning! Also if you find some part(s) confusing, I am pretty sure if you watch it till the very end, it will make sense. Also there is an episode at the end of Clannad and AS which is an alternate universe thing (hopefully I am not confusing you) which has no "real" ties to the plot so just a heads up!  
>> ARTICLE
Okay. Will keep these things in mind. 
>> ARTICLE
Clannad then Clannad After Story

Any other way is the wrong way
>> ARTICLE
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ASK THIS?

WHY WOULD YOU EVEN BOTHER TO WRITE THIS COMMENT? It really is not a question that has any elaboration.

I seriously don't remember anymore lol, that was a long time ago when i started watching anime. I guess i said that because there are animes that i would watch rather than Bebop. It's really great, but not that "holy shit" great. I have to watch it again some day, wish it wasn't episodic.
>> ARTICLE
I see lol I have anime that I would rather watch than Bebop but I still think it's one of the best out there. Different perspective I guess.

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, while it's a great classic, a classic shouldn't be held to a higher value than newer anime simply because it's a classic. That's called being biased.
>> ARTICLE
But how did Bebop come to be considered a classic? It has an interesting, compelling story with a fantastic ending, unique characters, fantastic animation that still holds up to newer animation and it has one of the best soundtracks in all of anime. All of these contribute to why it's considered a class and are why it should be in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it does have all of that, and that's exactly why I call it a great anime. However, putting it in the top 10 of all anime isn't as cut and dry as that. There are plenty of anime that are as you described, certainly more than 10. A top 10 list simply cannot be anything but subjective. So it's not a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10. The top 10 on MAL is simply a popularity figure, it's not objective at all. It's a rough approximation of an anime's true worth at its best.
>> ARTICLE
That's true and since it's all subjective and this is all based on my opinion, *I* think it's a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I strongly believe it doesn't deserve top 10.

 Bebop is great, but it's episodic, and many people prefer a coherent story over a series of short stories, even if the characters and settings are interesting

Downvotes for not believing a show is top 10? I even think it's good, just not top 10 anime of all time... wtf.
>> ARTICLE
So much this yes. I watched Bebop only 2 days ago after my 3 years of Anime watching only to see that it is damn overrated. Characters were great, sound was amazing, stories were entertaining and execution was top notch. One of the best shows I have watched but it seriously lacked a plot. You can easily make connections with characters but events were so unrelated you never feel the show as a whole to like it so much. Just look at  [Cowboy Bebop](/s "what happened to Julia after all that hype? She just died."). You are exactly right about the show being episodic. Thus there is no room for Bebop at top 10. 

When I see people claim Bebop is one of the best shows I think that people are trying to show off that they pick a classic old show as their favorite to feel somehow superior against the people who like new, popular stuff. It is the same as people hating on SAO for no apparent reason other than it being popular. I didn't watch the second season but first season was definitely a good entertaining normal show. Same hate on Kirito too. Kirito is not some outstanding character to be the favorite character for anyone but he is not that notable as a bad character to become anyone's most hated character either. Just because he is popular, no reason to hate on him to show off your *unique/s* and *mature/s* taste.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial. It's kind of like saying a SOL show is better than an action/adventure show just because it fits into the SOL genre and a certain group of people like SOL more.

People having a problem with the actual content of an episodic show is one thing but saying it's not great *because* its episodic is completely different.

>> ARTICLE
If you're issue is being invested in the fate of the characters, because at the end of the episode everything reverts back to ~ status quo, and there's no longer arc to get heavily invested in the characters.




>> ARTICLE
This isn't necessarily true.  Certain episodic shows have more development per episode than others.  Not all episodic shows are law and order.
>> ARTICLE
That's a different issue that has to deal with the actual content of the episodes including the characters.

Also, Bebop does have an overarching story that's highlighted in specific episodes that helps you feel connected to the characters. If Bebop was really a completely episodic show with no main plot then the ending wouldn't have hit as hard as it did.
>> ARTICLE
>I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial

If a work from of a medium tailored for storytelling falls short on storytelling, it's a pretty legitimate argument to make.
>> ARTICLE
I agree but that comes down to the actual story being told not simply the format of storytelling.
>> ARTICLE
Never understood the hype. Watched it a few years back because it's supposedly divine and untouchable, but it looked rather bland to me.
>> ARTICLE
It's episodic nature isn't for everyone. I could defend it all day long as my favorite anime but the most recent rewatch thread had really great write ups and does a much better job. If you read some (episode 5 and the last few are probably the better ones) you may find some appreciation for it.

Noragami was not in the top 100 before the top 100, so it's the newest member because it's a completely new entry. Haikyuu!! season 1 was already in the top 100, and while it moved up due to season 2, it isn't really a new member.

Irionically I feel that after signing up to MAL back around August 2015, I've rated some of my favorite shows of the past with rose-colored glasses.  Like, I'm pretty sure if I rewatched R.O.D. OVA now, it would no longer be 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I go back maybe once a year and re-rate things to more match what Im feeling over the long term.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously look at the numbers for 2011-2014 3/4 years have 9 entries and 2013 must've been a pretty barren year to only get 5. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, Japan produces ~5x as many shows a year these days, so you might want to take that into account.
>> ARTICLE
Also the fact that (just like movies, books, music 
, etc.) people and generations change - thier interests and perceptions shift, tropes go in and out of fashion. It's fine not to like something classic because it was made by different folks for different folks. Things that transcend that are very rare. Worst case scenario - this shows that the average MAL user is around 20. Maybe even not because there are less older users but because in the past decade or so, popularity of manga/anime in the west has exploded.

More often than not, we just have something very dear to us and we can't accept that stuff we don't like surpass it in quality and popularity. Because we want to think that if something is good, we will like it and by extension - if we like something, it must be good. Thus - recency bias explains that away really well for us.
>> ARTICLE
Also animation quality is going up. I don't really care if you think the older style is more appealing; recent shows have been pushing limits with [backgrounds](http://i.imgur.com/aqnN7Zp.gifv), [foregrounds, and effects](http://i.imgur.com/i5pRxBN.gifv).

The only show that really feels like the old cell animation fits better than digital imo is Trigun. I love the graininess, but new animation is definitely higher quality.
>> ARTICLE
I think there is something missing for very specific types of show, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and especially the absolutely gorgeous Ghost in the Shell movie all benefited from either the grittiness and colouring/shading styles of older animation.

I feel its a similar way to how Noir films benefit from being black and white.

The original is not in the top 100.

There was always certain things that bugged me about the original. I wasn't a fan of how the homunculi were handled, I liked the idea of the villain in the original but I thought Brotherhood's was more interesting, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I love father way more than Dante, but at least there was consequences in the original. Everything seems to convenient in brotherhoods end game. There is also the fact that everyone just kinda watched as greed died. Everyone holds brotherhood way higher than the original when in reality they are pretty balanced in their strengthens and faults, but if you have watched the 2003 previously brotherhood becomes a lot better. Where as the opposite is not true.

I imagine watching Brotherhood first is a bit like watching DBZ and then going to the older original Dragonball when it wasn't all about the fights.

This is better. Evangelion not being in the top 200 was giving me serious buttpain. Also glad to see Disappearance closer to the #1 position it once upon a time righteously held.

I'm actually disgusted by the fact that everyone keeps mentioning evangelion like it's the greatest masterpiece ever and then I look at it's myanimelist rating and I think it is where it should be, similiar about the mentions of madoka magica.

And then there is Hajime no Ippo, a show that is so damn good, yet people won't try it cause there is some "pact" that people don't want to watch sports anime, and only mention of it is when someone asks other good sports anime in a haikyuu!! (great anime though) thread, and it gets mentioned afterwards fucking baby steps...

Death note to me is Light vs L. That's where the anime ends.

[But](/s "didn't L die in episode 25, not 18?")

L vs Light, not L *with* Light
>> ARTICLE
NGE is either the most impactful anime on art in general or the third msot impactful ever. I mean, we're talking about *an anime* which influenced the *Western film industry* more than a lot of actual Western film masterpieces ffs. NGE is like 100x more important to science fiction than GITS is for any **real** sci-fi fan and sci-fi is a lot bigger than just anime! You seriously have to be like 15 if you don't understand how big of a fucking deal NGE is, when in just anime alone it popularized (didn't originate, necessarily) huge swathes of standard tropes and is at most the second most impactful show for the industry (after the original astroboy ofc).

EDIT: You're like someone who is insulting the position of Diablo 2 as possibly the most influential video game that will ever be produced after, like, the early 80's.
>> ARTICLE
That is of course one way of looking at it. Again, it is a good anime - masterpiece? I don't think so.

By that, I'll put Dragonball and Z as a masterpiece, even though it had it's flaws. I even rate DBZ higher than evangelion  as an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not a masterpiece. If you really can't recognize that it was a masterpiece and one of the most impactful works of anime or science fiction of the 90's, [you've got a serious disease for which there is no cure.](http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarCHcNNbZRIpsyY/giphy.gif)

Are you serious? How can you say it is even a masterpiece by todays standards when it is rated low compared to other anime... the point stands that its only 8.3 and maybe higher/lower in other forums. I agree with that rating. That rating shouldn't be called a fucking masterpiece.

What does it matter that it was influential in anime. Do you think Survivor (still a great show) is also a masterpiece cause it greatly influenced reality tv shows? 
>> ARTICLE
Um, It's got a low rating because it's actual art and a lot of people can't handle the concept of anime as art, not because it deserves such a shitty low rating. Just take your shit opinions and go troll somewhere else, mate.

Are you kidding me? How is my opinion troll? You are the one being ignorant here that you can't understand that people just don't think it's that amazing.what does actual art even mean? Are you some kind of snob who thinks their opinion is better than others?

I've just noticed a lot of people who are disgusted by OPM even being on the list. Even if you don't enjoy the action or comedy, it's confusing that people can think it's not objectively a well made anime, even with all the praise it has earned.

OPM isn't even my favorite from this year.

I think it deserves top 10, there's a reason why it's so well loved and famous.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. You're absolutely correct in that there's a reason it's well loved and famous. It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

/u/icedino said (implied, rather) that OPM isn't top ten material. To be fair, that's his own opinion and he's entitled to it, just as you're entitled to your own. More people than not found it to be top ten material, so by definition it's top ten material, assuming it holds its place in the coming months. It's just not necessarily in EVERYONE'S top ten.
>> ARTICLE
> It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

Also hype. Let's not kid ourselves, there are so many anime series that can be considered better but simply don''t have the amount of mainstream hype OPM does. Hell even in the top 100. Do you think the average mainstream anime fan has heard of LogH or Cross Game? They're still in the top 100 for a good reason. The reason why CG or LoGH don't have a huge anti-movement is *because* it hardly ever gets talked about (respective to huge hypes like SAO/AOT/OPM that is).
>> ARTICLE
I think it's too soon to say whether or not OPM is top 10 *of all time* material. A few seasons from now we'll be able to tell whether it's high rating is because of it's recent hype or because everyone truly believes that it's the 7th best anime of all time.

I know you're most likely using the term "recency bias" to fuck with me again, but that doesn't apply here *at all.* 

People aren't choosing between two different anime, you're just scoring them separately. You don't have to choose between Cowboy Bebop or Hunter x Hunter for 10/10's, it's not a contest like that. And it's not as if people are saying "Oh wow, this anime just came out in 2015! That makes it automatically better than this 2001 anime." nor is it the case that because recent anime are going to tend to be more popular (OPM is at #91 in popularity anyways) that they'll automatically rank in the top 100 as Ashita no Joe, Ping Pong, and LoGH have proven.

I wonder if OPM didn't get that much hype that it could take a higher spot. I mean before the anime was announced the One Punch Man community was at least average in number but still a little unknown. /r/OnePunchMan didn't even have their own subreddit style and I'm happy just to see a reference out of nowherein reddit. It was one manga that if you read before the adaptation, you couldn't imagine to be animated just because of the art(of the manga).
>> ARTICLE
If they animated it in ONE's style it could have become another Ping Pong :)
>> ARTICLE
Very likely.  People would have regarded it as an underrated gem with the quality of its animation.  Personally, the show was extremely entertaining and interesting from start to finish and I think it deserves all the praise it gets.  It's definitely not a perfect show, but that's not really saying much when talking subjectively.  In another time and place, the detractors of the show could have been its defenders.

The Kyoukai no Kanata entry confused me at first because I knew the series was a lot lower, and it's seem like the few fans that liked the series are the ones who voted high on the film...But with the exception of that (can't find another in a similar case), it seems like a good job with the listing. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for others, but the film is probably higher because it provided a satisfying ending, which the original series was seriously lacking.
>> ARTICLE
When you say you combined series, do you mean you averaged the scores or did you just take the highest ranked entry in the series? It looks like you did the latter, but that can be pretty misleading since later entries in series almost always receive higher scores due to people who disliked the original not bothering to continue.
>> ARTICLE
The list is intended to be relatively useful, not an absolute ranking.  It helps to remove half the list because of duplicates / semi-duplicates.  I know whenever I looked at MAL for "top x" in order to check out stuff I may watch, I've always been super annoyed that I have to scroll down pages to avoid Gintama repeats, etc.
>> ARTICLE
True, but I think there can be problems with either approach: there are franchises where the first one or more installments are well-received and then things go downhill. Kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't...
>> ARTICLE
I did the latter. I'll probably make another one that averages as well in a week or two. There is a problem with both options though. Due to the rating that MAL ratings work, long running shows like Hunter x Hunter or One Piece only have the ratings of people who have seen most of the show are counted. I'll probably be making more of this with different methods to try and get a more general idea in the future.

So far I'm thinking of making top 100 lists that:

1. Average everything
2. Only includes the initial/first aired season
3. Only includes the most recent season

>> ARTICLE
Oh, I didn't know that long runners only counted ratings from people who've watched most of the show. No wonder so many of them end so on high on MAL. That'd complicate this kind of ranking even more.
>> ARTICLE
1/100

Do I have bad taste? No.. No. It's everyone else who's wrong.

If I ~~have enough time~~ stop being lazy I could make one which takes the averages of each entry and its sequels/whatevers.

All anime is subjective just like movies and any other medium.  Honestly, I found it to be good, but not amazing.

Definitely wasn't a gateway series for me, but I'm a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I felt FMA:B to be equally good, or better. I wouldn't call it a battle shounen, but I would call it a family adventure show. Pretty much just Avatar.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's harder to accept mediocre shows being so highly rated or great shows barely making the list.
>> ARTICLE
from the top 100 any romance/harem  in there?
>> ARTICLE
Ouran High School Host Club is the only harem anime in there.

Romance has a lot. Clannad:After Story, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Ruroni Kenshin, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, the Monogatari Series, Bakuman, Howl's Moving Castle, Kara no Kyoukai, Hotarubi no Mori e, The Tatami Galxy, Major, Nana, Cross Game, Nodame Cantabile, Romeo no Aoi Sora, Sakamachi no Apollon, The Girl who Leapt through Time, Toradora, Spice and Wolf, Tsubasa, Ouran High School Host Club, Sakurasou, Rose of Versailles, Welcome to the NHK, and Honey and Clover.
>> ARTICLE
thanks for that, ,gonna check them 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is also a harem, even if mal doesnt say so (at least by defenition).
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari and Clannad (first season) are technically harem anime, they just aren't labelled as such by MAL for whatever reason.
>> ARTICLE
You missed Kyoukai no Kanata in your list - very strong romance subplot in that one, overwhelming the action/youmu stuff really.

>  Ruroni Kenshin

Is that really considered a "Romance"?  I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a *small* subplot IIRC.  Though I only watched through the Shishio arc so dunno if it gets more emphasis later on, but from what I recall the romance aspect wasn't much stronger than Naruto's.

Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance, but I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series since they are 1000% different in just about everything.
>> ARTICLE
> Is that really considered a "Romance"? I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a small subplot IIRC.

Nope it is not, RK cannot be considered a romance anime. It might involve romance in it (which it doesn't really btw but that's another topic) but RK is not a "romance anime" as the focus is completely different.

> Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance
It had more but even then it is still minimal considering the story in general. The things it focuses on is much more different. 

> I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series

OP made some huge mistakes in the list. Some shows still have more than one entry with different adaptations and movies like Fate/s Evangelion but made some omitting with others. I understand that he merged 3 seasons of the Gintama and Benizakura movie was a recap but why add Final Chapter as well. RK suffers from this the most because the movies and the original series are too far away from each other many people wouldn't believe they are the parts of the same series. '96 TV series of Rurouni Kenshin and Star Wars are more similar to each other than   original series and Trust&Betrayal OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
Mind you, Ouran is a reverse harem. A great one, and really funny, but the MC is still a girl, which will probably put some people off.
>> ARTICLE
Ouran is like one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen. it's very good to pass the time and be relaxed while laughing your ass off
>> ARTICLE
In case anyone is reading this, hasn't seen it, and thinks they might be put off by the reverse harem bit: try it anyway. Please. It's a good fucking show.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I greatly enjoyed both the manga and anime, like I said it's great, but some people will(sadly) be put off by the fact that it's a reverse harem, even though it's nothing like say Diabolik lovers or Dance with Devils. I can recommend it to everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Great effort, thanks! 

Have watched about half of the list.
>> ARTICLE
47/100
i need to watch more high rated shows.
>> ARTICLE
What's interesting about a consolidated lost like this is that the upward push of Eva 2.22 (which was highly received by fans) carried all the Rebuilds 47 spots ahead of the original series.

Obviously the original show is > than the Rebuilds but it's interesting to see how a superior movie/episode in a set of OVAs can influence the whole.

Anyway--great job on the list, OP this helps me know more of a real top 100 I can pick and watch from!
>> ARTICLE
Well that's because the OP just congregates EVERY spinoff and sequels and prequels while compiling the list. He did NOT average scores. As someone else said, franchises with multiple seasons that people would have dropped cause they didn't like the first ones are bound NOT TO watch and berate the latter ones. That's how you get Aria who's only got one really high rated season (Origination) while the rest were 8/10 or lower. That makes this list a bit misleading.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Haikyuu at 12
>> ARTICLE
I love haikyuu too! Though I believe it will drop just a bit and Hajime no Ippo (my favorite sport anime) will surpass it!

I'm still stunned DBZ isn't on here.

This gives more of a insight about a franchise's popularity, thanks for the list OP!

I've seen like 10 of those, lmao. I've got only about other 15 on my PTW too. TIL I'm an anime hipster I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Well, there are so many more shows I like outside of top100 than within it. Polarizing shows are not neccessarily bad, but get mediocre scoring by definition. Long-running shows also have a higher scores because only fans stick to watching it. And just as newer shows start off with high ratings, that decay over time, really old shows are rated higher than they are worth because of nostalgia. I would most definitely rate DBZ higher than if I would watch it now for the first time. I think most people don't really take the top100 seriously.
>> ARTICLE
34/100. It's sad to look at this and realize some amazing anime aren't on the list while some really bad ones are. A good example would be that Haibane Renmei is not on the list while it's much inferior rip-off, Angel Beats is...

It also lacks Berserk, the original FMA, GiTS movie, Princess Tutu...
>> ARTICLE
Recency bias :D.  And demographic bias ...
>> ARTICLE
How is angel beats a rip off or Haibane renmei? They are completely diffirent and the only thing they have in common is a story being about dead people.
>> ARTICLE
35 finished.
5 dropped.

And seeing Shigatsu in Top 10 hurts more then anything.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked shigatsu. in my mind it deserves its spot in the top 10 way more than one punch man, which I dropped after 5 episodes. however I can see how people like it and even though I dont think it deserves to be that high, I understand that it is there.
in the end it just comes down to taste :/

I thought Berserk would be there... it's better than some in this list. Both the anime series and the third movie.

The anime is basically a generic action shounen, but it is *very good* for an action shounen, comparatively.  The pacing, action, characters are all fairly tight.  I'd rate it among the top 5 generic action shounen quite easily.

A lot of these titles feel very over inflated with their list placement due to sheer popularity. Your Lie in April seems like the most overrated anime of the past few years to me; it wasn't bad though. I'm happy OPM is pretty high on the list. I don't know if it deserves top 10 but it's definitely had an impact on the anime medium. Probably for the better.

Why can't we do that?

It would be a whole lot simplier to sort through my list of 4 different fate seasons/films/OVAs or whatever, not to mention you don't miss an OVA or film when you were looking for an series to watch because you didn't see the others adaptions/sequels tab in the info page.

for the curious, check out legend of the galactic heroes. it's a very good scifi anime. it's dialogue heavy with a lot of political intrigue, but there's enough action to satisfy. if i were to compare it to a live action show, i'd say it's like a grittier battlestar galactica.

"6- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988)"

Any advice about this anime? is it worth? is it better than newer shows? or maybe its just more nostalgic points.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very talky space opera. It's by no means perfect: the animation is often quite limited and sometimes error prone (both problems are most common near the show's beginning), for example, and the animation and direction don't always convey the scale and details of the battles that well. And leaving aside actual problems, it's not something which everyone would enjoy watching. As I said, it's talkative, plus it's very sincere and not terribly interested in being hard science fiction.

That said... if you do have any appreciation at all for space operas, or dialogue-driven political/military stories, it's worth a shot because it is very satisfying to watch. It's unique in anime for the size of its cast and kind of unique for the ambition of its storythere are longer anime, but there aren't many which can do 110 episodes of continuous epic narrative with no filler. It's pleasingly capacious in its ideas: it doesn't necessarily get very incisive about any one ideology or behaviour but it includes so many ideas and arguments and incidents. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is certainly 'better than newer shows' in the sense that nothing since has done, or has even really been able to attempt to do, the kinds of things that it does.

So I'd say it's worth giving it a try if it interests you, though you shouldn't feel obliged to watch it and if you do try it and dislike it that's fine.

> nostalgic points

This is unlikely, because the show was only made widely available with an English translation in the mid to late 2000s. I'd bet that a substantial majority of the people on MAL who've seen it saw it within the last decade. From my memory it was almost unknown among English-speaking fans until 2007 or 2008, when it gradually took off.

There is a clear(and unsurprising to me) recency bias. It also seems several genres are more in the list than others, i.e. shonen, romance, supernatural and action, whereas harem seems underpresented(Monogatari and Ouran?). Theres also a distinct lack of cute girls doing cute things - anime

Great work OP

fucking Katekyo Hitman Reborn? seriously? jesus people, i don't really like some of this show but i get why they're so popular, but reborn? that's just wrong, it had a good premise and the first couple arc were good, but after that it became just complete trash, its one of the most generic, repetitive, stereotyped, poorly written shonen i've ever seen

i just don't get it


>> ARTICLE
Well you obviously won't agree but what I loved about it was that it was just a fun show. The characters were fun, the action was fun, the plot was fun, etc. Characters like Gokudera, Lambo, Hibari, Squalo...they really did do a great job of making them feel like a family. I started to love the characters so much that I didn't even mind the "daily life" episodes and began to miss them a bit

Plus it was amazingly creative. Small touches like the ten-year bazooka added so much flavor to the show for me. Not to mention the abilities that each character had and some of the really spectacular fight scenes (Yamamoto vs Squalo, Gokudera vs Gamma, Hibari vs Genkishi, Tsuna vs Xanxus, etc)

I won't deny that the show has more than its fair share of problems (sexism, Tsuna constantly realizing his resolve comes from protecting his friends, filler arcs) but it is pretty special to me 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm ... KHR was pretty generic as a shounen but it went beyond generic a bit with the expansion of its scope through the middle of the series.  So, I felt it "ramped up" then stayed in good, high gear all the way until the very end where they rushed the last few episodes pretty hard.

At the end of the day it still remains a "shounen+" to me, so nothing super outstanding, but I rate is as definitely a step above average and "100"th place isn't really overrating it, IMO.

6/100 dropped because of too much episode (and already read manga) (FMA, Gintama, One Piece, Chihayafuru, Monster, Hunter X Hunter)

12/100 Dropped because no enjoyment and bored when watching, some of it I just skipped to read the ending (Steins Gate, Shigatsu, Ping pong, Jojo, Kuroko, Noragami, Fate UBM, Shirobako, Toradora, Katanagatari, Bakuman, Psycho Pass)

Shirobako is the only one I could think of since that anime has no flaws at all (I haven't found one bad thing about it), all the characters are likable and have their own unique personalities and there's no single thing I hate about that anime. Also, it really describes the anime industry almost accurately, from the Director's draft to the dubbing, it's somehow educational in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I'd rather have a mind blowing, reality shattering show with flaws than a tame "flawless" anime.

Not to say that Shirobako's boring by any means, of course. I just think your argument is invalid. It's like saying a picture of a perfectly drawn circle is superior to Guernica, to take a famous example.

It's 6 eps long. You could just watch it whenever you want.
>> ARTICLE
It's the predecessor to Gurren Lagann AND Evangelion with a tinge of Interstellar and Pacific Rim along with having one of the greatest endings to anything ever.  

For being only being 6 episodes, it's utterly fantastic. Don't go in expecting the same amount of depth as a 26 episode series, go in expecting a 6 episode mecha anime. I reccomend watching it in one sitting, like a long movie. First 2 episodes might take a while to get through.

Then the sequel, Diebuster, is more like a mix of FLCL and TTGL. Again, only 6 episodes too.

I don't really have any "favorite" anime, since I just watch for the experience and hardly ever rewatch anything. What I do instead is structure my scoring system around what I liked the most. If something comes along and tops everything, then I'll just shift everything else downwards. I started with 6 as my lowest score and I'm down to 2 already. If I had to chose though I'd probably go with Madoka Magica, since it has everything I look for in an anime.

There are many anime that i would give 9/10 or 10/10 but one that I felt that deserves an 11/10 completley based on the Beautiful way they portrayed such an awful topic..... **terror in ressonance**  definitely gets my vote for this one, I would also have to agree with OP on **FMA:B** being a top anime aswell
>> ARTICLE
I think terror in resonance is one of the best anime to come out in recent years and is currently placed at my number 5 spot of favorite anime of all time.

When that happened I had to tone down all the other series in my list 1 point. And now, when I rate, I think "okay, this felt like a 8/10, now let's take out the 'Not A Masterpiece' tax, so this is a 7/10".

And this whole 11/10 mentality is just silly because no audiovisual work is perfect to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
11/10 isn't flawless. Everything is subjective in art. I personally find NGE to be more of a masterpiece because of all of it's flaws 
>> ARTICLE
Explain.
>> ARTICLE
10/10 doesn't mean flawless. Citizen Kane is one of the greatest movies of all time but it's got a major plot hole. The point is that the plot hole doesn't matter to what the movie accomplishes.

This is similar to how NGE plays out. It's plot is a fucking mess and it's got so many wasted epiodes on stupid shit, but it doesn't diminish what the series really does or how much impact the final few episodes plus EoE had. The same goes for shows like Bakemonogatari and Madoka Magica. They surpass regular series because they're art, they aren't just your run of the mill 9/10 series. They do things that elevate them past just a show with a good theme or really good characters. They feel human, they resonate with people in the most amazing ways, and to me that's what elevates them past shows that you would just say were "flawless". 

For NGE specifically I was saying how you could really feel all the odd changes in the series and reading about what was going on during Anno's life and what was going on during production makes it very special. It really feels like it reflects the director.

no, bad Chun, you don't laugh at someone's taste. you're better than this!!                      
                     
as for whether or not any audiovisual work can be regarded as perfect, I think you have a point, and it stands on some interpretations of film studies and lit criticism, but, that doesn't mean you should posit it as fact, when that view is no longer one regarded in academia as being totally right. asserting that perfection is intangible and that there is no work above perfection makes sense when viewed with a traditional approach that regards factors like consistent delivery of formal and functional elements into the Mise-en-scene, but ignore the emotional, cultural, and humanist implications of how works may be able to delivery formally and functionally beyond the constraints of a medium, as post-structuralist and post-modernist critics emphasized through the 70's til today. perfection can be achieved between a retentive viewer and a work of art under the tenants of New Historicism, for example. relativist schools of critical theory in that same vein will argue that interaction between an artist, through their work, and the audience, through interacting with the work, establish meaning outside of quantifiable terms. I can pull up a few textbooks on the issue if you want me to I guess, but the generally accepted shift in current scholastic trends is that perfection *is* qualifiable, because of extenuating factors that cannot be understand through direct critical discourse. 
                    
                     
attempting to dissect a work on its technical merits will reveal this, as a work can easily be graded positively for how it conveys meaning in a way that reaches one audience (perhaps the intended audience) just as it may be considered a fault in the eyes of another audience (take the anime fandom buzzword "forced drama" and its wild implications when one tries to explain how drama "works" and how it doesn't; if it worked for someone, how can it be said it doesn't work? if it didn't work for someone else, how can it be said that it does? you and I have disagreed before on the delivery of OreGairu season 2, for example, and just as someone might side with you but go on further to say that it captured the emotional characterization of its cast *perfectly* and have that make sense in their own mind, someone on my side may go further than me and say it did so *worse than any work ever made* and have it make sense to them.)
>> ARTICLE
> no, bad Chun, you don't laugh at someone's taste. you're better than this!! 

My b Spiranix :(

I mostly agree with this. I just wanted to add that there is no inherent fault for an audiovisual work to be an imperfection because our assessments and analysis on them are based on subjective methodologies that may or may not work in favor of the anime we are focusing on. Does this anime resonate with this particular viewer? Is it compelling? How were the themes delivered to its audience? While one interpretive approach may classify a particular anime as perfect, others will most certainly find flaws found within its overall form. 

> you and I have disagreed before on the delivery of OreGairu season 2, for example

I don't remember this. Is it related to the shift with tone in Oregairu's narrative?

So! [Lets use this as reference](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3340) I know, it's the dub. It was the first one I saw on youtube.

So! Let's clear some things up as we begin: Right = Past. Left = Future. I can prove it but just take my word for it for the time being. And also: this is from the perspective of Takaki Tohno. I mean the singer is parallel to the point they he Takaki might as well just be the singer.

***

We begin by showing both characters stepping to the right as they begin this journey into the past(*It's like that's what this montage is going to do! wooo!*).

At [56:35](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3395) we see Takaki sitting ON THE RIGHT(*I actually really love that image. The second act is by far my favorite. The matching cuts of the first scene(26:05) and last scene(47:32),showing that even though he has physically grown up he hasn't moved on in any way since he was with Akari.*) being all reminiscent as we see what he was truely thinking about every time he sat up there on the hill: Akari.

At[ 56:44](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3401) we see that both did actively write letters back and forth and did actually look forward to receiving letters. at 56:46 we see a match cut that(*and if you look back on the previous images*) that show the passage of seasons. Sunny to rainy to snowing, you get the picture. This shows that it wasn't that the two had some great big falling out. They simple drifted away from one another as time passed.At 56:51 we see Takaki walk TOWARDS a mailbox signifying that he still believes that he will see Akari in his future. We then see Akari walking away from the mailbox and looking back. She has moved on. She will look back and remember Takaki from time to time but she is still moving forward with her life.

[57:18](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3438) is an interesting shot. He's boarding a plane to travel back to Tokyo. Leaving Kanae and returning to where Akari lives. Pay attention to placement and location: walking to the right(past), then we see Kanae in the center of the shot, stagnant. A couple images flash by and we see Kanae leave, once again, center of screen: stagnant.

[57:55](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3475) Things start moving fast now, I might not link to the specific times but I shall do my best! Nice quick little cut MOVING TO THE RIGHT of Takaki reminiscing about Akari.

[58:06](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3486) This scene I like more of how it tells a story of their entire relationship in under 5 seconds.She (Idk her name atm, I think it's Riza.)...Riza is dedicated to their relationship and pictures him as her future. However, While Riza is thinking about him, He's drinking at a Bar. We then get a glimpse of their actual relationship. They shared a bed but slept as far away from one another as possible. 

Continued: As he picks up to take a drink we see Akari, Happy and with another man. ANYONE who has gone through a bad breakup imagines this. (It's awful. Like seriously, when you are sitting alone at night, wallowing in your lonliness and there's that nagging thought in the back of your head that's telling you the woman you love is happy with someone else. It's shit.)

Next we had some nice little cuts of that match Takaki to the singer of the song. seeing Akari in places she simply wouldn't be.

[58:41](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3521) We have sort of an inverse match cut? Basically, what this scene is telling me is that back when they were both children Takaki believed he was always the one moving forward. She was the one that initiated with her letter after they had moved away. He believed that she was clinging on to him. We have a series of quick cuts that actually sort of illustrate that. It's brief but telling.

[58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5eMYyCYwVg&feature=youtu.be&t=3401) It's a bright new day! I believe this is signalling the turning point. Takaki has more or less moved on. He's gotten his life together.(*See end of post for details*) We see both main characters catch a cherry blossom(*The symbol of their childhood relationship*). Akari holds it for a second before releasing it, turning around, smiling, and heading inside. Takaki closes his hand around it. Not tightly but he doesn't let it go. He hasn't quite moved on entirely. 

At [59:12](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3552) there is a very unique angle to this film. I don't believe this style of angle is ever used before this scene. It's meant to imply mystery, or a question. You don't quite know how Takaki will end up. He's, at that very moment, in a state of not decisively left or right. He's been working to move toward the future and let go of his past but here he is, literally within arms reach of his past. 

Then at 59:21 we have the famous train scene. I love it. It's going right. And as I said before, Right is the past. That train crossing is the symbol of his barrier. He has crossed beyond his slump of dwelling on what cannot be( Once again, I'll explain after) but he still has the choice to run back to Akari. And then the train shifts to moving to the left.(*In my head I imagine him taking a deep breathe and holding it as he debates internally what he should do. Internally he agrees to accept this as they are and continue moving forward as the trains switch and he releases his breathe. His posture relaxes, and there's no one there. There's no longer that chain holding him back.*) 

He smiles faintly, and takes one final step to the left.

Also: It should be noted that the ending theme song reflects almost exactly how I believe Takaki felt about life in general( and how I feel about life.)towards the end of the film. Yes, it's slow, and plain. And he sometimes fall down and stop moving forward. But those are the times you need to push yourself the hardest.

 If you listen to the song, it doesn't have a steady pace. And it moves fastest after it falls. Whenever I listen to this song I imagine a person, walking . Slowly, speeding up a slightly at times. Then at [1:00:30](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3630) He falls. collapsed on the ground, he doesn't move and begins to cry. And then he starts to crawl forward, still crying, inch by inch. Then at [1:01:19](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3679), he stops moving forward. He gives up and remains motionless. Then at 1:01:35, he wipes off his face, stands up, and continues. Still simply walking, but standing taller than before. At [1:02:11](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3731) he begins to leave the frame of the shot. Continuing towards whatever his goal is, standing tall.

People say that 5 Centimeters per second is a sad movie, sure. It's somewhat sad. But life is that way. Life is hard, and it really is those little steps day by day that help make you through it.

***

So, this has gone on for a while, but I said I'd inform you why it's happy. Flashback to 48:48, Takaki is working in a clean work space at home. His whiteboard says it is March, and he has work due April. During the rest of Act 3 (minus the very end when colors get bright again) it is February. The dates on phones indicates as much. Yes, Takaki quit his job and hit a low point, but he already bounced back. So I'm tired of people raving about how they think he offed himself after the movie ended. That is all. 

Anyway, I promised my friend to do ranked with him about an hour ago so I should stop. Feel free to message back with any responses or the like.

Edit: I forgot! little bit of a Fun Fact. Place of Takaki during Scenes:

Act 2: Left: 14 vs Right 33

Montage(minus the railroad Xing scene):

Takaki: Left: 7 vs Right: 15

Akari: Left: 7 vs Right: 15

Interesting eh? 
>> ARTICLE
I agree with some of your points. The one thing that I definitely agree with is that the film is not as depressing as people make it out to be especially because of the final cut revealing Takaki's smile.

> Right = Past. Left = Future

I'll have to watch the film again to see if this is true. This connection isn't continuous throughout the film's narrative from what I can remember. Thanks for the answer.
>> ARTICLE
The right/left is continuous in a sense. I mean, during Act 1 there was still a semblance of reality in the hope that Akari and Takaki would be together. But a point comes where they both actually accept that they won't be together. and at that point it shifts. Even Kanae has this, if you remember The Day following the ["Take one step at a time" thing Takaki told Kanae....](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=2363) Kanae runs from right to left. 

If you do rewatch it, literally hang a string to cut your screen in half. It makes you notice more.

Ah Banjo, so we meet again. Fear not, I only come with a simple question for you today. I noticed you rated Shinsekai Yori 10/10. I just started watching it and am on episode 5. The premise as a whole so far has been pretty interesting, but episode 5 specifically was downright awful, severe drop in quality both in animation and direction. Please tell me it goes back to being better and interesting, rather than just weird and disjointed?
>> ARTICLE
> Please tell me it goes back to being better and interesting, rather than just weird and disjointed?

My 10/10 for it should already give you the answer. :P

While I can't specifically say anything about the fifth episode (it has been about a half-year since I've seen the series), what SY does better than almost any other anime is craft a world that is not only believable but cruelly tragic. It's a landscape filled with mystery, intrigue, and despair, the likes of which is pieced together in such a masterful way.

I usually say something along these lines to describe Shinsekai Yori: it's an anime about embracing the mistakes of the past, finding the solutions in the present, and maintaining hope for the future. In other words, humanity is flawed; but that doesn't mean we can't make ourselves better.

Hopefully this gives you the drive to keep watching! :3
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, my drive to continue was never endangered. Just found this episode very odd among the rest and hoped it wasn't the start of a trend for the series.

That's why you should never enter a thread that's soley devoted to a show you haven't seen.  If it makes you feel any better I was spoiled for the same thing and I still enjoyed the show...  
>> ARTICLE
Same here.  I done goofed when I tried typing something in on Google and it was like "oh yeah bro you looking for this?  haha fuck yourself mate get spoiled"

Google is ruthless!  Most of my major spoilers came courtesy of /a.  I just stopped going there.

It has its uses...  it can be a bit fun when you're drunk.  But you have to be on alert for spoilers all the time.  Also shitposters.  

I'll be honest in that spoilers don't ruin shows for me like the do for some people.  In fact that spoiler got me to watch Clannad sooner than I might have.  
>> ARTICLE
It depends, really.  If I had actually known the ending of the first cour of Aldnoah.Zero, aside from /R/FUCKSLAINE, I probably wouldn't have bothered watching it.  Just sort of a show-by-show sorta thing for me.  It did, however, get me to watch it a bit faster as well, as I wanted to feel sad faster because u can get adickted 2 a sirtin kind o' sadnis xddd
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's fine, I mostly blame myself anyway.

I'm sure I'll love the show either way since I get caught up in the moment when I watch stuff and am generally quite emotional.

Not too worried.
>> ARTICLE
I also had this spoiled for me but it still hit me hard.  And, it's honestly doesn't have the same impact as something else that occurs later on in the show (which I also had spoiled for me), so keep that in mind as well.  Just keep on truckin' and enjoy the ride!

Finish the show is all I can say. You will get a resolution, and considering you've liked it thus far, you'll like the end.

The show that I want to have an after story, needs first to animate its 4th season. That show is The World God Only Knows(aka TWGOK). The manga just ended last year, for me the ending was good but its not that satisfying. The show had a really large cast of characters and I would really love to see what happened to them after the ending. Even if its just a in a form of manga a TWGOK after story would be great.

Just so I am certain, you aren't talking about the plot ending but about [TWGOK Manga Spoilers](/s "him ending with Chihirio")?

Since I just finished Usagi Drop, I can't help but feel that I want more. I'd like to follow Rin as she grows up, then maybe going into high school would be interesting. Also see Daikichi get his swag on and get together with Kouki's mom. Perhaps expanding the family later on as well.

I heard things get bad later on.... like [Spoiler](/s "Rin falling in love with Daikichi and them getting together.") Not sure if that really happens, just what i've heard.

That is 100% correct. It's a very strange turn of events.

For you people that have finished NGE and EoE, I'd reallllllly recommend the Re-Take doujinshi series. There's a NSFW version and a SFW version so you can take your pick.

It is an incredibly well done wrap up for the story and I often confuse it's plot developments with that of the canon series; it felt that natural reading it.

After Story will have approximately 1% of the punch without season 1of Clannad. So yes. It's completely necessary. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Don't mouse over this if you havn't seen After Story.
>> ARTICLE
In a word, yes.

The first season of Clannad isn't "awful", granted is vastly not as superior as its sequel in my opinion. It has a lot of memorable moments and its what helps you bond with the characters as you learn their backstories and why they are the way they are. I'd definitely watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Some people don't even mind the first season of Clannad, like me but if you seriously want to watch After Story its not worth it without Clannad

If you want something different than just high school romance, definitely yes.

That's very true
>> ARTICLE
What do you mean is it worth it? It is absolutely necessary.
>> ARTICLE
what the heck, watch it, it's just 23 episodes, its not like you will lose your time in a 100 eps anime. and yes, its necessary to understand the plot of AS
>> ARTICLE
I cant get past ep 5ish. I have tried multiple times but I end up getting really bored and just let its tab in my list eventually get deleted. 

Sure I am disappointed I never get to see why everyone says its so amazing, but when you compare it to stuff that's good from beginning to end, its hard to justify.
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion its great from beginning to end. Because in clannad and clannad AS, it doesn`t take 24 eps to get to first base.
>> ARTICLE
23 episodes is a lot, especially for an anime you're not particularly enjoying.
>> ARTICLE
It's really not. 
>> ARTICLE
It is when you can invest the same amount of (often limited for many people) time in two fantastic series instead of a season of a mediocre one.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is pretty funny, with some nice drama. It's an arguably above average show, it just pales in comparison with After Story. 

Yes, you **need** to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed the first season. I'm assuming your into slice of life anime. It was kind of stereotypical but I thought it was still cute and funny. Predictable harem.    But no you shouldn't skip it. It helps to establish the characters that lead on into the next season. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes. Try to think of it as an investment. You have to wait a while but the payoff is very much worth it.
>> ARTICLE
totally worth it , its build your feeling with the story .
>> ARTICLE
The first season isn't bad it's just really generic
>> ARTICLE
Yes
>> ARTICLE
i would say it is only worth it if you have plenty of time and a lack of interesting shows to watch, i would say try watching season 1, if it isn't interesting don't bother.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it is! The first season of clannad is a bit more slice of lifey with not as much twists and turns but the comedy is AMAZING! and it allows you to grow attachment to the characters which is kind of needed for the entire series.
>> ARTICLE
Sheeeiiit, I just remembered that I still need to finish After Story. I think I stopped after I got spoilered, but now that I saw this thread, I'm going to correct that ASAP.

The first season was pretty damn funny if I remember correctly. I enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't have half the emotional impact as After Story, but damn man, if you don't watch season one then you'll be missing out on a lot. Won't get the full effect. Besides, it's real entertaining on its own, it just isn't on the same level as After Story. Go for it, you won't regret the decision.
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
Its totally worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I liked After Story. I think you wouldn't get the same experience if you watch it without Clannad first season. Good luck :)
>> ARTICLE
You literally need to watch it otherwise all those people that told you that it's amazing would have wasted their time telling you. think of it that way :). It's an absolute must! And it's really not that bad, I tend to laugh more at season 1. But good luck enjoying after story if you don't watch season 1 :/.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. In my opinion, After Story is nothing without the first season.

Sure, it's long. It starts to feel like the average slice of life. But the reason why Clannad is considered to be one of the most tear-jerking/heartbreaking anime is exactly because of the time you spent in the first season.

Think of it as this. First season is somewhat the years you spent in school. Second season is graduation day. All the memories will hit you like a truck slamming into you at 70km/h.
>> ARTICLE
First season of clannad isnt bad, the dub is awful, but totally worth sitting through first season of subs cause it still has a buttload of feels
>> ARTICLE
It is like asking if you should watch the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya first before the 2 two season.
>> ARTICLE
You have to watch the first season or else you won't be as attached to the characters as you should be. Trust me, skipping Clannad will just make After Story less enjoyable for you.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yea its worth it! 

Its funny, well made, and has a good amount of emotional scenes near the end.

I wouldnt say that its as good as After Story(not even CLOSE), but i enjoyed it alot. it had a weird way of keeping me hooked on the characters and the setting without the use of any cliff hangers.

also, Sunohara is awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I'll be devil's advocate. You will probably find AS to be good, but it is not worth it if you do not enjoy the first season. Without even taking into account the lack of empathy you may feel for the characters by that point, the time wasted on 2-cours worth of episodes could be spent enjoying something of better quality.

I love Steins;Gate. But if the recipient of my recommendation is totally bored in the first few episodes, I would not push for them to continue. Time is valuable, and watching 9 hours of a mediocre (imo) romcom is not the best idea.
>> ARTICLE
It's unbearable. I tried as hard as a could to get through it, but couldn't. Skipping to season 2 is not as big of a deal as everyone makes it out to be
>> ARTICLE
If you don't like the first season, then it's not worth watching After Story. It's just more melodrama with idiotic characters.
>> ARTICLE
>If you don't like the first season, then it's not worth watching After Story. It's just the best anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
My friends once forcibly sat me down and made me watch Clannad. I actually don't really like the first season at all. When we watched After Story, my friends had skipped all the way up to around episode 8 or so, right before they graduated highschool. I didn't feel like I was missing anything.
>> ARTICLE
No No No No, not worth the investment. Lots of people like it, some don't. If it doesn't hook you from the start, you could fit two really good series into the time it takes to watch the first just to find out you don't like the second.

To copy something I put in a different thread: "Let me say this as someone who has watched all of Clannad and AS, if you have a limited amount of time, it's simply not worth the build up. Lots of redditors here will say "ah it gets better in AS, it gets better at this arc", but the truth is there are literally hundreds of great series out there that start good, if you say that 1/4 of Clannad is worth the time (that even some fans would probably disagree with), you could fit three small seasons into that.
There's a lot of voices on this subreddit that believe that as long as something gets good, you should watch it and some of these people immediately downvote or shutdown the opinion that it isn't as simple as that. If my friend says to me "Hey isn't alien a great set of films?" and I went "I didn't like the first one", if he then replied "Don't worry it gets better about number 5", I wouldn't say "that's legit, i'll watch them all to see if it gets better". but 4 films ~ the first season of Clannad, so why does anime get this massive exception that films and western TV don't?
TL:DR; Don't make the same mistake I did, if something doesn't hook you a couple of episodes in, then don't bother with it."

Thank you, now I know I'm not the only one who thinks like this. The Aliens example is perfect. 
>> ARTICLE
The first two Alien movies blow everything else in the collection out of the water.

I agree, but I couldn't think of a film series that gets better, because if a film series starts bad I don't watch it.

That's actually relieving.  For all the insanity I have seen on the internet over the years; having someone suggest that the sequels were better than the original Alien movies is the first thing I have read that really made me think "This, this is a crazy person talking."

Problem with Baccano is that the anime deviated quite a bit from the novels near the end. They'd have to change some stuff in order to adapt the new novels.

Fucking kidding me? They remove it but refuse to translate it then get butthurt when people fan-translate it for them? What kind of stupid world is this?

That's just how licensing works. Overall, this is going to support Oregairu and its author in the long run but it does mean us readers will have to stick it out longer. Not much we can do really.

Maybe they should fucking translate it so we can support him

Yea they are notoriously slow, that's the problem. Spyro used to role out translations a month or two after the release and they were really good in terms of quality too. I'm gonna miss his translations. :(

Hah - I clicked through and without even reading the OP, I did a ctrl+F "White Album 2". And... there it was, right in the original post.

I've watched the anime through about four times, have played the VN through what is currently translated twice (second time there was a bit more available than the first), have read all of the various synopses of CC+Coda online, and have considered even writing some fan fiction for it. So, for me, it's not even close.

Always great to see another WA2 fan! When I first watched it, I was relatively new to romance Anime (I watched some romcom and that was about it). I was recommended it by a friend irl and was skeptical at first. But after completing it, I was more than blown away. I've read a few summaries but I have basically forgotten them, and I plan on playing the VN (eventually). I get on youtube and listen the the soundtrack all the time.

I really don't think FMAB scratches the same itch as Death Note. The original FMA might be a better recommendation.

If you found the FMA episode ending to be satisfying and a good way to end the series, don't. Shamballa felt more like an alternative timeline telling of the ending that, for the most part, fell on its face.

really? I thought FMAB did a marvelous job tying all the loose ends
I just finished watching it yesterday and I feel like I had the full experience, no void.

I mean compared to what angel beats, or spice&wolf did to me, this is probably the best ending to an anime I have seen so far.

That's the reason it me left with the void because i know really want more of it but i also know that i don't need to.

the void affects you most when there's loads of episodes and you literally marathon it all. In my case, Dragon Ball Z - I may have skipped a lot. i may have found a lot of it stupid. I may have been very pissed off at both the writer and the main characters, but i still continued watching all of it. it left me empty after it was all over.

Another anime, but it's from a while back so the emotions aren't as fresh, was Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Reinhard, Yang Wenli, i still miss them

I know that feel man, saying goodbye to my Seirin homies was pretty tough to do. I think the movie that's coming next year is Extra Game related so look forward to that. Honestly, they should just make a sequel series with the Miracles as 3rd years and following a different team, and we still haven't learned who won the interhigh before Extra Game, but I'm 90% sure it wasn't Seirin.

I just really want the Kurokoverse to be expanded on, there's so many possibilities for powers and character development (especially for Akashi).

Aside from Clannad: AS, I'd have to say Bunny Drop. It really hit me the same way Clannad: AS did when it was finished. When you know you've just watched something so amazing and that you'll never be able to experience that same feeling from the same thing again.

Hanamonogatari. [You know why] (https://madokami.com/hzh3sq.webm)

The one that left the biggest gap for me personally was TMoHS. Why do i say this? I say this because your never going to find an anime as... bizzare as this one with the same setting and concept and be this good. 

Also the same for Steins;gate and the original Blackjack IMO 
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is definitely in my top three voids (pretty interchangeable with Clannad). Haven't seen any of the Monogatari series yet, but I'm planning on watching Bakemonogatari during winter break. I'll probably watch Black Jack eventually since I'm enjoying Young Black Jack.
>> ARTICLE
Only 28 episode of blackjack are up for legal streaming, out of the 61. Also the 21 series isn't even up for streaming. (which is why i say it leaves a void, kek.)

You know, this reminded me that I should check [Itazura na Kiss](https://youtu.be/65G5GQUIJFA?t=9m41s). And find out why it's overshadowed by Clannad.
>> ARTICLE
Simple answer: because the InK is shit with shitty unlikeable characters you're apparently supposed to cheer for. Main character just eats up all the abuse the douchebag love interest throws at her and we're supposed to find it endearing. Fuck that show.

The ending is a huge asspull, "It was all just a dream" kinda thing. But Akio is best girl so it's cool.

No.. it wasn't.  
>> ARTICLE
The sad death of Nagisa, the trials and tribulations of Tomoya as he struggles to find himself and separate his life from his fathers, the baby girl he neglected and sees himself in, overcoming it and finally moving on from Nagisa's death only to have his child die. Everything is sad and emotional when suddenly:

It didn't happen because of magic robots and floating light orbs or some shit. That's what I call an asspull.
>> ARTICLE
So, another show asked viewers to think about everything they've watched before in order to understand the ending. When viewers don't want to do that, they call it an asspull.

Surely you noticed those orbs before, floating around when Tomoya did something really good for someone. Surely you can work out who the magic robot was, what the orbs stood for, and what the narrative underneath the show has been all about.

Or you could just call it an asspull, write your MAL review easier, and get patted on the back by the remaining percentage of the internet that doesn't understand how to watch a strongly anachronous narrative.
>> ARTICLE
The jump from a real life setting to a magical setting was out of the blue and unnecessary. The other shows like Kanon and Air had magic ingrained from the beginning and throughout, clannad just hit you with ok, I guess this is happening now.
>> ARTICLE
No, Clannad had it ingrained from early on too. The magic-world narrative constantly ran alongside the 'real life' one. Part of the pleasure of Clannad: After Story was slowly uncovering how the two were linked. Characters in the show itself were also aware of it before its significance was put in the foreground.
>> ARTICLE
Out of the blue? The Illusionary World literally started on episode 1 of the first season. Were you just completely blind to it? Are you actually saying Air's plot made more sense?

I just saw a discussion post posted today about episode 796 of Detective Conan / Case Closed. *Episode seven nine six. Seven-Ninety-six. Seven Hundred and Ninety Six.* Jesus christ, I heard people say that it continued past its prime, but man. The discussion looks so stagnant. I love a long series but enough is enough.
>> ARTICLE
It's only stagnant because some episodes are pretty filler.

It gets more interesting when the show gets back into the core storytelling with with main criminal organization.

You can actually follow almost all of the major plotlines of the series if you watch the selected 50 or so core storyline episodes of the series. Maybe 70-80 if you want more crucial insight into some characters. Maybe more on top if you like a specific character and want to see their character centric episodes.

But you don't really have to task yourself to watch each and every episode. It's really not the kind of show that one needs to watch as a completionist, because so many of its episodes are standalone cases. 


>> ARTICLE
A lot of people are complaining about the fillers, but you have to admit it's damn impressive create around 800 unique murder mysteries of fillers.
>> ARTICLE
The filler can get pretty bad sometimes but some arcs are really good, like the Clash of Red and Black arc around episode 500, the recent Mystery Train (episode 700-ish), and every episode with Heiji Hattori or Kaito Kid. Episode 345 and the Desperate Revival arc (episode 200-ish) are my personal favourites.

^^^someone ^^^save ^^^me

EDIT: In all seriousness though, the best way to watch the show is to watch all the character introduction episodes, then just watch the Black Organization, Hattori Heiji, and Kaito Kid episodes, which cuts down the episode count to about a hundred. The Detective Conan wiki has a comprehensive list of what episodes to watch, which is great- back when I was a kid, I had to watch all five hundred episodes *twice* because I forgot which ones were the good ones!



>> ARTICLE
Kaito Kid vs. Conan is my jam.
>> ARTICLE
It's not an anime where you really need to watch the whole thing. I think it's worth seeing a few episodes, because it's a culturally significant anime and it's enjoyable. I haven't seen more than 25 or so episodes, myself. I don't regret the time I invested in those episodes, but I'm probably not going to get back into it either.  
  
Fun mysteries with cool solutions, but so many of them.
>> ARTICLE
I remember watching one episode as a kid, it was pretty entertaining. I just don't like watching bits and pieces of things, if I'm watching an anime it's staying on my radar.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is that if you just follow the main plotline episodes, you basically are getting the 'whole' thing more or less. There's some character elaborations in other episodes, but it's not something you won't pick up on watching only the most critical episodes. The status quo of the characters don't wildly change in this series except in those core episodes.
>> ARTICLE
The first couple hundred episodes are a little slow, but season 29 really makes it all worthwhile 
>> ARTICLE
**One Piece,** I'm not a big fan of 100+ episode shows.

Perhaps they're not too great of reasons \\_()_/

School Days is kind of special because it's not really meant to be a 'proper' harem show. It's 'bad end' the anime.

TWGOK and Noucome are entertaining. 
>> ARTICLE
[The World God Only Knows](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8525/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai) is fantastic and definitely worth a watch, with the sequels getting better with each one.

Another one that's great is [Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28677/Yamada-kun_to_7-nin_no_Majo_%28TV%29), although the adaptation cuts A LOT of content from the manga from what I understand.


>> ARTICLE
I just finished TWGOK up to season 2, and by the time I was done, I could proudly declare myself a fan of the series. Like, seriously, I don't watch Harem shows and I hate poorly developed romance, but as far as this show goes it's more like "Sherlock Homes: Anime Harem Edition".

It even has a character playing the role of a Watson, for the MC to explain things to.

I found it way too dark and depressing. Watching it made me feel horrible. So yeah, the reason why I couldn't continue watching the show is because I am a bit of a pansy.

If you feel it's too dark after 2 episodes then it's probably a good idea to drop it. Gets waaaay more depressing later on

To be fair for the show, [massive spoilers](/s " The characters largely get out of it alive. There's some losses for sure and some evil things that do happen, but the characters ultimately fight on, win the day and have a future to look forward to")

Ah, well...it doesn't get any happier from there...but most that do drop it seem to drop it for 2 reasons, those being the MC (Shu) and the Antagonist (Hamdo) for both being over the top characters that don't fit the show that well. But aside from that I really liked it...but then again I'm kind of a fan of very dark stuff...and can tell you if you didn't like the direction it was going for how dark it was going to be, you dropped it for the right reason.

Fate: Stay Night and Zero.

UBW is definitely not worth an inordinate amount of hype, but it's still a solid show. Haven't watched Zero, so I can't make mention of that, but UBW is, in my eyes, just a 7/10, no more or less. Ending isn't proper since the films aren't here yet, but hey, they knew they were making the films anyways.
>> ARTICLE
Man I totally agree, so many suggestions turn out to be just ok. That said, having seen both, they are entertaining for the action scenes and for the lore of the story if that intrigues you. The actual characters fall flat most of the time, and tbh I hated kiritsugu and kirei as the main characters of fate/zero.

seriously though, it is way too hyped up. I went into it expecting the greatest anime like ever, and was severely disappointed at the lacklustre show that I had seen.

When I joined this sub the fate/zero hype was arguably much more prevalent wide spread and upvoted both on r/anime and r/animesuggest
And despite that  hype I watched it and I loved it I have seen 50+ more series since then and it's still my favorite show of all time. The only other show that was more hyped for me than f/z was fma:b and although it didn't top my list I still enjoyed it immensely. seriously you shouldn't let the hype or hate for a series deprive you of experiencing a great show.

I won't say I'm refusing to watch it (because it does look good)...but every day it gets lower on my list of Plan to Watch: [**Death Note**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note). As of recent, I've been watching more and more series less mentioned on /r/anime or I don't hear too many opinions on, which Death Note definitely being the most popular...so it gets lower on my list of too watch. I know, it's a dumb reason, but after over 9 years of hearing what's good, bad, alright, or mediocre about it and being spoiled to hell with it, I keep losing interest in seeing it...
>> ARTICLE
Interesting perspective. While I'm impressed Death Note has enjoyed huge staying power since the first time I read the manga years ago, it's impact has certainly diminished.

DN came at a time when teens (including myself) were reading mainly DBZ, Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. It was an incredible fresh burst of originality.

Since then there have been other anime with better characters and better exploration of similar themes. However, the attractiveness of the premise still can't be trumped.

One Piece, Naruto, Bleach.

I just don't think that it's possible for a show to keep up quality for such a duration. I get that some people like filler but I don't. To me if a show isn't on average 9/10 then it probably isn't worth watching because there are so many good shows out there.

>> ARTICLE
Aw. I love Prince of Tennis. The enjoyable thing about TeniPuri is really the characters, so I don't think a movie would be a good introduction to it (no time to introduce everyone).  
  
To me, things like Haikyuu and Yowapeda are good, but ultimately inferior versions of TeniPuri. The animation is better, but they lack a certain je ne sais quoi.
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps!
>> ARTICLE
If you want a tighter tennis anime, follow Baby Steps. It has a far more realistic take on the sport and the pacing is a lot better and more concise to the sport. Prince of Tennis is like a shonen fighting manga more than a sports anime. It really takes a supernatural twist on the tennis sport. Baby Steps is a lot more grounded and the plot progression feels more convincing.

I wouldn't go so far as to say I "won't" watch these but I'd really need to be convinced in order to.

Plastic Memories: Because my friend told me the basic concept (giftias, romance, bla) and I can *already* predict the ending. It doesn't sound like my type of thing at all. Nothing against the show, this is really more of an inconvenient personal taste than a "that sounds awful" thing.

Madoka Magicka: Sorry, this is mostly /r/anime 's fault. I watched YuYuYu a while back not knowing anything about it. It easily became one of my favorites. So anyways, everyone talks about Madoka here, which is cool and all... but apparently YuYuYu's considered the "same thing" ... then I heard that it has a "worse ending" ? I loved YuYuYu's ending. I also loved its art style, meanwhile the weird faces in PMMM throw me off. Again though, this is more of a compliment to PMMM than anything else. It must be good if you guys consider it better than one of my favorites. I just have too much that I assume would subjectively hurt my experience.

Neon Genesis Evangelion: I have 2 best friends. The first one watched it and hated it. The second one watched it, bought it, let me borrow it, then watched the movies and decided to take his DVD back from me on the basis that I "should just watch Rebuild instead of watching Shinji get increasingly sad." I had seen 8 or 9 episodes and enjoyed them at this point, but admittedly, I don't usually appreciate depressing stuff. Sad anime is fantastic, but the line between sad and depressing can be weird. I trust my friends' opinions on it enough at this point to have the show not pique my interest.

Most ecchi shows: I'm definitely not the target audience.

If anyone wants to try to sell me on one of these, please try. I don't want to miss out on seriously enjoying something!
>> ARTICLE
Madoka magica is pretty depressing. The story and execution is great, but maybe you should give it a miss if you don't like depressing stuff. I haven't watched YuYuYu so I can't make comparisons.

Personally, I thought the depressing themes in NGE were horribly overdone, like to the point where they aren't really depressing anymore. A lot of people seem to really like it though, so I don't know.

>> ARTICLE
> The story and execution is great, but maybe you should give it a miss if you don't like depressing stuff.

I feel like if the story and execution is great then it wouldn't come off as "depressing" at least to the viewer. I guess depressing might not be the best word here. I'm thinking more along the lines of watching it and feeling bad rather than being hyped for the next episode or whatever.

From what I've heard about Madoka, this is probably the main reason why I assume that my personal preferences would leave me ultimately finding YuYuYu the more enjoyable show.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Madoka.

It's not depressing but deep, very deep, and the ending is positive not negative.

>> ARTICLE
For Plastic Memories - the show never really tries to hide the ending. It's known from the start. It's a show as tries to make the viewer watch how the ending should be handled (weird wording, but I can't think of a non spoiler way to describe it).
>> ARTICLE
While it is depressing for a large part of the show, the ending(End Of Evangelion, not the last 2 episodes of the series.) is a spectacular cinematic masterpiece that should be witnessed by anyone that can see and hear. The ending is so beautiful despite its sad and catastrophic implications. I'll even go as far to say that the final scene, though extremely fucked up in a way, was cute. A true human experience. 10/10.

Madoka is like Coke. YuYuYu is RC Cola.
>> ARTICLE
If you could explain why that would be a lot more helpful...

I'm really not doubting at all that Madoka is fantastic. It's just that I watched YuYuYu without really hearing about it at all, then finding out that all everyone ever talks about is some show that's similar but "better." The only time I've ever heard arguments for it here seem like things that I subjectively wouldn't enjoy as much. Meanwhile if I talk to someone who seems to look for similar things in shows that I do... they say that YuYuYu is better (they watched Madoka first btw)
>> ARTICLE
Without getting to the whole "Madoka did it first" territory, I have the following reasons for liking Madokes better than YuYuYu. First of all, you said that the art is a factor that's making it unwathable for you. Character design aside, which may be a hit or miss to most, Shaft did a marvelous job in creating atmosphere. The witch labyrinths by Gekidan Inu Curry conveyed a unique feeling of danger and distress. Yuki Kajiura's magnificent musical score is another major factor that contributes to why this show is considered a masterpiece. I personally consider the OST to be her magnum opus. Production-wise, almost every single element in the show served a purpose. Plot-wise, I felt like YuYuYu may have dragged on a bit too much in the middle. Some people might have liked it, but I thought that the onsen ep was a waste of time. Madoka stayed consistent for me in that every episode had something significant to contribute to the bigger picture. I just felt that the story was better paced overall. As for that controversial ending, the one that people are actually complaining about is the ending of the third movie, Rebellion. And these people are probably complaining because they already lived through and loved the original series. It really was a love it or hate it ending. But opinion's pretty consistent when it comes to the main series ending, which is quite favorable for the most part. If you don't mind me being quite frank, YuYuYu's ending left a bad taste in my mouth. The one thing I would commend YuYuYu for, however, are the fight scenes. It's a bit hard really to explain what makes Madoka Madoka without having the person experience it for himself. I really do recommend forcing your way through it because there's only so much I can say in words. It's just 12 eps after all. I hope that helps.

Edit: I didn't directly explain the comparison. Sorry, typing this on my mobile after a long day of work. I hope you can at least infer it from that. It's honestly unfair to compare these shows. The similarity ends in them being in the same genre, being under the cola category in that simile, hence the Coke and RC thing. Other than that, they're just not the same. Any other concerns? I'd be willing to answer to get another person to watch one of my favorite shows of all time.

> Plot-wise, I felt like YuYuYu may have dragged on a bit too much in the middle. Some people might have liked it

I'm one of the people who thought YuYuYu's middle was the best part (like episode 7 or 8 I think it was?), and overall loved the pacing, direction, and ending. So when I hear that the majority finds Madoka better, that just makes me assume that I'm in the minority.

What you said about Madoka's consistency is encouraging though. Things serving a purpose and et cetera makes me think that even though I'd still prefer something else, Madoka would at least be quite enjoyable.

I'll probably get around to watching it eventually, if not only because I notice it mentioned in every other thread here. It's just that right now I don't see myself getting as much out of it as I would something completely new to me.

Thank you.

 PMMM's ending is up there with Code Geass R2's ending, there's nothing fair about comparing YuYuYu's ending with it

Watching Madoka Magica first completely ruined my chances of enjoying YuYuYu, honestly. There's no other show from any other genre that does that. There's a chance that, once I get around to it, I might be able to enjoy Cardcaptor Sakura, but I'm really not expecting anything other than further disappointment

As for NGE, I'd form your own opinion on it, and keep watching. Its just a show, when you get right down to it, its not as if you can't just stop if things are going south too quick on you. And either way, the Rebuilds assume you've watched most of the series, at least the first 20 episodes if I recall correctly, so you're shooting yourself in the foot if you go that route (I'm saying the movies skim over and basically recap the majority of the NGE tv series)
>> ARTICLE
Plastic Memories is a the slowest train wreck you've ever seen happening. Right from the very first episode it's very obvious how the series is going to end, in what has to be the most blatant setup possible.

It then spends the rest of the series marching towards the ending you know is going to happen and makes you hate yourself for getting attached to the characters despite knowing exactly how it all will end, all the while doing some phenomenal world-building and miniature arcs involving other Giftias the main characters have to retrieve.
>> ARTICLE
> phenomenal world-building and miniature arcs

In a romcom? This makes it sound really interesting, but I'm not sure, it also kind of makes it sound like wasted potential.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was actually surprised by it. It's not the generic romcom bull you find in most anime of the sort, it actually takes the concept of the Giftias and completely runs with it, exploring several moral questions surrounding the practice and the emotional impact it can have on the people who use them.

While it does have moments with gag comedy and uses some fairly standard anime tropes to get the plot going, once it does it develops into something surprisingly human and well written.

More importantly though, is the world-building: By the time you're done with the show, you know pretty much everything about how the Giftias function and what happens if things go awry. They fully explore the potential of the concept and do so with aplomb.

It's definitely a sad anime, but it's also got a surprising amount of hope in it as well. To be honest, it's definitely a series I'd recommend to people in the future... Outside of the second half of Unlimited Blade Works, I'd easily call it the most solid title of the Spring 2015 season.
>> ARTICLE
Usagi Drop because I was spoiled on the other half of the source material that wasn't adapted into the anime. I feel like I *would* definitely enjoy it, but in the back of my head, I would be thinking about what happens afterwards. 
>> ARTICLE
I too got spoiled. Instead it was when I was half way finished it and was due to me just google image searching Rin. Even with the manga end in my head it didn't stop me from enjoying the anime. Some people like to treat the manga and anime as seperate universes. It might help in your case.
>> ARTICLE
I was also spoiled, but I have enjoyed Usagi Drop a lot. Give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
I don't like sad endings or too much drama in general.  I get terrible depressed when I watch series like that. So series like Your Lie in April, AnoHana, and White Album 2 are pretty much off the table for me.
>> ARTICLE
**Death Note**, because it's funny telling people that I've watched over 107 days worth of anime, but I haven't seen the most popular anime in the west. Same goes for **Code Geass**.
>> ARTICLE
Don't be scared of your emotions, let em out. If an anime can make you cry, or think outside your normal box, that's pretty damn special. Part of growing older is to come to terms with this shit, you know?
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass.  I REALLY dislike the animation style and character designs.

Also most anime like Naruto, Dragonball Z, Bleach, One Piece, etc. I will refuse to watch since I just don't like that kind of anime in general.  I saw like two episodes of Naruto a long time ago and it turned me away from anime for a long time until Hellsing and Ghost in the Shell brought me back.
>> ARTICLE
PREVIOUSLY it was Steins;Gate because I'd watched up to episode eight or so and was wondering how I could be a third through the show with what felt like no plot progression at all.

I finally finished it past those first eight in this last week or so because I trusted that there was more beneath the surface, and it was great! LIKE WOW GREAT. As in I'm-downloading-the-movie-right-now great.
>> ARTICLE
Case Closed. Way too far along for me, and I mean how many cases can they solve before they start recycling ideas? Seriously it would take me forever to catch up and I know at some point I'm just gonna get bored. 
>> ARTICLE
Naruto and One Piece, because the people who I know that like those shows are all really annoying and won't shut up about said shows whenever you talk with em about animu.
>> ARTICLE
That's a shame, they're really good in my opinion. But it'd reasonable why you wouldn't want to watch it
>> ARTICLE
To be fair I wanted to give One Piece an honest shot at one point but some people ruin the fun of it, I was never really big in to anime untill recently, I only watched the main stream things, but I'm also rather secretive about watching it now, mainly due to the people at my uni who watch Anime are insufferable people who are annoying on a whole new level.
>> ARTICLE
You really should watch it, the story is great and it only gets better as you go on
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend you to read the manga. The anime is terrible in comparison, it can't do it justice. Plus, if the subject ever comes up when dealing with those people, you can safely say "no, haven't ever watched it" and be correct.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much art and character design I dislike straight right off the bat.  Code Geass, Gundam Seed, Clannad,
>> ARTICLE
Nyaruko-san. I know it has a fuckton of references, and my way to deal with it has been just putting every new thing that gets added to my PTW list over it. So I'll probably never watch it.

On the other hand, harems. I hate the fundamental concept of a harem, plus I've never seen a good one.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece because it's so damn long ...
>> ARTICLE
Grave of the fireflies because everyone only seems to remember it for the amount of tears they had to shed. I don't like the idea of watching a movie that's just a tearjerker, other shows evoke emotions as well without the need to squeeze the lachrymal gland so hard.
>> ARTICLE
Dead Leaves
>> ARTICLE
I had to drop Highschool DxD S2 because it was ecchi overload. S1 was okay because it was like a normal ecchi. S2 was borderline hentai (the angles in the Akeno finger healing scene).

That doesn't mean I'll avoid the anime forever. (   )
>> ARTICLE
HxH, just bothers me to have kids so young as protagonists. This contributed to me not enjoying Evangelion nearly as much as well.

And yes I'm aware, these two shows are worshipped. It's very hard not to notice.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad and anohana. I've been way to emotional in scenes that shouldn't even have that much effect. If i watch clannad or anohana, i'll lose my man-card D:
>> ARTICLE
As I said to another person earlier in this thread...I really recommend you reconsider. The story, characters, and writing of Clannad and Clannad: After Story are superb. I've watched the whole thing about 5-6 times now over the years and enjoy myself every watch through. Definitely my favorite anime currently, and doubt something will replace it anytime soon.

Will you cry? Your damn right you will, but it's worth every tear.
>> ARTICLE
Well manly tears will be shed... I cannot even hear that gosh darn Dango song without tearing up... Clannad is definitely a beautiful anime.
>> ARTICLE
Watch them alone, late at night, where noone will see you. It's healthy to cry. You gotta lube those tear ducts, just like an oil change for your car, right?
>> ARTICLE
I actually watched Clannad because everyone said it was insanely sad. and in the end I didn't even shed a tear. Decent shows minus the ending though.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad got me a little, but After Story really hit me. It all depends on where your head is at. I've never had a show hit me like that, but i'm a parent, and that shit changes some peoples emotional dynamics.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I can see that getting you as a parent. It may of been that I was going into it expecting it to be sad and was more steeled than usual or something. I know the final episode of code geass somehow managed to get me.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah same, I was pretty dry through all of Code Geass, but the ending was surprisingly strong.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still not even sure why I cried there. At some point I just realized that I was crying.
>> ARTICLE
Probably the manliest answer i could wish for. <3
>> ARTICLE
what the hell is a "man-card"?
>> ARTICLE
One result of a misguided belief in traditional gender norms.
>> ARTICLE
It's a joke dude... I don't care if i cry or not. I'm open about it(obviously). I just want to save those two anime, particularly to watch with somebody :)
>> ARTICLE
> It's a joke dude

But you're perpetuating the stereotype, which leads to the continued neglect of emotional welfare among the general population.
>> ARTICLE
And how am i doing that exactly? Any guy with a mature way of thinking will understand the joke. And from what i can tell a lot of people here are mature and clever. Theres also a plethora of "you aren't a man if you don't cry" jokes out there to even out one mans joke.
>> ARTICLE
Making a joke about a stereotype is still utilizing the stereotype. It's akin to a racist joke, only the idea of "men aren't allowed to cry" is much more socially acceptable to laugh about.
>> ARTICLE
you know, I really can see where you are coming from, probably more than most people here, but still, being too painfully serious about light-hearted or even stupid jokes with unclear or harmless intent won't take you anywhere. Particularly on reddit.

And drawing racism card isn't gonna help the case either.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're taking things way to seriously. Nobody would take my comment seriously ever, except you. Think about it dude. I was talking about my own mental stability. I am a very emotional person but do not really care myself, i share it with a few of my close friends. Bro's and Bro-ets. But as somebody that cried when watching angel beats, i think at this moment watching these two anime would be too much for me.
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion, I remember watching it when I was younger and some of the scenes were pretty brutal. I'll give it a shot in the future. 
>> ARTICLE
Just do it! *Shia Lebouf voice*
>> ARTICLE
> I'll give it a shot in the future.

Sounds quite a bit different from refusing to watch it.

Probably gonna get slaughtered but the rabid and generally holier than thou fanbase is definitely the biggest reason for me. Along with having a general idea how the story goes because no one shuts up about every plot point and the ending, and the fact I can't stand characters like Shinji, I'll never watch it.
>> ARTICLE
I watched both Eva and Fate before finding out about the rabid, pretentious fan bases.  Haven't felt as much about Eva as Fate that way but I'll admit I would be put off by it too.
>> ARTICLE
I'll never understand not watching an anime because of its perceived fanbase.
>> ARTICLE
I don't either honestly.  
>> ARTICLE
Then if the shows interest you, you should take a look :)
>> ARTICLE
Admit it shinji is a bitch.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, and I'm sure that fourteen year old you would have been nothing but a stalwart hero in the face of constant mortal peril fighting twenty-story-tall monsters with a family life more broken than the windows of a Compton jewelry warehouse and the literal weight of the world hanging on your shoulders like a spindly, pubescent Atlas.

There are negative things about Shinji, but he never reacted in a way that wasn't 100% understandable.
>> ARTICLE
Just because it's understandable doesn't mean it's interesting to watch.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes, too long, old, there's a new series coming (remake or not idk), not fond of that artstyle either, don't want to sit through 110 episodes of 8-bit pew pew...

So what? Is it so bad for an anime to have more than 50 episodes. FMA:B has 64 and is highly praised by almost anyone who's seen it. 
>> ARTICLE
I usually find that most shows over 50 are to long for their own good and quality slips. FMA:B is definitely an acception.

There are a few good 50 episode shows I can think of off the top of my head though. Eureka 7 and Clannad + After Story.

JoJo just because of all the memes posted here I can conclude that it isn't a serious type of anime.

>> ARTICLE
its the most intense anime of all
>> ARTICLE
Psycho Pass. Everyone seems to think it's the best thing ever, but a few very trustworthy sources of mine seem to disagree entirely, and I'd rather listen to people who have been right about a lot of shows, than random circlejerks.
>> ARTICLE
Season 1 was very well done imo. As for season 2, I like to pretend it didn't happen.
>> ARTICLE
I got like 15 Minutes into episode 1 of season 2 and couldn't stand the partner bitch. I dropped it and haven't looked back. I thought Psycho-Pass ended wonderfully, I was surprised they gave it a 2nd season. 
>> ARTICLE
From what's been described to me, for it to work, it would have to be done incredibly well, or not be good enough, and constant monologues sounds like a surefire way to not do it right. I'm not going to watch a deep show if it doesn't do a good job.
