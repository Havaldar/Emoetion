Dio can freeze shit up. Next season : He forgot all about it. Now he has a stand, he can fly and stop the world, he can resurrect people.
>> ARTICLE
I was actually thinking about this recently, he probably can't do the freezing because he did it using perfect body control, since he hasn't fully bonded with his new body, he doesn't have perfect control over it. Flying though, it just makes me wonder why Jotaro spends money on cabs
>> ARTICLE
I... actually have a theory about that.

[Part 5 And Onwards Spoilers](/s "We actually see the flying thing again in Vento Aureo, when Giorno gets Gold Experience Requiem and King Crimson goes to attack him. In this case, both managed -limited- flight. It's also mentioned at some point during the story that the reasons Stand Users are attracted to each other is to push their abilities to grow, so...")

[Part 5 And Onwards Spoilers](/s "My theory is that when Stand Users whose abilities parallel each other become embroiled in a very intense battle, there's some sort of energy boost that starts pushing Stands to the upper limits of their power. When the battle is over, however, that feedback loop ceases and Stands return--roughly--to their base power level.")

Alternatively.

Araki just thinks flying is cool.

His Stardust Incarnation was basically game breakingly powerful with TimeStop, So bringing him to being a mentor is much better from a story point of view so he doesn't dominate the plot.

Plus his story is over. I like the idea of each new JoJo having a previous JoJo watch over them in some fashion though, let's the audience see their character development fully realized.

Did dogs murder Araki's family when he was a kid or what? Every season there seems to be dog murder. :(
>> ARTICLE
He loves dogs. He makes characters kill them because he hates the idea of them being killed and he knows it makes them much easier to hate.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly prefer that to the "all bad guys are rapists" that we see in things like SAO. Angelo's a bad example, though. He's a dog-hating rapist.
>> ARTICLE
I can see it. We only have like an episode and a half to learn to hate this character, so a quick and easy way is to kill cute doggos. And you know, the  dogs owner, and the kids, and Josuke's grandpa, and all those other people. So maybe killing not just killing the dog makes me hate this guy. 
>> ARTICLE
So does that make Kars the most likeable villain?
>> ARTICLE
That was to establish that he considered himself a part of nature in the same way that he pushed himself out of the way when falling so that he wouldn't hit a flower, and despised humans because they are constantly destroying nature. He kills the squirrel later because once he became the ultimate being, he considered himself above nature.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the part where Angelo raped and killed teenagers didn't really sell me that he was a bad guy
>> ARTICLE
Angelo seemed like a good guy but the second he ate the dog's face off you know he is a bad guy!
>> ARTICLE
I, for one, was thinking "Oh man, I really like this villain; I hope he eats a dogs face or something to signify his incoming death". Never in my wildest dreams did I think it wouldn't be a metaphor!
>> ARTICLE
Angelo is a one off character though, I think that was just to let us understand "Hey, this guy is just as fucked up as you think a serial killer/rapist would be." In the manga they made it more of a point to let everyone know he actually REALLY hates dogs. And that him being turned into a rock that dogs piss on all the time made it that much worse for him. But they didn't include that little bit afterwards.

He bit the fucking dog's head off and spit the blood in the owner's mouth. I've seen some weird shit in anime but that was just...bizarre. Then cue the grooviest OP of the season right afterwards in typical Jojo fashion. ED is pretty good too.

In fact, this whole episode was pretty up there in Jojoness. I mean..."*I killed your grandpa but you have no right to kill me*"? And then they turn the rapist into a landmark where lovers meet? Wow.

Also, Josuke too OP, pls nerf. How you just blast a hole in your mom like that?
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if people realise his existence in this landmark (since we see his face) and if he needs food to survive.
>> ARTICLE

I imagine that they will do that in the intro of the next episode as [Jojo Part 4 Manga](#s " He talks about how he got his Stand from one of the Nijimura brothers and afterwards he tried to kill a boy with his stand still in the glove. In response Josuke Doraras him into the Rock in the ED.")

People should REALLY wait before Jumping the Gun.

They did the same thing in the last episode, saying "They cut the backstory of Angelo and the 3 boys!!!" without waiting this episodes.

(Gonna post the same thing I said on the other thread)  
  
This OP kind of actually fits, honestly.  
  
This story isn't about some adventurous anime trip around the world, this is the story of a town with weird shit happening in it. So I'm not really surprised they went with a more happy tune, I suppose that will change once the second season comes but for now its a crazy noisy bizarre town.  
  
Part 4 is the start of a new generation, Parts 1-3 were connected in that way and I see Parts 4-6 as the same way.
  
I do miss the CG though, they hide little hints here and there really well and I wonder if we still get the final episode SFX for the season.
  
  
  
ED was on point tho, I LOVE THE ED.
>> ARTICLE
Savage Garden as the ED was such a nice surprise. 

And while I do like the CG in the other OPs and such I'm honestly okay without it. I like the visuals as they are with the OP and ED. I don't know much about the story (not caught up with manga) but I do agree with what you said - strange things are happening in the town. It's not SC - it's a look at the town and the high schooler dealing with all of it first hand (and Jotaro.)
>> ARTICLE
Savage Garden is a pretty good choice honestly. Love it.
>> ARTICLE
Completely forgot what Angelo did to those boys...

That glove scene. One of the reasons Josuke is my fav JoJo is because he combines Joseph's Cunningness and Jotaro's Balls of Steel. This guy is really creative too. The ability to fix things may not sound strong but the way he uses it MAKES it strong. Reminds me of Caesar from Part 2.


The OP is giving me serious Death Parade vibes, it's groovy as fuck. GREATO DESU YO

[](#misakiteehee)

Dunno if anyone was expecting I Want You as the ED but i like it alot.
>> ARTICLE
> tonio runing on the op

i want to protect that smile. 
>> ARTICLE
I was so happy, I'm surprised Tonio even made it into the OP when it seems like a few other choice people didn't.
>> ARTICLE
So, as you guys saw, as people thought Josuke's Stand was OP on the first episode, we saw today two weaknesses:

1- He can't bring people back from the dead.

2- Josuke can't heal himself using the Stand.

These two rules make Josuke Stand the ultimate medic while still keep it balanced for the series purpose and tension to the fights.

And YES! Savage Garden! I really liked the ED!

Yeah I jumped up and started dancing when I heard Savage Garden at the ending. The 90s teenager in me was happy lol.

[](#concealedexcitement)

If we're going to keep getting battles like this one where mind games and tactics are used I'm going to be happy. 
>> ARTICLE
OP is right, most of the fights from here on out are like that!
>> ARTICLE
Not just Diamond is Unbreakable too, all the future parts are strategic for the vast majority of fights.
>> ARTICLE
Will there still be "not-actually-fights"-fights (sorry, couldn't really express it much better) like against the gambler? That was my favorite part about the changes to stands. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if that's the best way to word it but Josuke often gets caught in dangerous situations outside of fights where he has to come up with a creative use of Crazy Diamond to escape.

Anyways, when it comes to strategic fights, I think Part 4 has the highest level tricks I've seen and I've read Part 5 and some of Part 6. It's quite a fun challenge to think along with the characters(Josuke, Koichi, etc) and try and figure out how they'll win.
>> ARTICLE
Boy are you in for a treat!
>> ARTICLE
Let me tell you that word "fight" is used very loosely from here on out, the battle is won often by doing something else
>> ARTICLE
Part 4 has the best of those, IMO. You're gonna love it.
>> ARTICLE
At least 70% of the fights are Darby level insaneism. 
>> ARTICLE
You have no idea. There are a some really memorable ones in Part 4 alone.
>> ARTICLE
It will continue to be all about brains from here on. I can't really think of a coming fight that was won by pure power. It gets more nuanced as in each fight there are different strengths and weaknesses. I'm so tempted to talk about the next episode for this reason but I also don't want to spoil.

And of the remaining parts I think that part 4 has the most of them (brains over brawns fights), part 7 has my favorite in terms of character development while part 6 has the most brutal one and comes closest to the Darby (the gambler) fight in feeling. 
>> ARTICLE
I just have a vague question but seeing Jotaro and Josuke together I have to assume there's a point in the series where there's a villain fucked up enough that jotaro ORA ORA's the fuck out of him and then josuke vaguely puts him back together again so jotaro can ORA ORA some more. Am I right? I hope I'm right.
>> ARTICLE
I assume that you're seen the Josuke finisher in All star battle.  It will happen, ill say that much but Jotaro is soon going to be relegated to side-line where he fits the best. A guy like him takes up too much space, this is Josukes and moriohs story.

Jotaro is certainly going to play a huge role like a mentor-figure and shock-trooper against particulary nasty stands. So he will not get the Avdol treatment at least.
>> ARTICLE
[Part 4](/s "I'm not saying you're exactly right but I think you'll be more than satisfied.")

>> ARTICLE
I'll just say this: Crazy Diamond's dorarara is just as strong and fast as Star Platinum's oraoraora!
>> ARTICLE
Everyone's saying Part 4 is the "biggest" in that respect, but I imagine most haven't read what we have of Part 8; virtually *every single fight* is strategic mind games, it's incredible.
>> ARTICLE
Part 4 has a ton of those so you're in for a treat. Want me to give some vague examples ?

I like the OP, pretty funky. But I have to admit that unlike the other JoJo EDs so far, I didn't know this one. Seems fitting though. David Production is hellbent on showcasing the pretty boys of this part.

I think I'll resume two of my counters from the rewatch, with an added column on Stand user's fates, considering what happened to Angelo. 

Speaking of Angelo, this is the first glimpse of the crazy concepts Araki had for Part 4. Some Stands have the weirdest properties and limitations, which makes the fights pretty dynamic.  
Actually sounds weird that I'm giving hints on what is to come, since I only started reading Part 4 two weeks ago and finished it yesterday.

**Stand User Fates**

[Stardust Crusaders final tally is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4cspal/rewatchspoilers_jojos_bizarre_adventure_stardust/d1l4657)

Yeah, don't mess with Josuke's family. Or you will create a whole new category of "Retired". =P
>> ARTICLE
That op was funky! A little disappointed it's not in the JoJo cgi, but I think it matches Part 4's tone perfectly. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually kinda shocked that I'm seeing people calling the OP bad because it's not like the other JoJo OPs or not CG, I think it's perfect for Part 4. I really thought it'd be more well received when I first saw it.
>> ARTICLE
B-but it's not JoJo OP without the CGI :'(
>> ARTICLE
The OP and ED fit pretty well for JoJo

That being said it feels underwhelming compared to the other 4 OP/ED's JoJo has had. Even though its purposefully toned down for the sake of thematic continuity it just still feels....... weaker 
>> ARTICLE
I think it fits well and I feel like we will see some changes to it as the series progresses similar to s4 op.
>> ARTICLE
So, in the OP, Koichi didn't have a Stand yet, but he was standing in a ~~interesting~~ JoJo way. Does that mean he gets a Stand as the season progresses, too? The others had their Stands lining up in a parallel with them, so I'm assuming his Stand, if he gets one, will be at the left, forming a V with him. His shadow in the beginning was really strange and wonky as well, maybe it's shadow related, or liquidish?
>> ARTICLE
It feels like if you changed the characters it would fit as a Persona 4 OP, fitting considering how much  P4 seems to have copied JoJo pt 4.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like the OP much, I didn't hate it, just not a fan.

That ED though... holy fuck it's awesome.
>> ARTICLE
it is not "bad" but doesn't feel....jojo and i miss that a lot, the other opening have their particularities but they all feel jojo, i have seen this a fair amount of times and still no feeling it nor it is growing on me...
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed it. Not quite as much as the others, but I'm sure with time it'll be up there.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the OP. An epic end of THE WORLD type song wouldn't have fit this part.
>> ARTICLE
3D openings were awesome, but I like this one better given the whole show's art style. 


>> ARTICLE
I liked it more than any of the other openings 
>> ARTICLE
It's like the OP to a slice of life romcom.  
Perfect fit for Part 4.
>> ARTICLE
The song is still catchy as hell but the CG OPs for all the other JoJo seasons just made them stick out so much. It's still good but it will never have the same impact as something like [this](http://openings.moe/?video=Opening2-JoJo2012.webm) (warning it's probably really loud) although that OP has a nice combo of both regular and CG animation it still way more interesting visually than the new one.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the opening was fabulous!  Very fitting in tone and style.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually surprised at the restraint David Production have shown at this OP.  There's a grand total of 3 Stands that are shown, Star Platinum, Crazy Diamond and The Hand.  Hell, even one of the main character was hidden from the OP.
>> ARTICLE
It's not like the others because Part 4 is not like the others. Part of the reason I like it so much because it's so different. I do sorta miss the CG visuals, but what's important is that I get to see more JoJo.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this might not be the final version of the OP sequence. Manga readers will see what's obviously missing from it so I'm wondering if they might switch to CG after [kind of spoilers I guess](/s "they've finished the SoL part of this arc and get into the real stuff"), cause otherwise there would be obvious spoilers galore in the OP right now.  
Maybe all that stuff will happen in a later season even and we'll get a new OP that will fit better with the later stuff.
>> ARTICLE
[some more spoilers concerning the OP](/s "I think they might add the stands of the other characters. They will definitely add Koichi's Echoes, as it was pretty obviously missing during the sequence with Josuke, him and Okuyasu")
>> ARTICLE
I thought the OP was incredibly fun, which certainly fits the tone of Part 4. People will learn to love it. Personally, I can't get enough!
>> ARTICLE
Its funky. I like it. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it'll grow on people once they realize Part 4 is more SoL than the previous parts
>> ARTICLE
I for one loved it. OP and ED both blew me away.
>> ARTICLE
The ED was so awesome, might be a close second or my favorite of the entire series.
>> ARTICLE
The OP will grow on everyone, i for one thought it was prefect as well for part 4.
>> ARTICLE
It will grow on us. People said the same about End of the world.
>> ARTICLE
Literally first episode was people whining that the OP4 was "lacking" or "didn't fit". I like the new OP a lot, maybe not my favorite but that's only because I saw the other ones countless times and I'm obviously biased.
>> ARTICLE
People don't like change. I'm glad it's not like the others. 
>> ARTICLE
It fits but I'm a little disappointed it wasn't at least CG. I love watching those CG OPs because they were unique. At least the song is good though.
>> ARTICLE
The new OP is still pretty damn unique though. It's not like we're getting the usual "Camera pans to sky, birds fly by and we see our main characters running towards something" type of OP.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's still good to watch. But the first 4 OP's are the rare ones that are CG and it was a JoJo only thing (at least of what I've seen). The OP isn't a cut and paste one that every other show has but for me, it's lost something that only JoJo had. I'm probably going to grow to love it as I've done with the other OPs anyway.

###**Part 4**

* Josuke's Stand, Crazy Diamond (called "Shining Diamond" in the Crunchyroll subs) is named after the Pink Floyd song, *Shine On You Crazy Diamond*.

* Anjuro "Angelo" Katagiri's nickname comes from *Angelo Badalamenti*, a composer for Twin Peaks.

* Angelo's stand's name is *Aqua Necklace*. It's unknown what exactly this is referencing, but it might be the album *Aqua* by Asia.

**Reference Count: 3**

Hello everyone, from now on I will be posting this comment in every Jojo discussion thread.  /u/Joestar_

#For Newcomers and non-manga readers:

Feel free to discuss the events of the episode and your conclusions/speculations below (though bear in mind to spoiler tag predictions). It doesn't have to be serious. I will personally try to respond to everyone given that I'm a newcomer myself.

I will not be forcing anyone to participate in this, I'm only seeking to create a safe zone for newcomers to discuss in without external influence. If this idea gains traction, I will continue doing it for the remainder of the season.

Manga readers, if you must participate, please refrain from confirming or denying anything to come. We're all here because we're hyped, no need to sell us on Part 4 after we watched 3 of them.

Also, due to Jojo's air time, I can usually catch it about an hour afterwards, but I'll be posting this the moment the thread comes out.

That being said, let loose!
>> ARTICLE
No music references yet other than Crazy Diamond.

It's not JoJo without copyrighted music references.

As for predictions, I'm betting that Koichi will be useless for a while until he gets a stand out of the blue or something. Unless he just wants to be Speedwagon 3.0.

EVEN KOICHI IS AFRAID!!
>> ARTICLE
Felt really nice. It is more fast-paced than Part 3 and the fight is thrilling all the time. There are some parts that seemed weak to me in this episode, but the overall impression is that I saw a very good second chapter.

>> ARTICLE
I'm scared it's going to go down the route of SC part 1 but in a worse way.

SC 1 was brutal for me at times since it was just pointless battles. This part seems to have less of an overall goal so if they spend times on random stands that don't have an impact I'll be a bit let down. I've got faith that it'll be fun just hope it's not the same feeling as the majority of SC.

[](#yuishrug "Please don't downvote me too much :s")

>> ARTICLE
Quite similar to my feelings.

The main difference for me is that I really like Josuke. It's possible that, much like Jotaro, he can carry the part for me.
>> ARTICLE
During part 3 I wanted more Joseph but had to settle for Jotaro. Now I want more Jotaro but looks like I'm going to have to settle for Josuke :/

I just wanted more screen time for the mom but she's getting like less than Holly ;.;
>> ARTICLE
As far as Holly goes, they've already established her personality well enough. I don't think she will be sidelined. Though you can never tell with Jojo (dat Kakyoin hiatus).

Josuke to me feels like an idealized version of Jotaro's rule of cool.

Jotaro was just deadpan cool, but Josuke has a bit more of a colorful personality yet still is quite cool.
>> ARTICLE
I need to see more of Josuke before I really judge but he hasn't done too much for me to really care for him yet. Maybe one of the new crew will become the new PolPol and everything will be fine but we'll see!
>> ARTICLE
>PolPol

Oh hey... Someone else calls him PolPol! Yay!

I'm actually wondering if Joseph will make an appearance this part. He's not dead. And I assume this matter ties directly to him. He might make a cameo at some point
>> ARTICLE
> During part 3 I wanted more Joseph but had to settle for Jotaro. Now I want more Jotaro but looks like I'm going to have to settle for Josuke :/

Looks like Araki has a specific rule that the Previous Jojo should never outshine the new one, as we both saw in Part 3 and now in Part 4.

Part 2 didn't had this "problem" because Jonathan died, so Joseph didn't had to compete with him for the Spotlight.
>> ARTICLE
unlike SC, pretty much all supporting characters of DiU are amazing and I think that's the main reason I enjoyed it as much as I did while reading it.
>> ARTICLE
Part 4 is a lot more aimless than any of the other parts in the series, but the trade off is that you get some really great characters, also the main villain of part 4 is imo the best in the entire series.
>> ARTICLE
Really I hope I like the characters then!
>> ARTICLE
I still don't understand how Araki manages to write a main villain with almost no real redeeming qualities whatsoever and still managed to make him completely loveable.
>> ARTICLE
Here is Araki's reasoning as to why he likes Part 4's villain. Spoilers obviously.

>> ARTICLE
Pretty hype episode. I didn't think we'd get a significant character death this soon and seeing how both Josuke and Jotaro handled the situation makes me really excited to see how their dynamic will grow throughout the season. 

I thought Angelo was going to be the big bad but seeing him get taken out so handedly makes me think we'll get a lot more crafty villains instead of another DIO. 

Also really loving Josuke's personality and his stand's power. Can't wait to see more of everything!

This is a great idea.

The OP was pretty cool and funky, it was a little more mellow then the previous ones, which seems to fit the art style of this part, and it was still cool. I can't wait until I start getting the references in the little details I haven't even noticed yet. Also really excited to meet the new characters that popped up in the OP.

The episode itself was great. Angelo was an extremely effective creepy villain. The part were he bites the dog to spit it's blood in the owner's mouth was horrifying, and Jotaro's narration of his past crime was equally effective. The fight was also pretty cool with all the water vapour, through it seemed a little short and easy for the build up. Guess the next few arcs will start to introduce the overarching plot.

The weird scene transitions are really cool. I also like that they're still doing the DBZ style power-up aura from the DIO fight (are they in the manga?).

I liked the ending disappointed it wasn't All-star like I heard some people say it might be, there's probably going to be another opening and ending if this part is similar length to part 3.

>> ARTICLE
> Also really excited to meet the new characters that popped up in the OP

Same here... They showed at least 2 other guys besides Josuke who appear to have stands. I doubt we'll get something similar to the Stardust Crusaders, but we might have a nice team on our hands.

>The part were he bites the dog to spit it's blood in the owner's mouth was horrifying

I hate Araki and his penchant for killing dogs. Never fails to rile me up.

>I liked the ending disappointed it wasn't All-star like I heard some people say it might be

I've always found the beauty of Jojo endings is in how they wrap up the atmosphere of the episode, so for now I'll withhold judgment.

Dare I hope for amazing transitions like in Part 1...
>> ARTICLE
> The weird scene transitions are really cool. I also like that they're still doing the DBZ style power-up aura from the DIO fight (are they in the manga?).

Yeah, Araki did auras here and there throughout early Jojo's to signify power (the very first OP is actually a really good example, they gave Jonathan a Hamon aura which happened like once or twice in the manga and almost never in the anime.)

He pretty much constantly drew DIO with an aura in the final fight to signify his power and he sometimes gave one to Jotaro too once it was established that they had "the same type of Stand" Then when Part 4 hit, he started doing auras a lot more. I think the anime handled it well: DIO's aura is a bit weird at first, but it really does make it easier to accept the Part 4 auras.
>> ARTICLE
From watching the OP, i get the feeling that [Koichi](/s "will play an important role in the series, maybe somehow getting a Stand of his own? He made a pose which Jouske and some other dude were making, and those two had stands appear, but Koichi didn't.") I blame the 'What's in an OP?" series from Mother's Basement for making me analyze the OP in such detail.

It's interesting to see Jotaro take on the mentor role this time around, since after his adventures to/during Egypt he's seen it all. His saying that "who would've guessed that a water based stand could be so dangerous" (paraphrased) might be a reference to how the aquatic stand near the start of Stardust Crusaders was a pretty tame villain.

I can tell already that Part 4 is going to turn the "creative and unique uses for stand powers" up to 11, especially with Jouske's ability to heal, and from what we've seen in this episode, fuse objects together. 

>> ARTICLE
I hope this gets traction. I think this is a really cool idea.

How did you guys feel about the pacing here? As a manga reader it seemed fine, but what about from a different perspective? For reference, Part 3 usually did 3 chapters per episode, and this episode was 5.
>> ARTICLE
I'm re-reading part 4 and decided to actually count the chapters in the episode and thought "damn, that was like 4 chapters" The great thing is, it didn't feel rushed at all though.
>> ARTICLE
Insofar there are no comments. :/

I'm still watching the episode right now. I never had any expectations from the part's pacing ever since I was told it was an SoL part. Also, I personally don't care much for pacing issues.

I do hope this grows into something more, but frankly, I'm not too optimistic. Karma speaks loud on reddit.

Wait until people watch it.

Yep. I'm very happy with this turn out, this concept will go on for the rest of the season.
>> ARTICLE
I remember how long this part was in the manga, and I was surprised at how quickly they blew through it in the anime. But it didn't feel rushed at all, and I can't pinpoint anything missing.

All in all I think they did a great job. Really looking forward to later encounters. 
>> ARTICLE
> How did you guys feel about the pacing here?

I thought it was perfect. This episode felt like it went by in no time at all but it still kept very important details like Jotaro comforting Joskue and the after effects of the funeral. Can confirm, hype is still unbreakable. 
>> ARTICLE
Woah, 5 chapters?! Dude, that shit was **Smooth**. That was like part 1 levels of excellent pacing right there.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Part 1 was also 5 chapters per episode. So that would explain that.
>> ARTICLE
It seemed good to me. Stardust felt really slow at first, so what I've seen these last two episodes and heard about more chapters per episode sounds like it could work really well in comparison.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it's still really early, but it seems like David might have learned from some mistakes they made in Part 3 regarding pacing. I've seen a lot of criticism for some of 2 parters really not needing to be 2 parts, and it looks like they've realized that and are only doing 2 parters where it's appropriate, like next episode, which said Part 1.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was 5 chapters??? It was super smooth to me, didn't feel all that rushed. I got the impression that Angelo would be a big bad for a nice chunk of the season and then they took him out pretty quick after all that buildup. But I thought that was the joke, with JJBA being known for that.

I really liked it. One of the strongest starts to all of the JoJo parts we've seen before it. Jotaro still feels like the true star to me even if he's just a supporting character now. I want him to get more air time so Josuke and Jotaro can be like a mystery detective, stand-fighting duo. Like good cop/bad cop, only one cop is the rudest guy on the planet and super serious and the other is bipolar and ready to explode at any time.


Angelo seems like a real jackass, got what he deserved.


Really, just the general atmosphere of the show seems very promising so far. Visuals and the OP/ED were really good.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. I was unsure what to think after I heard it's an SoL Jojo set in one town, but this start has bee quite promising.

I just hope they don't sink to Part 3's repetitive stand battle theme. 
>> ARTICLE
Indeed. It got a AWESOME start. To be honest, I find this battle more intertaining in the ANIME than was in the manga.

You see, let's compare the first Stand User fight of Part 3, which was Kakyoin, to Angelo.

It was more of a direct fight between him and Jotaro, where in Angelo case was a unique fight based on the concept of a Stand that can turn into any kind of liquid, that the heroes needed to find a way to beat it, without things getting to stale like some Part 3 Puzzle Stands.

So the first battle was already really promissing for this new Part in comparation to Part 3. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah... I did mention elsewhere that only Part 2 had a better start and that was entirely thanks to Joseph's grenade+machingun combo
>> ARTICLE
This episode was great and has given me really high hopes for the rest of the series! It was so intense despite being only the second episode and highlighted JoJo's series' strengths; tactical battles rather than straight power bouts. I was shocked though because from episode one I was under the assumption that Angelo would be the main villain for the entire series but he's already finished by episode 2 (unless he comes back later on which I'm doubtful of seeing how he's a tourist attraction). I'm interested to see how they will introduce the major antagonist as well as how the stands will be this series because Angelo's stand was a combination of Kakyoin's and N'Doul's and was used pretty creatively. The best part for me was that Jotaro didn't completely wreck shit. Seeing as he can control time I was really interested to see how they would be able to make the villains in the series a match for him at all but that's one way already been demonstrated to us. I hope Joseph makes an appearance at some point but I'm wondering what will happen with him and Josuke's mother. Maybe she'll fall for Jotaro or he falls for her; the Joestar line's got to continue some how hahaha. All in all there's a ton of potential to be accessed here so I'm hyped to see how the story progresses!
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how was the dialog between Joseph and Tomoko:

**Tomoko:** "Joseph... I need to tell you... I'm pregnant..."

**Joseph:** "Oh! err.... don't worry, I, Joseph Joestar, got the perfect plan for this situation!"

**Tomoko:** "Oh, what is?"

**Joseph:** "NIGERU DAYOOOOOO!!!"

So, um, what the hell are they going to do with the stand?

Ouch...RIP gramps. I was starting to like him. He didn't deserve such a cheap death. Well, you've done it, Jojo. I hate Angelo already. It seems like they're building up Josuke as the protector of the town, implying that Angelo might not be the final boss, or maybe not a boss at all. On that note, STOP KILLING POOR INNOCENT DOGS, ARAKI!!

Welp, RIP Angelo.

Josuke is quite solid so far. He knows his strengths and weaknesses well enough. Jotaro isn't being half the character I thought he would be and I feel this will be a thing for the rest of the season.

I hope to see more of Mama Jojo, though. Her character is interesting.

>> ARTICLE
This is cool.

A fun episode, everything looks kind of different, the setting and the art style, but it is still very much undeniably Jojo. It's impressive how the series can keep evolving, while staying very true to itself. Hopefully that will continue to be the case.

At the minute it's hard to tell how the series will continue. I imagine the format will be similar to part 3, with different stands introduced every 1-3 episodes but it appears it will all be based in the city, which could be pretty fun.

Also I like Josuke, despite not being a big sexy muscly man he's still a badass!
>> ARTICLE
>despite not being a big sexy muscly man he's still a badass!

Exactly my view of him. The only thing that stands out is his hair, and that's quite tame compared to how weird some other Jojo characters are. He has potential to beat Joseph as my favorite Jojo of the series.

We'll see how it goes.
>> ARTICLE
Holy damn this episode!

First of all the OP! I got told that part 4 introduces "a new kind of JoJo". I saw that in the art already and now I see it in the OP as well. Personally I think it fits absolutely perfectly to this colorful funky art style and feeling this part has.

I thought we were over the obligatory PETA scene for the season but JoJo proved me wrong once again, kinda dropped my jaw to be honest.

I also love how much more of a threat the stand user seem to be. First enemy and we already have a casualty ( R.I.P Officer Grandpa )

And I thought Part 1-3 was pretty creative and clever with its way of defeating the villains but this right here took that to a whole new level. I imagined Josuke to be totally heated and straightforward making a lot of mistakes but damn he's smart. He basically makes this whole *"You can't hit me because you would hurt your friend/family"* thing redundant. 

This episode is anything I could wish from JoJo and now I slowly know why many people love it so much, truly great. 

I'm so glad I marathoned this show to fully enjoy this.
>> ARTICLE
You're in for a treat. 

There are some really interesting Stand abilities and concepts introduced from Part IV onwards. Josuke is every bit as resourceful and ingenious in a fight as his father was but without being held back by the same limitations.

I really hope DP cover the rest of JoJo as there are some truly crazy abilities and events to look forward to in later parts.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god yes! 

I totally wasn't expecting him to punch a hole into his own mother and that's when it hit me. You can use Josuke's Stand in so many creative ways. 

Yeah he already seems to me like a guy who is unpredictable once you hit the wrong button but in the end he still has honest and good intentions.

There are 9 parts, right? I can't even imagine a JoJo in today's timeline.
>> ARTICLE
I find it hard to pick a favourite JoJo, but Josuke is up there with the best of them for sure. The beauty of Crazy Diamond is just how versatile and creative it can be with its ability. There are so many stellar moments coming up but I feel I should shush about them in case I spoil something.

The manga is currently on Part VIII: JoJolion, and so far I feel it's the most bizarre part yet.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I've always been a "I don't pick favorites, I like everyone equally" kind of guy when there was a huge cast around the protagonist so I like all JoJo but Josuke has something special about him that I can't ignore. 

Yeah I'd appreciate that because knowing that it only goes up from here on out makes me extremely excited. 

Wow part 8, it will take years to reach that if the anime lives that long. JoJolion what a new. Could she be a girl? Sounds so feminine.

There 8 parts so far, with 8 still ongoing.

Honestly, one of my favorite parts about Jojo is that each part feels like an entirely different genre in many ways. Each carries such a unique feel with their own unique personalities.

I'm just bummed out because part 7 is my favorite, and I'll most likely need to wait 9~ or more years for an anime adaption of it. At least part 8 will most likely be done by then. Maybe we will get a part 9, who knows?
>> ARTICLE
At max?

Part 4= 2016 and 2017

Part 5= 2018 and 2019

Part 6 = 2020 and 2021

Part 7= 2022 and 2023

Part 8 = 2024

7 years until complete Jojo.

I feel a bit depressed when I think will take 7 years to reach Part 8. I wished I had a time machine to visit the future and don't have to wait a such long time =(
>> ARTICLE
I'm not honestly optimistic about them adapting straight through. At some point they will have a break in schedule, or at least the months in between will add up. I also really hope they take some extra time on part 5+, because the art deserves to be beyond what we have currently. I love part 4's style for part 4, but I can't really imagine it for the other parts besides maybe part 6.

I hope I still enjoy anime by then!
>> ARTICLE
A lot of content wow. 

Since I marathoned all of JoJo 4 days before DiU those differences in each path became really apparent and I loved it. 

Start watching this was one of the best decisions I made when it's about anime. 

9 years?! Are the parts that long? 
>> ARTICLE
Part 4 is 174 chapters long, so most likely ~ 2 seasons of 24 episodes give or take like 5 episodes.

Part 5 is 155 chapters, and will probably be around the same length or a little less than stardust crusaders because the chapter counts are similar. Hopefully the pacing is faster than part 3.

Part 6 is 158 chapters, so around the same.

Part 7 is 95 chapters, but the manga switched to monthly, and so the chapters are significantly longer.

Depends how long the breaks in between seasons and parts david productions takes. 
>> ARTICLE
in terms of volumes, since volume length is uniform whereas chapter length could vary between weekly and monthly series

I: a bit less than 5, because part II begins more than halfway into vol 5

II: 7

III: 16

IV: little over 18

V: almost 17

VI: 17

VII: 24

VIII: 12 so far

>And I thought Part 1-3 was pretty creative and clever with its way of defeating the villains but this right here took that to a whole new level.  

Part 4 is great for this, it's where stands really begin to come into their own and be used in cool and interesting ways. Nearly every fight has some really clever, funny or unexpected outcome.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely [Part 4](/s "They made a series of rock paper scissors matches in which the protagonist knew exactly what was going to be used awesome.")

I hope they over exaggerate everything in that "fight"
>> ARTICLE
While I'll miss the CGs in the opening, the song more than makes up for it, probably my favorite after Bloody Stream and it fits the setting and theme of this part (or at least of the first season). I just didn't liked that it became very obvious that [Part 4](/s "Koichi will get a Stand") for the anime-only people, but it is what it is.

Also it was really weird to see the story of Angelo's first crime and then suddenly this funky upbeat opening, what a bizarre transition. Talking about transitions, they are GREAT in this episode. There was a post here about the scene transitions in the first episode, and we also got cool ones here (like when Jotaro went from his hotel room to the taxi). And man, the scenes with Angelo are really creepy. When I read the manga I never cared too much about him, because he was the first villain, but he's so scary in the anime, this only makes me more excited imagining how they will handle the final villain of Part 4.

Overall, great episode, and the ED was cool too, I was expecting a RHCP song, but this was quite unexpected and worked really well. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, it could have been more obvious. Plus another character was completely excluded pretty well.

Both the OP and ED were great. The OP is going to change as the story progresses (this should be clear to manga readers, at least) and the funky, upbeat music fits the more SoL, fun nature of Part 4. The fact that they fit Angelo into one episode also speaks well for DiU's pacing, which it would seem will be much tighter than the previous part's (which tended to drag on a little).

I'm both disappointed and relieved that the ED wasn't All Star.

The main theme doesn't really feel as "hype" to me as "Stardust Crusaders" from part 3 did, but I'm sure it'll grow on me.

OP is top tier, opinions of the contrary are just whining because it's mildly different. Also, there is a bunch of foreshadowing going on [Speculative OP Spoilers](/s "So they showed every single character in the part in that whole section where everything passed by. I think Reimi was the first girl shown because Yukako had her signature pose right before Rohan's character. Also, those shockwaves around Jotaro are totally going to get turned into a Kira thing for the last few OP's. And the section where they cut from Josuke's eye is almost certainly going to be a Bites the Dust thing when that fight starts. It felt nice seeing all of the characters that are friends in that one section, but it is definitely dangerous for all of the new watchers, and I'm sad that Rohan and Yuuya weren't in that cut.")

Gotta admit, they caught me off guard with the ED though. It's great, but I really didn't expect it.

I like that they cut the explanation of Angelo's crime to this episode because the first episode wouldn't have made it to a good endpoint with it included. Also, everything about this episode was great.

[ED Spoiler](/s "So they showed characters next to where they were introduced. Jotaro, Josuke's mom, and grandpop in the town center. The Lock, Hazamada, and Yukako on the street. I believe Tonio's Restaurant was somewhere in the buildings on the street, I can't tell if they show Kira's house. Nijimura Brothers standing in front of their house. Then Josuke is holding up Yukako's house near the cape in which her and Koichi fought. It cuts through the middleschool that Shigechi gets killed in. The next part is what I assume to be an electrical grid but that is just my guess. Next shot is the place where Joseph comes in with the boat while Akira uses the objectively most annoying move in ASB. It then cuts to the J4 emblem where they have Killer Queen's logo across from the heart that Josuke symbolizes. It also has most of Josuke's cool volume cover alt outfits, including Josefumi's hole sweater.")

[removed]
>> ARTICLE
>It definitely looked more like a landmark in the manga

I think that's because they cut out the part in the manga where Angelo tried to escape by taking a kid hostage with his stand, and then gets further ground into the rock. [Spoilers for what will probably be in the next episode](/s "Or they could be waiting until next episode to show that since the part where Josuke and Jotaro interrogate Angelo, and find out about the Arrow was also cut")
>> ARTICLE
The ED shows the Manga version of Angelo's rock it comes up after Okuyasu and Keicho.

3:00   
DAAAAAAYUUUMnnn!!! O_o  
 
Edit: 12:00 Damn...;_;  
  
Edit: Well holy crap, things got grave this episode. But technically they were grave to begin with considering the adversary, here. I wasn't expecting the baddy to get beaten this early though. What now?   
  
Well, this is Jojo, there is always something to look forward to!    
  
On another note, the visuals for the OP weren't as great as the past OPs, but I like the song. The ED is cooler, to me.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing. That's it. The show's over! See you when part 5 starts!
>> ARTICLE
The new OP is actually pretty good, it has a nice funky vibe that really goes well thematically with Part 4.
>> ARTICLE
I took my lunch break early just so I could watch the new OP. Totally worth it!

Not being CGI surprises me, but I really like it already and how funky it is. I can hardly wait to watch the rest later.
>> ARTICLE
Poor little dude, everyone in the OP showing off their stands and he's got nothing.
>> ARTICLE
At least he got to POSE too! =D
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I didn't like the new JoJo after the first episode.  Just came here to say, after episode two I retract my statement.  I will give him some respect.
>> ARTICLE
So they kept mention of Angelo's worst crime in. Didn't expect that. Thought for sure that would've been left out.

Wtf was that opening that was fabulous!

So Josuke's mother still cares about Joseph. I can't believe Joseph cheated on Suzie. Really doesn't seem like the kind of thing he would do.

Josuke punches his mother right through the gut to try and get the stand out! Jesus christ I wasn't expecting that.

Oh! Dat's a Baseball! It returns! He's playing N64!

Josuke's grandad is just as much a trickster as Jotaro's I see.

Oop and he's dead. Ah but Josuke can save the day. No dead Grandfathers on his watch. Ahhhhh never mind stands can't bring people back to life unless it's with vampire blood! It's only episode 2! Why gramps why!

Ahhh the rain! He's on Jotaro!

Ah yes Lucky Land Milk. Great company I'm sure. Probably the most delicious milk ever.

Nice ending. It's not All Star though.

I'm sad they seem to have dropped the previous way they did next episode previews. I liked seeing a little footage from the next episode even if it could be spoilery.
>> ARTICLE
Jojo's Bizarre Persona 4 naturally has a Persona 4-esque OP and it's absolutely perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Listen here my Jobro(if you can call yourself that after what you just said), Jojo has been around close to a decade before the first SMT game came out and over a decade when persona hit the shelves.

David Production just has a knack for perfectly translating my favorite scenes from the manga to the anime, and this episode was no exception. There's so much to look forward to in Part 4, I can't wait!
>> ARTICLE
OP and ED were really good, based David Productions.
>> ARTICLE
Ah there's the villain killing a dog moment, I swear this show has made me immune to feeling for animal cruelty on screen. The Grandpa though...that hurt :(

So does someone come and feed the monument every few times lol because if not that's the same thing as killing him haha
>> ARTICLE
They made it less apparent in the anime for some reason, but he's completely made of stone now. Though I believe in the manga it was a slow transition to a final scene showing the complete makeover rather than his face just sticking out.
>> ARTICLE
So in like a week he'd die of starvation then? 
>> ARTICLE
To add onto what was commented earlier, in the ending you can see the rock and his future face. I believe we will see it once or twice more before this part ends.

No he's no longer human, he's a man-shaped rock.
>> ARTICLE
The word man is still in there :p

Was the robber guy a Thief-knife guy now?
>> ARTICLE
Thief guy got the knife left inside him when the rest of him got fixed up, the knife was removable.
Angelo was combined with the rock. They are fully together in an unholy undying mess.
>> ARTICLE
No, hes just alive forever, but since hes made out of stone he doesn't need food or water, all he can do is sit there and stare straight ahead, never sleeping or anything.

Basically what happened to Kars, from part 2.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but Kars is a supreme being, his body was modified to the ultimate level, this guy got a rock put into him lol. I assumed it was the same as when he put the knife in the robber, that robber isn't part knife now. 
>> ARTICLE
Its a bit different this time, it might get expanded on next episode, but he didn't get the rock put into him, he got put into the rock, as in josuke punched both of them into pieces and then switched it around.
>> ARTICLE
Guess I'll learn more once they go deeper into his powers.

Jesus... he's even worse than Dio. Not even 3 minutes into the episode and I already hate this guy.

[opening is pretty funky](https://jii.moe/VkDlPAlJZ.webm)

[Also 720p ed here](https://jii.moe/4JEbK0gkb.webm)
>> ARTICLE
I think it's a huge testament to the past JoJo openings that people are complaining about the LACK of CGI this time around. Not to say that this OP isn't fantastic though, it's absolutely perfect for part 4.

I hope this episode is a sign of things to come because the stand battle here was better than the vast majority of the stand battles in Part 3. I hear Part 4 gets really creative with stand powers, so I'm really looking forward to it!

Also it really is amazing seeing just how much better Jotaro works as a mentor/supporting character rather than the protagonist. Josuke himself is already proving to be a fantastic MC too!
>> ARTICLE
Angelo got fucking rekt. God *damn*
>> ARTICLE
That was a really creative fight, I love it! Please tell me we'll be seeing more quality fights like this - it seems like Araki is getting a fair grasp on his use of Stands.
>> ARTICLE
Yes you will, some of them are just going to be bat shit out of this world crazy. 
>> ARTICLE
And to think, last week people were saying they weren't going to talk about Angelo's most heinous crime.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, we got someone close to the MC dying in the second episode!

I cracked up at the Angelo Stone bit. Josuke was pretty creative with what he did to him.

Also, the OP is pretty decent and the ED is also good.
>> ARTICLE
It feels weird to be commenting on a new episode of JoJo. The OP was amazing and had me smiling from start to finish. I haven't liked a JoJo OP on my first hearing since the very first one so that was nice. ED wasn't All Star and I was a little disappointed at first but I honestly don't care it was still great.

I'm loving the transitions for this part so far, whether it be the Jotaro/taxi scene or the wall reforming to transition them on the other side, I really love the style this show is going for. 

They really hit all the right notes in this episode with the mood and intensity. So far so good. Really looking forward to the next arc.
>> ARTICLE
I loooooooooooooooooooooved this episode. That OP and that ED. BERRY PURITTY.
>> ARTICLE
The OP, ED and the OST are awesome, DP is doing an amazing job with this adaptation, they're fully embracing the style of part 4.
>> ARTICLE
So instead of killing him, they turned him into a macabre tourist attraction? I'm down with that, but i'd stay far far away from it.
>> ARTICLE
Jotaro said that once a life is taken, it doesn't come back, but didn't he essentially bring Joseph back to life? I mean he lost all of his blood and his heart stopped for a while, but Jotaro just had to get his heart pumping again.
>> ARTICLE
Vampire blood is different
>> ARTICLE
GG, great ending, opening music was great, I do miss the CGI openings. It didn't have any fighting scenes like the other OPs though. I will probably like it more each episode I see the opening though. Great episode!

That OP has some powerful posing and a great song.

I forgot about the dog scene from the manga...
>> ARTICLE
 Scam like Angelo don't deserved to die. For me justice is served. 
>> ARTICLE
Amazing episode. Brilliant cinematography and transitions. I liked the OP, but so far it's the worst of all of JoJo's OP. That doesn't say much, it's still good. The Ending is nice too, wasn't expecting Savage Garden. I already read the manga until chapter 33, so this part wasn't new for me, but it still was very satisfying watching this animated. Very high expectations for the rest.
>> ARTICLE
Araki wtf. Stop killing dogs
>> ARTICLE
Angelo rapes and kills teens, no one bats an eye. Angelo kills a dog?! Outrageous! Jesus people...
>> ARTICLE
DP why are you so based? 

Awesome episode with a great OP/ED confirmed. 

Loving the animation this season, SC btfo.
>> ARTICLE
God damn it Josuke, why didn't you hide/take the bottle the moment grandpa came home :(
>> ARTICLE
Angelo did have a good point about the dog shit, that pisses me off so much when dogs shit everywhere and the owners don't pick it up... Although I wouldn't bite its face off
>> ARTICLE
I probably enjoyed reading part 4 the most (just starting p6 right now) and so far, I feel like this might also be one of my favorite anime of all time. David production is really killing it. I just love everything so far, the animation, the music, the sound effects, the art style, the voice acting and even minor stuff like the transitions between scenes like when Jotaro got into the taxi after the phone call. How awesome did that look? 

Sorry, ramble over. This is the first time in a loooong while that I have been this hyped for an anime :)
>> ARTICLE
Did Josuke just make the first rock-human? I think I just caught that ref o_o
>> ARTICLE
Love the OP and ED and biggest hope is that a certain quite person with a explosive personality replaces Josuke in the ED (in the moments where he lip syncs to the lyrics preferably)
>> ARTICLE
GG, great ending, opening music was great, I do miss the CGI openings. It didn't have any fighting scenes like the other OPs though. I will probably like it more each episode I see the opening though. Great episode!  
New: OP already grew on me after watching it like the third time, I love it now!

* Well now I can never trust liquids.

* Sweet OP, will probably grow on me

* Oh, that's the ED? Well it ain't All Star, but it's still fucking awesome.
>> ARTICLE
OMG Savage Garden!
>> ARTICLE
they went Spae Dandy with the OP

it's gorgeous

almost takes me back to Battle Tendency in a way.

the ED cracked me up. back in the day, we used to call them "savage farting". I don't remember if this takes place in the 90s or not, but either way, it fits pretty well. 

I didn't make it a quarter through all the duwang scans of this manga, but what I read of it had some particularly creative stands. You guys are in for a treat with this show.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't sure how to feel about the first episode, but this was was pretty amazing.

OP is on a different level as usual.
>> ARTICLE
The OP was alright, fit the vibe pretty well.

I love how messed up that dog scene was, too bad they censor everything.

ED was amazing
>> ARTICLE
OMG Savage Garden!!! Yuuuuussssss
>> ARTICLE
I finished reading Part 6 this morning so the JoJo binge continues. Loving the animation style, I think the OP fits really well and Savage Garden was a pleasant surprise for the ED.

[OP](/s "One minutes & fifteen seconds for a OP..?")

How bizarre.

People speculate that there will be more characters appearing in OP as the show progresses, that's why it's so short now.
>> ARTICLE
The sound design is perfect, every Dorarara brings me closer to heaven.
>> ARTICLE
Josuke's badassery is over 9000
>> ARTICLE
So wait, what was the whole part at the beginning of ep 1 where the mom's arm came off? Her arm didn't come off when Josuke cured her of the stand by punching her in the stomach. 
>> ARTICLE
Totally worth holding off on reading Part IV! I'm excited for next week.
>> ARTICLE
Jotaro is still such a good boy. 

RIP grandpappy Higashigata. 

shoot I forgot what else I was going to say. good episode
>> ARTICLE
Can't say I'm all that sold on the OP, but then again the previous ones have just been so damn good it was bound to happen sooner rather than later. The ED was okay though, and the rest of the show is top notch through and through. Looking forward to it all.
>> ARTICLE
I've kind of been there and done that with long shounen anime so I try to wait before calling a series good or bad. That being said and having seen this series since part 1, I think this is going to be my favorite JoJo part so far and this MC is my favorite JoJo of them easily. The OP and ED are really cool too.
>> ARTICLE
Greato Daze
>> ARTICLE
Something I didn't quite get/understand

Why didn't Josuke's mother notice/realise she had been fisted ^kek by her son? The freeze frame even seems to show her reacting with shock but then she just blinks and continues.

Were they aiming for a "this event was too unreal for my brain to process" thing? Don't Josuke's punchees still feel pain, even if only momentarily?
>> ARTICLE
I felt it was a part of Crazy Diamond's power, rather than "healing" it restores it to a previous state. In the case of Josuke's mother, it restored her to that point where she was asking about cream and sugar with the memory of the impact not existing pretty much going forward.  

Thinking about it, it's probably the reason he can't heal himself using his stand. ~~He's not Tatsuya~~
>> ARTICLE
So is this a different power to when he punches Angelo/the delinquents? The latter seemed vividly aware that he was punched, even before his friends told him his face looked weird.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, when Angelo got punched Josuke didnt repair him; he didnt get set back to a previous state.
>> ARTICLE
How well Crazy Diamond restores things depends on how mad Josuke is.  He was pretty mad at the delinquents and Jotaro so the fix isn't great.

[episode 2 spoiler](/s "likewise when he trashes his house after his grandfather's funeral, he didn't fix the broken furnitures because he's literally not in a state of mind do do anything about it").

When he captures Aqua Necklace, he was in a very calm state of mind.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay. Thanks for the explanation!
>> ARTICLE
[Manga Content Skipped](/s "Hum, they did edit out the part where Angelo said he obtained his power when shot by someone wearing highschool uniform with a bow and arrow.")  That information comes into play in the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
People said the same thing about Angelo's final crime being omitted and look how that turned out.  
>> ARTICLE
Show is so different then other jojo shows 
>> ARTICLE
Looking at the OP and ED, and the events they foreshadow, I think we may actually have them change every 13 episodes instead of every 26, which is cool!
>> ARTICLE
My Problem so far is why jotaro use star platinum to perfomr cpr on gramps
>> ARTICLE
Did they get a new studio or something? Or did the manga style change in part 4 because everyone looks softer and lower quality. Like not even worse but it reminds me of the p4 anime.
>> ARTICLE
It's the manga that changed style in this part. The mangaka's art style changed drastically over the course of the part and it stays with the rest of the series until Part 7 where it changes again.
>> ARTICLE
It's a different style for sure, I like it though.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit disappointed the OP isn't CG like the other Jojo OPs. This one feels kinda generic.
>> ARTICLE
Opening was great, ending was eehhhh. To be honest though, the only really good jojo ending was "Roundabout".
>> ARTICLE
And Last Train Home? I really liked that one.
>> ARTICLE
It was ok, but I never really stayed through watching it and listening to it as much as roundabout and the first ending of part 3
>> ARTICLE
Dance like an egyptian
>> ARTICLE
Well that OP certainly wasn't what I expected, though I guess it fits the 90's/hip hop theme.

Is it just me, or do all the characters in the OP looks really bored?

Man I'm loving DiU so far... This is my first time really seeing stands since I skipped SC (I didn't really enjoy Jotaru's character like I do in DiU). The one thing I really miss from the old JoJo and hamon is that the stand users don't really fight themselves anymore. Other than Jotaru knocking out Josuke in the first episode, will there be any more fist fights with the non-stands?
>> ARTICLE
Jotaro gets much more likable as SC progresses. I hated him too at first, and now he's one of my favourite JoJos. There's a reason he's so popular
>> ARTICLE
Go back and watch. Don't try to be an edgelord. You are not too cool to watch Part 3, hipster.

Anime-Only here but whatever, I just gotta say I'm dropping this show. First episode seemed interesting enough, even if it's still Stand Shit but today proved that it's still garbage.

>Savage Garden as the ED. Literally Who. Even in the 90s no one cared about them.

>Super retarded Stand Asspull to beat Angelo.

Parts 1 thru 3 are dope but it looks like with Dio out the picture this show is bullshit. I'm out.

The look on his face when Tomoko started squeeing over him made me crack up.

You can feel the, "Oh, I am so going to give the old man hell for this..."
>> ARTICLE
OMG! I LOVE they played Dio's theme when they talked about Dio! It was SOOOOOOOOOOO good!

Finally! After all the part 3 questions some people had in the rewatch (like, "where the Stands came from", "How Dio got his?", and other stuff), we finally got the origin of the Stands.

Some may ask "But how about Kakyoin and Polnareff, and presumally Avdol and Iggy, got their Stands since the childhood?". Simple, because some people are BORN with the Stand, while others get a Stand throught the arrow (or in Jotaro, Holly, Joseph and Josuke case, throught the weird connection with DIO). Of course, like Holly showed, not everyone is suitable to get a Stand, and even if the arrow piece you, you can still die afterwards.


Anyway, since I like the fighting games, I will be here starting to post quotes about "Josuke's hair counter". As some people know, in the All-Star Battle and Eyes of Heaven, Josuke has a counter move that activate when the enemy hits him while he is on his counter stance (which is he brushing his hair), if a normal move connects, the damage will be nullfied, and the enemy will insult Josuke's hair, who answer as "What the hell did you said about my hair!" and enter in a Berserker state, where he does more damage but can only walk forward.


Each character has a unique quote regarding insulting Josuke's hair, and today I will post each character up to part 3 finally, and each new playable character from Part 4 who appears in the anime will get his quote posted on the episode of his debut.

It's better than post the video with all, since the video has characters of all parts up to part 8, so lot of spoilers.

Special Thanks to Vish Epic Gaming for the video!

So, here go:


**Jonathan Joestar**: "If only I could hit that strange hair with my Hamon..."


**Will.A.Zeppeli**: "What an eerie hair! What secrets does it hide?!"


**Speedwagon**: "I've seen a lot of things in my life up until now! However, I've never seen such a strange head like that!"


**Dio(Part 1)**: "What a vulgar hair..."


**Joseph Joestar(Part 2)**: "HUH! What's that gigantic thing in your head?!"


**Caesar Zeppeli**: "Stop wearing that huge clown hair."


**Lisa Lisa**: "That hairstyle is the worst..." 


**Stroheim**: "I'll pluck your hair out like the feathers of a chicken until it turns into a centimeter wide ball of yarn!"

Well that episode was slower paced than I expected, but I like it!  
Somewhere in an endless void I bet that a still very much alive Avdol is floating around while a lot of random crap appears that's being erased by Stand users with 'erasure' abilities.  
Also based David Production did it again. Not in this episode, but in foreshadowing this plot point in Stardust Crusaders. [See what DIO has on his wall?](http://i.imgur.com/So2TOtJ.jpg)

The Hand seems like a really goddamn cool stand. Sorta like a compliment to Crazy Diamond's power. Can't wait to see where the story goes from here on out.
>> ARTICLE
I find it interesting how humanoid stands are making a comeback. In the second season of Stardust Crusaders, most stands we saw tended more towards "abstract concept" than "punch ghost". The World was the only one we saw that actually fought by punching things. Others like Bastet, Horus, and Set were much weirder, and even the ones with a physical form of some sort like Cream and Osiris fought with strange magical powers. 
>> ARTICLE
don't worry. We'll get a lot of weird ass stands in part 4.
>> ARTICLE
The Hand is one of the few abilities in all of JoJo's that Crazy Diamond can't counter. Vanilla Ice's Cream is another, since they both send things to another dimension where nothing can return from.
>> ARTICLE
Okuyasu is super interesting because he's sort of an inversion of what we see so often in the Jojo series. Usually, a really smart user makes a weak or highly situational Stand into a huge threat, but here The Hand has so much potential to just destroy everything, but poor Okuyasu's too dim to fully utilize it.

Dim and kind-hearted. He's just a normal schoolboy delinquent, not a murderous psychopath. He likes getting into fights but he's not just going to kill someone outright. Yeah he *can* use The Hand to murder everything in his way, but he's not that kind of person.

I gotta hand it to David, they did a great job with The Hand. Although, using the same sound effect they used for ZA WARUDO was slightly distracting, it was still pretty great.

Now that we've been introduced to the arrow, I can share an easter egg that was in Part 3. [Here in DIO's room](http://i.imgur.com/RbIIFqX.png), you can actually see the bow and arrow on the wall. It's not the best quality picture, but it's the first one I found.

Though you both stand out because I followed you during the rewatch(to find the threads easily) and never unfollowed. 

Also, given that tag, you will be completely floored by the fact that I won't be running a counter for my own rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't remember seeing it in the manga.

Ofcourse not, since Araki probably hadn't thought of it yet, the guy makes up new stuff at an impressive rate, and then ditches it after one chapter half the time (like remember that super strong Attack Star Platinum had that showed up once and then never again?), not that I'm mad tho, I love the manga and will eat up anything he presents, but thats just how it is :D

>> ARTICLE
If you're talking about Star Finger, Araki mentioned in some interview that the early-on power for Star Platinum was gaining the ability of every Stand it defeated and then he realized that that's really broken so he never brought it up ever again. Star Finger is from beating Hierophant Green
>> ARTICLE
So the original plan was for SP to be Mega Man? 
>> ARTICLE
Aw, you don't like the arrow? I'm not really sure what you mean. They hinted at DIO being given a Stand by Enya somehow, now we're just learning the how.
>> ARTICLE
>  They hinted at DIO being given a Stand by Enya somehow

Ah must have missed that, I always assumed it was hereditary due to Johnathan's body and that's why Jotaro's stand is so similar. Maybe I just made that headcanon though since it made sense to me and there wasn't too much explanation on stands at the time.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the Arrow forcibly awakens one's Stand. Since DIO had Jonathan's body struck with the Arrow to give himself a Stand, it forced Stands to awaken in all of Jonathan's living blood descendants as well. That's why Jotaro suddenly had Star Platinum and could unconsciously use it without understanding it, and why Holly started dying from a Stand that she was never meant to have due to her lack of fighting spirit.
>> ARTICLE
Enya stabbed DIO with the arrow, which somehow cursed the Joestars with Stands. I still don't know how that works, but we just go with it.
>> ARTICLE
Something to do with the Joestar spirit or something probably, seeing as its not really Dio's body at the time.

I checked out Okuyasu's VA because he sounded very familiar and it turns out he's also Knuckle in Hunter x Hunter so it looks like Wataru Takagi consistently voices characters with the coolest powers no matter what show he's in! What a nice gig!

When I was reading Part 4, I always imagined him as sounding like Knuckle, so I was blown away when it turned out that it was. 

Little did I know, it's been that way in the games for years, but still. 
>> ARTICLE
> Although, using the same sound effect they used for ZA WARUDO was slightly distracting

It uses the same base sound, the *Vwroooop*, but it lacks the ticking slowing down and stopping. I imagine a lot of the space-time manipulating stand will use this sound, which I like because I adds something Araki isn't particularly good at: consistency.
>> ARTICLE
I remember this back during part 3 and had to keep my mouth shut. I LOVE the little references they make. 
>> ARTICLE
That just further supports my new theory that the bow+arrow are ancient relics linked to Egypt... probably related to the Egyptian God stands, but like... instead of being an object with super stand powers, it's an object that gives super stand powers to insividuals. Like the Masks made you a vampire.
>> ARTICLE
> they did a great job with The Hand.

Definitely seems like one of those Stands that would be a lot cooler animated. 
>> ARTICLE
This Part has a few fights that were a little bit hard to follow in the manga, so I'm really looking forward to seeing those animated. Great start with The Hand!

I agree, specially when they break things or Josuke restores stuff, Araki draws every single stone and dust cloud, so some fights look very cluttered, specially in BW where colors blend together.

There's also [this scene](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/977/557/617.png) in Stardust Crusaders S2 finale when DIO was explaining how he started utilizing his time-stop powers.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree, the animation of The Hand was pretty amazing, I'm really glad as well since Okuyasu is one of my favorite characters in the series.
>> ARTICLE
I really like how Araki does power balancing, the contrast between stand's power and the user's personality can be huge. Here we see the intelligence and sitautional awareness of the user screw over a uber-powerful stand, but in some cases we can see a skilled combatant overcome their weaknesses, kinda like Joseph not being as good at Hamon but still having crazy intelligence and ~~asspulls~~ environmental flexibility. 
>> ARTICLE
what's truly broken is a stand user who has an OP ability and is smart enough to use it creatively. I can think of a few examples already.

Imagine if Young Joseph got Okuyasu's stand. He would be even more OP than Ultimate Kars.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. In fact, The Hand is one of the few things in JoJo that would be able to kill Ultimate Kars.
>> ARTICLE
Just out of curiosity since you brought him up, is Ultimate Kars more powerful than P3 Dio?
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. Time Stop doesn't matter since DIO doesn't have any way to destroy Ultimate Kars. Eventually he'll slip up and Ultimate Kars will kill him.
>> ARTICLE
I think that Za Warudo's massive reaction speed advantage and acceleration advantage should allow him to constantly keep Kars at bay, not to mention that he could mislead Kars by Time-Stopping and then slipping away to catch his breath (if he has one anymore). A fight between the two seems more like a stalemate.
>> ARTICLE
i think that most stands that rip or manipulate time and space will have that sound. which is still a satisfying sound
>> ARTICLE
Also, notice something about the beginning of the first Stardust Crusaders ed? https://youtu.be/wV_CwCTOOMI
>> ARTICLE
The clock's hand...

That ED is too OP it foreshadows even the following season!

When you think about it, Jotaro's fear of the arrow creating a powerful stand is actually pretty terrifying. Can you even imagine something more powerful than that of Za Warudo's power?
>> ARTICLE
I just can't imagine anything more op than stopping time... 
>> ARTICLE
They definitely exist. I can think of at least two protagonists and three different main villains who could mop the floor with DIO.

[Spoilers for later Parts](/s "For those who are wondering, End-of-series Johnny Joestar and End-of-series Giorno Giovanna could do it, as well as Enrico Pucci with Made In Heaven, Funny Valentine, and Diavolo. Rohan Kishibe could also do it very easily, depending on the circumstances.")

Pucci's Stand is [Part 6](/s "Time acceleration. It naturally counters time stop because it infinitely decreases the amount of time you can stop time for.

He isn't the "main villain", but he has a huge role in the story. Also, the colorization team is currently working on Steel Ball Run and are about halfway through it currently.

Also, from what I've heard, Part 7 is generally considered to be the best part of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. It also has my personal favorite Stand in it, Catch the Rainbow.

For your second point, I was basically referring to the strongest version of each character, and I did mean Golden Experience Requiem.

>> ARTICLE
ah, man that gets me pretty hyped. I really hope they adapt all jojo.

But 2 MCs and 3 villains? I just cant see jojo getting another big villain like Dio now with the later parts.. especially now when it's more of a "slice of life" with part 4 (just from what I have read, but it doesn't feel like that in part 4 so far, and I hope they continue with this with something always happening and stuff)

Believe me, DIO is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Jojo villains, the one on this part is particularly amazing.

This entire thread just makes me want to blurt out everything I know.

Hello! During the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure rewatch I've been tallying all of the references Jojo's Bizarre Adventure makes to music. I am going to be continuing that trend in this new season!

[The music references list as of Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4cspal/rewatchspoilers_jojos_bizarre_adventure_stardust/d1l4m4b).

---
###**Part 4**
---

* Josuke's Stand, Crazy Diamond (called "Shining Diamond" in the Crunchyroll subs) is named after the Pink Floyd song, *Shine On You Crazy Diamond*.

* Anjuro "Angelo" Katagiri's nickname comes from *Angelo Badalamenti*, a composer for Twin Peaks.

* Angelo's stand's name is *Aqua Necklace*. It's unknown what exactly this is referencing, but it might be the album *Aqua* by Asia.

* Okuyasu's stand's name is *The Hand*, a reference to the band called... *The Band*.

**Reference Count: 4**
>> ARTICLE
Maybe also add that between the katakana for Band () and Hand (), the " is *erased*
>> ARTICLE
Okay, that's pretty goddamn clever.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit this episode was amazing. The effects, transitions and SE are better in the third episode of DiU then they were in probably the whole of Stardust Crusaders. Specially in the ~~The Hand~~ ZA HANDO fight and when Angelo got his stand.
 
And talking about the ZA HANDO, DP did the same thing they did with Angelo: in the manga I didn't think too much about it, but in the anime it's so well done, it's something that would be worth of a main villain in most anime.

IF DP manages to keep this level of quality during this Part there are some fights in the future that go right to the top of my favorite moments in anime. [Part 4](/s "I'm listening to Another One Bites The Dust on loop in preparation for that moment.")

On a side note, Koichi's pose in the OP became a meme. [Here](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/104/788/b07.png) [are](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/104/239/ffd.jpg) [some](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/103/658/ba5.png) [of](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/103/652/813.jpg) [my](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/103/657/94a.jpg) [favorites](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/103/323/3c4.png).

Aww yiss, The Hand! One of the coolest stands, imo. I love how they brought back the ZA WARUDO sound. This fight was awesome in the manga, but animated is nearly perfect. 

Fun fact, as with all stands in JoJo, The Hand's name is a musical reference to a band called [The Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band). Why is it called that? Because the katakana look nearly similar.

The Band:   
The Hand:

Hello everyone, after last week's success, I'm now planning to keep this tree going for the rest of the season.

#For Newcomers and non-manga readers:

Feel free to discuss the events of the episode and your conclusions/speculations below (though bear in mind to spoiler tag predictions). It doesn't have to be serious. I will personally try to respond to everyone given that I'm a newcomer myself.

I will not be forcing anyone to participate in this, I'm only seeking to create a safe zone for newcomers to discuss in without external influence. 

Manga readers, if you must participate, please refrain from confirming or denying anything to come. We're all here because we're hyped, no need to sell us on Part 4 after we watched 3 of them.

Also, due to Jojo's air time, I can usually catch it about an hour afterwards, but I'll be posting this the moment the thread comes out.

That being said, let loose!

Oh right. My bad

It's similar to the Stands in Part 3, where the Stand is decided based on the user's personality.

So my hopes of Koichi getting the most bad-ass stand of them all are now dashed. Thanks smurf.

Koichi's totally badass! Haven't you seen the meme?

I really like the ancient bow and arrow giving people Stands concept. I hope there's a connection between it and the OG vampire mask that will be explored in the future. 


Also still loving Josuke's personality and how triggered he gets when someone insults his hair. Hype is confirmed still unbreakable. 
>> ARTICLE
>I hope there's a connection between it and the OG vampire mask that will be explored in the future.

I'm not as optimistic as you are. I feel like it's a plot device and that's it.

Josuke is definitely carrying the part for me. Jotaro will probably be conveniently unavailable whenever an enemy stand user shows up.
>> ARTICLE
I hope it becomes connected but if not oh well :/

Agreed! Feels like Jotaro is getting the Joseph treatment for this part. I feel like we're just waiting for the crew to be formed before the real shit goes down. 
>> ARTICLE
>before the real shit goes down

Hey, a dude totally got sniped with an arrow today. What is your definition of shit going down?
>> ARTICLE
Hmm good point. More of MCs dying in dramatic battles. 
>> ARTICLE
A stand that can erase is pretty neat. You can have a lot of creative uses with that like this episode with erasing space to close the distance. Looking forward to seeing more ideas Araki can come up with using a fairly versatile power. 
>> ARTICLE
I said this somewhere in this thread, but I think the reason the bow and arrow was such a throwaway idea was probably to give Araki freedom of design.

He can even make stands that surpass ZA WARUDO now.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Like Jotaro says in the end of the episode, the biggest fear is that it falls into wrong hands and a Stand even more powerful than the The World could be born, which, even as a viewer, is a prospect that is terrifying indeed, due the power of The World.

The tension is all high.

So I really liked the introduction of something that can give a random Stand, weak or powerful, to someone who are able to get one. 
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the way it was portrayed, with the arrow ripping the Stand out of you as it's pulled out. It's a great way of showing how the arrow doesn't GIVE you a Stand so much as it awakens your latent potential for one.
>> ARTICLE
So was he on the phone with Joseph? Doesn't look like he'll be showing up but at least we got to see the mom meet Jotaro was hoping that would happen!

The whole bow and arrow giving stands thing seems pretty silly to me. I mean Stands didn't have too much reasoning behind them before but this bow and arrow is pretty bleh, hope they go into it more though.

Also WTF Josuke!? [You can't just break the Jojo rule](http://i.imgur.com/xbFJ6yU.png)!

What do you mean? [Stardust Spoilers](/s "They talked about the bow in Stardust Crusaders. Dio and the old lady that was in Jotaro's photo revealed it was the source of most of Dio's stand users powers.")
>> ARTICLE
They never mentioned the arrow in SC, because Araki hadn't come up with the idea of the arrow yet.

David put the bow and arrow up on DIO's wall towards the end, but they never said that the arrow was what gave him his Stand.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
The bow and arrow is weird because it gives people stands, yet there are a bunch of characters in part 3 who had stands from the moment they were born.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, those were all assassins sent by DIO.
>> ARTICLE
Both are weird :p
>> ARTICLE
The way I see it, Araki made the bow and arrow so he can have free reign with stand design. I disagree with the method, but the results were awesome! Did you see that creepy white stand that 'scrapes' stuff?
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah I love the new stands on how they more break space/time like that. It's fun to watch!
>> ARTICLE
Inb4 every new stand is somehow stronger than DIO's...
>> ARTICLE
Going to be hard to top ZA WARUDO or actually Star Platinum since it's even more OP
>> ARTICLE
DIOs was more OP with a much stronger time control that Jotaro has. And Star Platinum is limited to punching. 
>> ARTICLE
We still haven't seen blondie's stand and I'm banking on it being something stupidly strong.
>> ARTICLE
I was kind of hoping he didn't have a stand and that's why he used the bow and arrow to give people powers to do the work for him.

But going the Jojo route he'll probably be super OP and just sends his minions out to fight his battles because he's overconfident which will lead to his downfall. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so, Okaysu said even his brother was afraid of his Stand, implying his Stand is stronger.
>> ARTICLE
Just because he's scared of it doesn't necessarily mean it's stronger.
>> ARTICLE
That's still within the realm of possibility. He probably has a stand, but we can't be sure yet.

As far as minions go, that's probably will be how it ends up, but for now, they need to somehow defuse the current situation.

My money is on Koichi waking up with a brand new stand that can beat the shit out of everybody.
>> ARTICLE
I **really** want Koichi to get a stand because right now he just feels so ~~much like Speedwagon~~ useless :/
>> ARTICLE
[removed]

[removed]
>> ARTICLE
I mean bow and arrow makes slightly more sense than eating fruits to gain superpowers. It's kinda the "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" method.
>> ARTICLE
I think he was on the phone with someone from the Speedwagon foundation. 


>> ARTICLE
In a world where a Stone Mask can turn you into a Vampire, I don't believe it was too much of a strech to believe something can give you Stands, right? =P

But don't worry, they will, like the Stone Mask, explore more this concept.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed the stone mask since it had roots with Jonathan's archaeologist roots so it tied in a bit. Putting on a mask and gaining powers is also a simple concept but getting shot by a bow and arrow? What is this cupid? lol

But yeah looking forward to them exploring it more.
>> ARTICLE
but it being the only arrow is what makes it unique if someone destroys it then rip artificial stands 
>> ARTICLE
> if someone destroys it then rip artificial stands

Pretty sure they'd just come up another random thing to use :p
>> ARTICLE
Bow and Arrow are ancient tools, right? Maybe they relate somehow to those funky Egyptian God stands?
>> ARTICLE
Could be! Would be weird to go back to Egyptian Gods after having closed the book on them but I guess it would be a sort of callback? Also makes you wonder if it is ancient were there stand users in the past as well? 
>> ARTICLE
Well, it would kinda tie-in to some of the elements of episode 1 and 2. It doesn't even need to be Egyptian, just have ended up in Egypt, I guess. The Egyptian  stands all seemed kinda linked to physical items with the sword and book standing out the most. Specifically using the sword as an example, item locked stands seem like they could last quite some time, right? And we got the hint at the start of this episode that most of the people who disappeared were young and so the side-effect of multigenerational stands isn't an issue, right? 

So... uh.... maybe the potential down sides of say a royal heir having stand powers because their parents did was recognized so special items modeled to fall between human stands and the magical bow and arrow were created to be used instead, kinda like how the mask can turn humans into shitty imitation pillar people. Maybe every stand user is descended from someone who had their stand abilities unlocked in the distant past. Or their was an ancient tribe and they had abnormally high rates of natural stands and the bow and arrow were used in a ritual to unlock stand powers of those who didn't have them (or originally just to execute them then eventually it became magic.... somehow). From vague hints and partial spoilers I've read on other subreddits it seems like Stands are here to stay, but that somehow something fundamentally changes in part 5 and onward so I think we're at least in for a lot more backgtound on stands like the mask in part 2 and so the Egyptian connection in part 3 being expanded on like that of the mask and stuff from part 1 makea sense from a literary parallelism argument. 
>> ARTICLE
>  And we got the hint at the start of this episode that most of the people who disappeared were young and so the side-effect of multigenerational stands isn't an issue, right?

So it could be a multigenerational item like an heirloom? That would be a pretty nice way to go along with it. 

Hey if they go down that path and the history of stands I'm all for it!



>> ARTICLE
That's a good way to put it: heirloom. And maybe the bow and the god-stands weren't the only ones, but just the bow and the mysteries surrounding it could be enough for a story, I think.
>> ARTICLE
Would be enough backstory for me!
>> ARTICLE
Plus, having it as a bow and arrow seems more fitting for showing how unnatural it is at times to tear forth a stand from inside the user, as it did for Angelo, and make it seem like a more conscious intentional effort to let loose these wacky and often dangerous powers, rather than a more immobile source like with fruit that places the intention on the receiver than the giver.
>> ARTICLE
You just made that sound way more complicated than what's happening lol. 

While the act of tearing out a stand is a nice idea, a bow and arrow isn't too wacky haha. I'd be much more inclined to believe in some fruit hidden away from humanity granting the user powers if they are worthy then what is currently a random bow that has somehow found it's way to this town.

Like I've said before, this is just as it looks now and I'm sure they'll explore it better later.
>> ARTICLE
A fruit that grants power to the worthy might work, and while I was thinking along the lines of forcing the power upon others for the bow I guess fruit could do the same. Hopefully they do use it well tho.
>> ARTICLE
> Also WTF Josuke!? You can't just break the Jojo rule!

Just look at that hair. That's the hair of a delinquent who doesn't follow the rules.
>> ARTICLE
[HEY!](https://i.imgur.com/lMaN8Cd.png)
>> ARTICLE
So, getting shot through the mouth with an arrow gives you a stand? I'll pass.

I loved how Josuke just went 'Yo, Angelo' when he walked by that rock.

Ahahaha... the rock became a landmark!

Oooh... Jotaro meeting Mama Jojo... and she actually thinks he's Joseph... That was an awesome scene, but it felt sad, too. Damn, you could feel it hit her hard when she learned Joseph won't be showing up.

WTF!? Koichi got shot with an arrow! And mister 'scars look cool' is the brother of big bad guy... This pacing is unreal...

Now that's one smooth looking stand.

Haha... Talking isn't free action anymore?

Well, with a stand called 'The Hand', I'd be suspicious of its hands, too.

Very interesting stand concept. Very flexible, too. Range doesn't mean much to it.

That blondie gives me DIO flashbacks. And apparently the bow and arrow give stands through a jackpot selection.
>> ARTICLE
You actually don't even have to get shot by it if I remember correctly, just the arrow head cutting you will do it.

At 20:50, Koichi was being dragged away slowly while Josuke was strangling Okuyasu. I loved the attention to detail in the background, and it was pretty hilarious seeing his outstretched arm immobile.
>> ARTICLE
You can also see and hear Josuke walking past Okuyasu when he's talking with his brother.  Most other shows would have cut that entirely and just been like AND THEN JOSUKE WAS BEHIND HIM, OOOOO
>> ARTICLE
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous occasion. For the first time in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, 

talking was **not** a free action.
>> ARTICLE
Josuke's real power is that he can use immediate actions and has the 3.5 Rules Compendium. Godamm ~~Wizards~~ Araki power creep.
>> ARTICLE
Josuke is the General Tarquin of Jojo.
>> ARTICLE
I did not expect a OoTs reference here.

Yea, Josuke is pretty savvy and fun loving at times, and alternates to really pissed off but a quasi-stoic fury at others, although I don't know if he has the level of puns or pre-planned schemes of Tarquin. Still, the power to break tropes is pretty OP.
>> ARTICLE
Let's hope he doesn't get his hands on a candle.
>> ARTICLE
I think omnipotence might be a bit out of left field for JoJo, but it surely wouldn't be the most bizarre path to power.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so glad the Stands are getting more creative and unique. Thought Josuke's was the only one but this Okuyasu dude has an interesting one as well. On the other hand, kinda bummed that Dio wasn't born a Stand user since he was dope and Za Warudo was OP as hell. 
>> ARTICLE
If he had been, none of the Joestars would have been Stand users.

Basically, DIO while wearing Johnathon's body was hit with the arrow back in the 80s, making him a Stand user. Since Stand use is inherited, it retroactively made anyone oh Johnathon's bloodline (since it was Johnathon's body that was hit) Stand users as well.

Part of why DIO hangs back so much through the early part of 3 was he was STILL adapting to controlling Johnathon's body, and as such couldn't use The World, which was actually JOHNATHON'S Stand technically, as well as he wanted. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually The World is DIO's stand, the Hermit Purple like one that he uses near the beginning is Jonathans stand.

"Along with activating his own Stand The World, it was stated that DIO's semi-precognitive abilities that seemed to have resulted from a Hermit Purple-like Stand were due to a Stand power that awoke in the body of Joseph's grandfather Jonathan Joestar."

http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Unnamed_Stands#cite_note-0

>> ARTICLE
Dude, can you imagine Dio having The World in phantom blood? He would've fodderized Jonathan and crew 
>> ARTICLE
I always thought it was dormant within him during Phantom Blood or he didn't awaken the powers yet. But earlier comments explained everything

[](#papithumbsup)
>> ARTICLE
Well, it was a dormant ability, the Arrow doesn't pull stands out of thin air, it unlocks potential that was already there.
>> ARTICLE
That's one of the reasons why Part 4 is so loved and you understand why hamon was dropped, the stands are all awesome. They get kinda weird in later parts, but even stands with single special abilities like Crazy Diamond's fixing or The Hand's deletion have so many possible abilities that it makes for great fights.
>> ARTICLE

>That's one of the reasons why Part 4 is so loved and you understand why hamon was dropped, the stands are all awesome.

Tbh, I almost forgot hamon existed, despite liking it more than Stands in the beginning. Looking forward to more crazy Stands down the road.
>> ARTICLE
Then you have the weirdos who have read the whole manga and still like hamon more LOL.
>> ARTICLE
Hamon was a concept that would have made the JoJo series a ticking timebomb honestly. Its good araki changed it to stands when he did because Hamon was running out of originality fast. And JoJo didn't truly turn into semi-random shit happening until middle of part 4
>> ARTICLE
I think that happens to everyone. I was mad salty when they dropped hamon in Part 3, but after reading DIU I realized how dull it would have been if they didn't adopt stands. The later fights have such crazy and [](/s "bizarre") stands.
>> ARTICLE
> On the other hand, kinda bummed that Dio wasn't born a Stand user since Za Warudo was dope and OP as hell.

Well, they stated in Part 3 that Enya was the one that gave DIO his Stand, they just never said how.

Hey everybody! I'm filling in for /u/VincentBlack96 today.

Just like he did in the Hero Academia thread, we're going to be collecting data on newcomer to source reader ratios.

Please take a few seconds of your time to participate in the strawpoll:

[**Strawpoll here!!**](http://strawpoll.me/7372040)

The results will be posted in next week's thread.

Thank you for your time and have a good day!
>> ARTICLE
Given the current ratio, it seems that manga readers are not an extreme majority. If so, it is a shame that anime newcomers have to take refugee in a single top-level thread.

In this episode discussion only, a few people have already spoiled that [](/s "Okuyasu changes sides, becomes friendly with the protagonists") by posting his nickname.
>> ARTICLE
The PV also has it as well.

[](#yuishrug)

I view it as one of those things that isn't really an important spoiler. 
>> ARTICLE
The important spoilers aren't in the OP/ED/PVs, nothing.
>> ARTICLE
The episode just aired a few minutes ago, I'd say that the big JoJo fans are the ones who watch it as soon as possible, so give it time and anime-only people will start voting on it too.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a shame. But like others said, it's in the OP. There are other things they could be spoiling instead that aren't in the OP.
>> ARTICLE
*finger snapping intensifies*
>> ARTICLE
In fairness though the OP kinda blatantly spoils that as well.
>> ARTICLE
It's The Polnareff effect.

I didn't saw ANY anime only viewer who thought Polnareff would burn to cinders in his fight with Avdol and be a one-shot only Villain.

Literally no one. Because he appears in a central role in the OP and Ending.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair [](/s "Okuyasu has a major part in the OP where he doesn't exactly look like a villain.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, even as an anime only watcher, I guessed that would happen right off the bat.
>> ARTICLE
Glad they brought up the reason why DIO just suddenly had a stand.
>> ARTICLE
I love that that theme when Jotaro is on the phone is a mix of the Stardust Crusaders track.

Anyone else feel that the sound effects are a little too loud? I have to turn up the volume to properly hear the voices and then nearly deafen myself whenever Josuke Dorarararas someone.

Ooooh mention of Dio. He may be dead but looks like his influence lives on. Also looks like getting shot with the arrow is definitely not painless.

Oooooh shit his insulted Josuke's hair! Rip Angelo.

I love that battle theme. Can't wait for the ost.

So David Productions having the bow and arrow in Dio's mansion as a cameo works. Dio didn't develop The World himself, it was given to him.

I like how they keep mentioning that it's 1999 right now.

Instead of a Stand stat page we get Angelo. God he looks horrible.

How in the world could she mistake Jotaro for Joseph? Joseph doesn't exactly look as young as he used to. If Josuke was 5 during the events of Stardust Crusaders then Joseph became a cheating bastard only about 6 years prior to Part 3. I doubt he looked much younger.

"Joseph you're back! I've been so lonely!"

"Wtf Grandad?"

The track used here is one from Part 3 I believe.

Ah so is the next one too. Jojo doesn't often reuse tracks from previous seasons so it's nice to hear these.

Oh shit Enya's the one holding the bow and arrow. She still bandaged her hand even back then.

Koichi! Oh my gooooood!

Snap Okayasu's stand looks pretty badass.

I really like the aura that surrounds a stand user in this Part. Way better than the Stand just appearing like it did in Part 3.

I see you dragging Koichi away Okayasu's brother.
>> ARTICLE
god okuyasu is the best
>> ARTICLE
Looks like he had confidence in his right hand (   ) 
>> ARTICLE
such a shame that such a powerful stand fell into the hands of a dip shit

You'll find yourself saying that repeatedly throughout JoJo.

I would just like to mention that the music in this series is hype as hell.

My boy Koichi gonna kick ass with whatever his stand is.

Oh cool, they revealed how Dio got his stand.

I really like The Hand. One of the cooler Stands we've seen so far.

Ah, Kuwabara!

The gold haired dude with the bow and arrow looks like what would happen if polnareff and Dio were fused together...gold hair, polnareff style, and being ambiguously evil!

I am in LOVE with the scene transitions in this show. they really take advantage of all of what animation is possible as a medium and give the show a more comic book type feel.
>> ARTICLE
A quick question, you can put it in spoilers if you'd like.

In terms of combat abilities, is Jotaro still one of the highest ranking stand users in the JoJo universe? I remember him been one of (if not the) best stand fighters at the end of Stardust Crusaders, he went One on One with Dio, beat him, and can stop time. But In the first episode, he had greatly reduced time stoppping capabilities, but he could still stop time. 

I would hate to think he could no longer hold his own in the coming fights, and Josuke becomes the top dog.
Even in the coming seasons, how does Star Platinum, along with Jotaro, come in terms of rankings, does he become more or less powerful than the end of SDC? 
>> ARTICLE
Even with spoilers, I won't reveal much about Jotaro's standing on part 4, so I will answer your questions without spoiling yourself too much.

[Spoiler](/s "Physical power? Yes. Jotaro is still really high reated on that.")

[Spoiler](/s "Stand overall power, AKA, how much broken Star Platinum is? Kinda. Time Stop is still a powerful ability, but there would be another ability that I think is FAR more broken than Stopping Time. But all in all, Jotaro is still strong. I don't believe you would be dissapointed with his fights")
>> ARTICLE
Like Joseph and his Hamon abilities in part 3, Jotaro hasn't been training or using SP's time stop in all these years, so his time-stopping limit has regressed a little bit. 

That being said, Jotaro is *still* the strongest stand user in part 4, the only thing is that he's more of a supporting character this time around and isn't in too many fights
>> ARTICLE
Can we talk about how on point the series' shot composition and music has been so far? I am loving the scene transitions thus far. They give a lot of life and bizarreness to the scenarios presented. Keep it up David. I am enjoying this more than the manga which is my favorite JoJo part that I've read (Reading part 5 atm). 
>> ARTICLE
I really hope Koichi does end up getting his own stando. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, he _does_ make that really awkward pose in the opening in between Josuke and Okuyasu showing off their stands.
>> ARTICLE
I believe you mean awesome pose.
>> ARTICLE
The dark clouds transitioning into the prison flashback, the umbrella wipe, the visual effects of the arrow granting a Stand. David Productions has been absolutely *killing* it with the adaptation, it's great. Also, anime watchers, you may want to rewatch the scene where Josuke and Jotaro talk about their "next enemy", look at what's between them, at about 7 minutes into the episode. This is my favorite episode of DiU so far.

[Later Part 4 spoilers](/s "A caterpillar transitions to a scene with Koichi. If they keep that one going through the season alongside Koichi's evoluting Stand, it'll make for some great theming.")
>> ARTICLE
Talk... to THE HAND!

Also that arrow...ow ow ow ouch.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny, ever since 2009 when FMA: Brotherhood started airing, it seems like we have had at least one seriously high quality long-running. Shounen adaptation currently airing. After FMA ended we got Hunter X Hunter in 2011 and JoJo a year later. Now HXH is over and JoJo is getting seriously great. Maybe this trend will continue and we'll get another awesome adaptation around the time JoJo ends.
>> ARTICLE
Well, at the current rate of adaptation, assuming JoJo ends with part 9 like we suspect, it should end somewhere around 2030-2032.
>> ARTICLE
Why do people think it's gonna end with Part 9? lol. 
>> ARTICLE
Can't really explain the reasons why without massive spoilers. 

Essentially with the way Part VII and VIII have been going Part IX could tie everything together perfectly. I'd like JoJo to carry on however, as it's my favourite manga series by far.
>> ARTICLE
What spoilers, it's just based on Araki wanting to stop at 60, so if he keeps the rate at which hes drawing and delivering, he would have time to finish JoJolion and then make PT9.
>> ARTICLE
Spoil away, i read the manga lol. 
>> ARTICLE
[Obviously, lotsa spoilers] (/s "Basically, JoJo works in threes. We start with Jonathan, Joseph and Jotaro in 1 2 and 3. In 5, 4 and 6, respectively, we have a part with each of their kids. That's the first set of threes, and then we we have 2 parts so far in the SBR verse. We don't have anywhere near the connection between Jo2uke and Johnny as we did before, but it still seems likely that there will be one more part, finishing off the final set of three.")
>> ARTICLE
That's a fair enough thought. Though, who's to say it can't go further anyways? Of course, it's been going on for a while now, so i can see why people think it might be ending soon, but....

Oh well, thanks! 
>> ARTICLE
The main reason is not trilogy themed or whatever, Araki said he wanted to retire at 60 and at the rate he's going, he would have time to finish JoJolion and do PT9.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, he had a damn good run lol. 

Though, i'm still convinced he's immortal anyway tbh...
>> ARTICLE
Pillarmen
>> ARTICLE
It's notable that [later Part 4](/s "Kishibe Rohan straight-up states that he wants to end his own manga series with Part 9. Rohan's a character that Araki identifies with and enjoys, so a lot of fans think he was communicating his own intent through Rohan.")

Also, [franchise spoilers](/s "Part 7 was theoretically based on Part 1 but with heavy Part 3 influence. Part 8 has been clearly based on Part 4 but potentially with some Part 2 influence in the form of the Rock Humans concept (though that's more of a theory so far.) That would leave Part 9 with Parts 5 and 6 to work with in order to have the SBR-verse borrow and remix the first 6 Parts.")
>> ARTICLE
Part 8 is not even in the middle yet, so yeah, it will take a LONG time.

Unless it return to the weekly format instead the Monthly format, but I doubt that.
>> ARTICLE
To clarify, I was referring to the JoJo anime. At the rate things are progressing, Araki will definitely stop with part 9, since he has said more than once that he plans to retire in his sixties, and he's like 58 or something now.
>> ARTICLE
More proof he's a vampire or a Pillar man, he's 58 and looks like he's 20.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, DavidPro did a really good job with The Hand fight. Loved it! I really gotta resist the urge to binge read part 4 again... or do I?
>> ARTICLE
The Hand is truly a great stand that really fits it's user, it even comes with built in dollar signs.
Koichi gets shot, what an eggcelent development.
So talking isn't a free action now? Looks like Jotaro's time stops just got shorter.
Arrows are very important maguffins through parts 4-6, they're here to stay, so anime only watchers should start getting used to them.
The way DP animated ZA HANDO makes me really exited for the upcoming fights, next episode will be quite great, Keicho's theme gives me high hopes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's just me, but does anyone else find the sound quality in this show to be like really, really, really good? My Sennheisers get the job done, but they seem to work really well with this show.
>> ARTICLE
This is the first I am hearing about this anime. Anyone mind giving me a quick non-spoiler review?
>> ARTICLE
It follows the adventures of the manly and fabulous descendants of Jonathan Joestar as they fight against various evils. It's divided into parts, with each part being centered on a different member of the Joestar bloodline. At first it's magic sun kung fu vs vampires and super vampires, but after the first two part, it changes to Stands, which are like psychic spirit type things that all have unique abilities.
>> ARTICLE
Manly uncanny valley.
>> ARTICLE
I would just go watch the first season and see if you like it. Don't read anything about it. It's more fun going in blind.
>> ARTICLE
It's an epic tale about the Joestars, within each part a different generation of the Joestars fight a great evil that threatens the world. It's old series that oozes with style and glamour, over the top fast paced action with the most absurd situations.

It's the best shonen ever made.

Every week, this show is filling me with joy. Since I've read the manga, I get to sit back and go "Ooh! Here comes this cool thing!"

And now we have the Hand. One of the most fun and interesting Stand ideas yet, it sends anything it contacts (even air) into another space/dimension. Things near the resulting vacuum are drawn in. We've already seen 1-2 creative uses of this power, and there's more to come. 
>> ARTICLE
One of my biggest problems with Stardust Crusaders was its monster of the week style formula, and so far this season seems to be getting away from that. I'm excited to see what comes next?

The Hand is also one of the coolest Stands I've seen so far. Deleting space seems like something with a lot of potential for creative application.
>> ARTICLE
DiU is monster of the week too.  The difference is DiU has better characters and more interesting battles/stands.
>> ARTICLE
It's less monster of the week and more event of the week, really. Sometimes there's no big fight.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. Part 4 is amazing, can confirm.
>> ARTICLE
I can't stop watching [Part 4's Opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVPZumh2PE) over and over again. Incredibly catchy music, jazzy animation sequence that throws in a ton of foreshadowing (I assume, as I'm an anime-only fan)...I can go on and on. I hope they release it as a single; I will import that shit faster than you can say DURARARARARARA.
>> ARTICLE
I love JoJo friday. Let's go.
>> ARTICLE
I want to take a moment to continue appreciating the FANTASTIC transitions this anime employs. They make me especially happy.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone make a Firefox wordfilter extension that changes Town to Duwang?
>> ARTICLE
That rock is a fine line between funny and creepy, those eyes man.     

Also The Hand is kind of confusing? It's hard to explain but when Okuyasu used the power on the empty space to close the gap between him and Josuke, shouldn't everything be closer instead of only Josuke? Anyway it's not that important, the stand is pretty cool either way.
>> ARTICLE
The music and action for the Okuyasu fight was on point.
Now I can't wait for next week, the next stand is one of my favorites and seeing how they handled this one just makes me want it more.
>> ARTICLE
The Hand is one of the coolest stand and has a fantastic design. Can't wait till next week with another one of my [favorite stands](/s "Bad Company")
>> ARTICLE
I'm a really big fan of The Hand. It's one of my favorite stands next to Vanilla Ice's stand. Something about erasing space is just awesome to me.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I never realized how big those little thingies on The Hand's hand are. It's kind gross the way it's squeezing one of them at the start, like some kind of huge blister or callus.
>> ARTICLE
That was insane
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain to me how Josuke defeated Okuyasu with those pots? I don't get what happened.
>> ARTICLE
Since The Hand cuts space and everything from the other end of the cut, gets pulled back towards the cut. Josuke positioned himself so that when The Hand cut the air, it would drag in the pots behind him.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!

I really like how they animated The Hand.

>> ARTICLE
Damn good episode. I'm glad they didn't make The Hand's fight a two parter, it was perfectly paced. Also I'm absolutely LOVING Part 4's use of transitions, holy shit its so satisfying to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Okuyasu's fight was two chapters long, dude. There was literally no way it was going to be a two parter. 
>> ARTICLE
Why didn't the pots fly off the first time he used The Hand :|?
>> ARTICLE
Worth noting that in the manga, they did actually fly off during the very first teleport. Josuke getting repeatedly teleported and punched was added in (I guess to make the fight a bit less of a joke).
>> ARTICLE
Maybe there wasn't enough force until he started using it repeatedly
>> ARTICLE
The Hand cuts space in an extremely linear fashion - the pots aren't directly behind Josuke, so they don't get pulled in. Before the final "cut," you can see Josuke pace over to his right so that he'll be in front of the potted plants before Okuyasu's next attack.
>> ARTICLE
Josuke wasn't behind those pots, remember he purposely walked behind them, pots flew late because it was behind Josuke.
>> ARTICLE
You can actually see the pots behind him prior to Okuyasu's final pull.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe from our perspective the pots look like they are behind Josuke but in the anime it's actually on the left side of Okuyasu since he just straight up punches Josuke and the latter is launched in a straight line behind, Josuke did walk to the left of Okuyasu.
>> ARTICLE
Perfect. Okuyasu's voice is fucking perfect.
>> ARTICLE
awesome episode, part 4 is really freaking cool and I get hyped every ep so far.
>> ARTICLE
I just assumed The World was Jonathan's Stand that awakened when DIO took his body.
>> ARTICLE
Jonathan's Stand is the Hermit Purple-like one that DIO used in very early Part 3.
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else notice how they changed the ending? I wonder if they are going to keep adding stuff into it as we go forward!
>> ARTICLE
While I thought the episode was enjoyable, something's been bothering me about the way the sound's been mixed: a lot of the time, the sound effects are louder than anything else that's being played. You could have a scene where the characters are talking with music in the background, then all of the sudden, Crazy Diamond appears and it almost sounds like my speakers are going to break.

Is anyone else experiencing the same thing?
>> ARTICLE
Huh? Didn't Dio get a Stand because he "possessed" Jonathan's body? I thought that was said in Part 3.

(Anime-only viewer)
>> ARTICLE
I was equally confused, but someone higher up explained it. Dio got his stand from the arrow and since he had Jonathan's body, that power transferred to the JoJo line as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you 
>> ARTICLE
so, technically the Joestars wouldn'd have had a stand if not for Dio?
I always thought either Hermit Purple or The World/Star Platinum were Jonathans original stand and Dio developed the other in addition to that (since DIO used some thorns at the early parts of Part 3), so technically the Joestars got their stand unlocked by Dio awakening his own stand, but i never thought that both stands were created by the bow and arrow and the Joestars originally never would have had stands to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it makes sense because Joseph's stand didn't awaken until he was much older, showing that he wasn't born with it.
>> ARTICLE
Not quite, Joseph and Jotaro got stands because DIO possessed Jonathan's body, stands are inherited through bloodlines so because DIO technically became a Jostar all of Jonathan (living) descendants developed stands
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, so if DIO hadn't gotten a Stand, none of the Joestars would've?
>> ARTICLE
[exactly](https://youtu.be/kzGAJeXc65w?t=1s)
>> ARTICLE
Exactly.
>> ARTICLE
Got it! Thanks a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. That's also why Star Platinum can stop time; Jotaro inherited an extremely similar Stand from DIO.
>> ARTICLE
Yup! In fact Stands earned through genes tend to be similar. You'll see this again with [Part 5 spoilers](/s "Gold Experience.")
>> ARTICLE
Wait what, how is [part 5](/s "Gold Experience") similar ?
>> ARTICLE
[Part 5 Spoilers](/s "It has the same color scheme as The World.")
>> ARTICLE
At this rate it seems like they want to pace the show at 4.5 chapters per episode give or take. That would fit into the 39 episodes. 

And after doing some quick math I'd say the halfway point would be Episode 20, and about Chapter 90 of the manga. Which fits really well as a cliffhanger because [Manga Spoiler](/s "It's right after Kira changes his appearance and is attempting to escape")
>> ARTICLE
Which is weird to me.

Part 4 is long than Part 3, but they seem to not be cutting ANYTHING. All scenes are still there, there is nothing left out in these first three episodes, so I don't understand how they will fit all that in just 39 episodes.

Maybe Part 3 had more episodes because they extended some scenes more. That's the only explanation I can get, since they seems to not going for cuts or arc removals.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely feel some of the stand fights in Part 3 could've been only one episode instead of 2 parters. That could be why.
>> ARTICLE
It might just be down to the show having better pacing. Especially when a full page of art can be expressed in a few seconds.
>> ARTICLE
Josuke and Koichi are under attack from toy soldiers, and Koichi laid an egg.

>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't the use of those names be free? I mean 'bad company' can't be protected to be used in all works. This is a work of fiction anyway, and a small platoon of toy soldiers should be allowed to be called that. 
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, *spoken* names are protected by things like parody. But you can't WRITE them. Hence why the audio can go through but the writing has to change.

Trademark is a whole different beast than copyright. A company has every right to protect how their trademarks, like band names, are associated with things, as that can lead to very real economic consequences to your brand. On top of that, if you just let people use your trademarks willy-nilly, you'll have *less* of a case to defend it in cases that *do* matter. 

This is, coincidentally, why Susan G. Komen sues the shit out of anyone for using their trademarks. Some shady company could end up using their logo to sell dodgy shit to "raise funds for cancer". Not saying they're a truly upstanding company, but there is merit to what they do beyond getting money.

JoJo is a soup of copyright problems anyways. Better to be safe then sorry.

Also IIRC Bad Company is copyrighted by EA(?)

[Koichi, did you lay this egg?](http://i.imgur.com/1u8PYFW.jpg)  
Many people are criticizing the name change to 'worse company'. I can understand that, but personally I had a good chuckle about that. With the original name clearly audible while the subtitles say 'worse', it's like a subtle middle finger to whoever's responsible for them having to change it.

Keicho's ultimate fate is currently unknown, so no update to the "Stand User Fate" counter.

Now it is:

"The fans can't wait for a teenager boy to lay an egg and pose near to it in the next intro!"

I'm so proud guys!

Speaking which: Yeah guys, Koichi wasn't really suitable to get a Stand, he would've died, but Josuke "cheated" the process with his powers. So yeah, congratulations Koichi, you cheated the Bow and Arrow trial!

Now let's see what mysteries Koichi's Egg hide.


>> ARTICLE
> Speaking which: Yeah guys, Koichi wasn't really suitable to get a Stand, he would've died, but Josuke "cheated" the process with his powers. So yeah, congratulations Koichi, you cheated the Bow and Arrow trial!

[Part 4, 5 and 6](/s "Actually, you don't really need to get stabbed with the arrow to gain a stand, a small cut is fine. I think that Keicho is shooting the arrow at people because he wants to see if they're tough enough to survive the shot or not. If Koichi really wasn't suitable to gain a stand he would've contracted Holly's illness and died, as explained in Part 5.")  
[TL;DR](/s "Koichi wasn't dying because he wasn't suitable, but because he got stabbed in his throat. It's already quite amazing that he survived for so much time with that wound.")

>> ARTICLE
I'm not wrong. Koichi survived because of Josuke's powers. If Koichi had the aptitude, he would've survived, like Angelo did. Aqua Necklace had no powers to prevent Angelo's demisse due his wound, but he survived, because that how the Arrow works. If the wound is fatal, the Arrow would avoid it and give you a Stand if you're up to it.

Koichi Stand is too weak to harm his life. There is no Holly scenario here.

And remember, FIRST AND FOREMOST, that Stands are manifestation of Willpower, and Koichi had NONE. How he is situable to get a Stand if he had zero Willpower?

TL;DR: Angelo wound was as fatal as Koichi's, and he survived. His body even shined when the arrow stuck him, and it didn't happened with Koichi. Koichi was too meek to get enough Willpower to win a Stand.

There is also other example of fatal Arrow shots in the series that gave Stand's , [Part 4](/s "Like Ratt. A Rat won't be able to survive being piearced by a Arrow no matter the scenario")

>> ARTICLE
[Major Part 4 Spoiler](/s "That's probably why Koichi is one of the few characters we see having a Stand that develops so much. Most people are already full of willpower which manifests as stand power as soon as they get their stand. Koichi's stand power develops up over time, which is why it changes forms thrice as he gains confidence and willpower.")

I've been looking forward to this fight ever since I started reading part   IV. **Bad Company**(this name is going to be in bold because I like the stand so much) is one of my favorite stands in JoJo and I'm going to go over what I like about it one by one.

**STAND NAME**: **Bad Company** as you've probably guessed, is a music reference to the band **Bad Company**. But **Bad Company** also released an album called **Bad Company**, which has a song in it called **Bad Company**. So the stand technically is three music references at once to the Band **Bad Company**, the album **Bad Company** and the song **Bad Company**. **Bad Company** is also an extremely fitting name for the stand ability. It's a group of soldiers being controlled by the villain Keicho. A **Bad Company** if you will.


**STAND DESIGN**: **Bad Company** is definitely one of the most unique stands at its introduction. It's a group of army soldiers with little guns and knives and tiny vehicles. That's not only adorable but cool as well. It reminds me of my childhood when I played with little army figures all the time.


**STAND ABILITY**: **Bad Company** is definitely one of the most awesome stands introduced so far. It's a group of little army men that seem harmless, until you realize it's versatility. Even though each individual soldier is less powerful than stands like crazy diamond, they make up for it with mass firepower. Unlike stands before, killing one soldier is not going to cripple them significantly and killing them doesn't affect the stand user that much. Coming with tanks and assault helicopter just add to the awesome and give it an extremely threatening punch. The stand is like your own little army, a merciless steel wall of death marching to your demise.

**Bad Company** is also one of the most unique stands Araki came up with. It's superpower is a group of little badass army soldiers and tanks. When I first read this part in the manga it blew my mind with how creative it was. I couldn't come with something this absurd if you gave me 20 years to come up with a unique power. It introduced a new type of stand: *The stand colony*. As you can see, they have the disadvantage of being rather small individually, but they do not transmit damage to the user, they're usually automatic, and their strength in numbers counteract the fact that each individual unit is weak. This stand requires a whole new way of fighting, as attacks against the stand itself is alot less effective, forcing you to attack the user directly. You'll see a few more of these type of stands later.

**Bad Company** is one of my favorite stands in JoJo. Everything about it is unique and awesome. It perfectly encompasses the bizarre awesomeness that is JoJo.
>> ARTICLE
There is another Stand that is a reference to a song, band and album. [Part 5 spoilers](/s "Black Sabbath, a reference to the song Black Sabbath on the album Black Sabbath by the band Black Sabbath. In addition the song speaks of a "Figure in Black" which sums up Black Sabbath's design.")
>> ARTICLE
Whats this "Bad Company" Stand?

Why not Evil Business?

Poor Koichi, all he wanted to do was say Yo to Angelo the rock, and find out who lives in the abandoned house. He got his neck stuck in a gate, struck by an arrow, dragged up stairs, attacked by a toy army, and laid an egg.

The soundtrack is fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
The name of the stand is Bad Company. But, because of copyright laws, Crunchyroll has to sub it as Worse Company.
>> ARTICLE
Was it intentionally a battlefield reference when it was written?
>> ARTICLE
it's a reference to a song
>> ARTICLE
Nope it was written well before bfbc, its a reference to bad company which released a song called bad company on their album bad company.
>> ARTICLE
I highly doubt it. This Part came out in 1995. It's a reference to the band, Bad Company.
>> ARTICLE
Oh lol I thought maybe this part was newer.
>> ARTICLE
Lol you have no idea how old JoJo is. Right now its at 8 parts, with 8 ongoing. 8 started being written around 2011 ish? Part 7 alone took from 2004-2011 (but that's b/c part 7 is monthly, not weekly like parts 1-6).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know. I just wish they went with something better than Worse.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, at least it isn't Zenyatta/Mondatta.
>> ARTICLE
As not as good as it is, I can at least give Zenyatta/Mondatta a pass because Zenyatta Mondatta is the name of an album by The Police, Worse Company is just so bad.
>> ARTICLE
You'll never be in Worse Company than with Bad Company.

And yes, Koichi laid an egg. No dignity.

Also, it seems like Josuke learned something from playing Doom and Quake: bullets are far more dangerous than rockets.

But overall, I felt like this episode was a tad bit slower if compared to the previous ones. I thought we would resolve the whole Nijimura thing, but it seems like we'll have the aftermath in the next episode, just like we did with Angelo.
>> ARTICLE
Nijimura Brothers is one of the longest sections in the Part 4. I'm thinking they'll split the next fight with this section in the next episode.

After everyone's finished watching this episode, I have two questions for Anime-only watchers:

1) Did you predict what Keicho's stand was going to be?

2) What you think of Stands now? Are they worse than Hamon?
>> ARTICLE
I really miss Hamon, that's all I'm going to say.

I've heard that it has relevance in later parts somehow from friends who read the manga, but I can't begin to imagine how. Either way, I'm excited. 
>> ARTICLE
1. Dinosaur.

2. I liked HAMON but Stands are so much more versatile. They give every character a very unique superpower which they use in creative ways. So far Joseph is still my favourite, though. Because he was creative even without Stands and I loved how much of a goof and bullshitter he was. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Hamon fights were more interesting than Stand fights, but that might just be me. It's kinda silly when you think about it; Stands are a way more original idea than Hamon, which is basically a combination of martial arts and ki control, but they are worse when it comes to action and close-up fights.
>> ARTICLE
Probably because Hamon is ridiculously versatile on it's own while Stands are varied but individually limited, so you can usually guess approximately how the fights will go.
>> ARTICLE
> 1) Did you predict what Keicho's stand was going to be?
> 

~~I thought it would probably be something worthless at first so somewhat spot on.~~ Wrong person evidently.

Nope I had no clue.

> 2) What you think of Stands now? Are they worse than Hamon?

Love em. Bad company may be one of the coolest stands ever.

Koichi=Josuke's tiny friend
>> ARTICLE
Whoops fixed. 
>> ARTICLE
1) I was expecting some wort of scared looking creature based on his super freaked out reaction while they were saying it'll have to do with his personality

2) I think that I liked hamon better, but I do still enjoy the stands; I wish hamon still played a part though. Both of them allow for the most ridiculous asspulls and bullshit though, and that's all I'm asking for

Edit: Side Note: Bad Company was a really cool stand too and I quite enjoyed it
>> ARTICLE
I've always preferred Stands to Hamon, ever since P3 introduced them. One thing that I really like about them is the protagonists and antagonists are now on somewhat equal terms. Like in P1 and 2 you never saw Hamon vs Hamon. Also I prefer them in the fact I think they are better than the villains powers in both 1 and 2. I mean the Pillar Men had some really strange powers if you think about it. At least Stands add somewhat of a consistency.

Besides wasn't Hamon only effective against vampires? That can only go so far.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was going to be a woman because in the intro you can see that in one of the scenes, Keicho's shadow is a woman's silhouette.  There's also the outro where he's in a screwed up room with two floating women. 
>> ARTICLE
That outro shot is from a scene in the fight after the current one, if you're curious
>> ARTICLE
1) Nope! I figured it would be similar to Strength, in that his Stand was manipulating the house itself or some such. I did not call a toy army, but this is my favorite stand now *_*

2) I love Stands, and I have from the beginning. They're basically the whole reason I got into JoJo in the first place. I didn't care for Part 1 or 2 that much, to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
I started to like stands like halfway through stardust crusaders. Hamon was cool enough but it would have gotten old, and the show would be way less creative. Shadow clones and rasengans are only cool for so long.
>> ARTICLE
Stands are cool as fuck. I really like that they're not all just humanoids with powers like the Stardust Crusaders (not counting Hermit Purple). 
>> ARTICLE
Hey now, don't forget Hol Horse and his... gun.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, some of them are eggs. With powers, presumably.
>> ARTICLE
Did you see it glowing? Egg confirmed for ultimate stand.
>> ARTICLE
1) When the first attack of Worst Bad Not the Best Company came, I audibly said, 'Toy Soldiers?!' I'm so glad it ended up being that, and their uniform design is really cool. Not what I expected from his personality but I really like it

2) While I don't like that Hamon was pushed to the wayside, I think Stands are fucking dope and are a far more iconic and flexible concept. My guess is that the two powers somehow connect but maybe that's wishful thinking. But when you think about it Jojo probably wouldn't be the legendary series it is without the Stands (not saying that it wouldn't be great without them)
>> ARTICLE
1) ~~I just realized this is about evil brother dude and not Koichi, but my answer is the same.~~ Absolutely not. Jojo is unpredictable.

2) Stands are awesome! I loved P1 and P2, but you can't do as much with Hamon as you can with stands. I don't think the current show would be as fun without them.

I was iffy on stands in the first  16-20 so episodes of Stardust Crusaders. I don't hate monster-of-the-week formats, but some of the first episodes were really, really boring. It wasn't the fault of stands in particular. The fact that I enjoyed P2 a hell of a lot more for a good portion of SC soured me to them for awhile. The Egypt arc completely sold me, though. I really started liking stands near Death 13, actually, iirc.

Anyway, now I LOVE stands. They're always ridiculous and creative, and that's perfect for JJBA. I'm fairly confident Part 4 is going to be my favorite part.
>> ARTICLE
I can never predict stands. This show is like, what's a word for something unpredictable and unusual? It's like a weird adventure. Or a strange adventure. Maybe even an confusing adventure. 

But I was kind of expecting something like The Hand or Shiny Zirconium. A humanoid stand with some dumb power to like, flip houseplants and control staplers.
>> ARTICLE
1) Alright since Koichi was researching all the things going on in the city, I think his stand will let him see into the past. So if he goes to a crime scene he could kind of rewind time and see what happened. I have no idea what it would look like, but I'd like to see a studious velociraptor. It would have a monocle and everything.

2) I like the stands. They have a ton of variety, but I would like to see Hamon come back. Even if it's not directly for fighting like [Part 2](/s "when Joseph catches himself with the chain of icicles.")
>> ARTICLE
> he goes to a crime scene he could kind of rewind time and see what happened

[](/s "nah that's stupid, there can't be a stand like that")
>> ARTICLE
Never saw that stand coming, it's random but it's fun.

As for stands that's kind of what they are. The potential is endless so it can be anywhere from cool to silly, there's no rules. It can go further than Hamon but at the same time I'm scared of the monster of the week format like in SC1. 
>> ARTICLE
The "stand of the week" format continues throughout the series, but the big difference in the later parts is that A) the stands themselves are much cooler, and 2) they're mostly plot relevant. SC's stands of the week were just kinda there for the gang to fight, whereas DiU+ all typically lead into one another, or at least there's a lot more substance connecting them. The fight with Angelo leads into Josuke and Koichi looking into the house which leads to them fighting The Hand which leads them into the Bad Company fight, so on so forth.
>> ARTICLE
Monster of the week is fine as long as it's integrated into the story fine. That wheel of fortune episode was bad though lmao. 
>> ARTICLE
1) Whatever it is, I'm sure it's gonna be *egg-cellent*.  
[](#whowouldathunkit)  
In all seriousness, I'm guessing some kinda bird like Magician's Red? Phoenix? Dinosaur? Dragon? Yoshi? Platypus? Seriously, if that thing's a dinosaur I'm gonna lose my shit. I love me some dinosaurs.    
  
2) At the start of Stardust Crusaders, I was confused as to how Stands came to be after Hamon was so prominent in the first JoJo arcs. [Stardust Crusaders](/s "Same with how Dio just magically popped out of the chest that Erina used to escape, but that's a different matter entirely.") With this season explaining their origins, it does answer that uncertainty I had, which I like.  
  
Apart from the confusion, I do like the concept (even if I wished Hamon still had some more prominence alongside Stands). As it is now, I'm loving the new Stands from this season and I can't wait to see what Koichi's Stand can do.
>> ARTICLE
> I love me some dinosaurs

I think you might like part 7. Don't worry, 2022 is just around the corner.

>1) Did you predict what Keicho's stand was going to be?

Since it's an egg, common sense says some kind of bird or dinosaur. But since it's JJBA, it could be a car or Index S3. You can never tell with this show and I love it.

Edit: whoops, I mixed up the names. But my comment still *stands* for Koichi.
>> ARTICLE
If you watch koichi during the op, his shadow is a guy with long, flowing hair. I hope that's actually a dinosaur with a wig.
>> ARTICLE
It'll clearly spawn Accelerator, the stand to rule all others.
>> ARTICLE
You're mixing up Keicho and Koichi, Keicho is the older Nijimura brother.
>> ARTICLE
Dammit! I didn't remember the bro's name, pardon my fail _
>> ARTICLE
>Index S3

JoJo is absurd at times, but I think even that's too far.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I didn't like Stands at first and how they pushed Hamon off to the side, but they definitely started getting better towards the end of Stardust Crusaders.

I originally thought they were a part of Hamon too before knowing much of JoJo. When Zeppeli was thinking of how much potential Johnathan had when observing him back in Part 1, I thought that had something to do with forming the "spirit punch ghost" I kept hearing about.
>> ARTICLE
Its pretty easy to tell that Araki was hesitant to go crazy with stands before egypt in part 3. A car, a fishcreature, a strong bug, an evil puppet, a "be careful what you wish for" scenario. But he definitely broke out of that early on. And trust when I say it just gets better and better as the series goes on. The part 8 manga has a stand that just caused a character to get sucked down the drain. 
>> ARTICLE
I recall in part 3 Stands were introduced as "Ghost ripples", both involving a great deal of perseverance mentally. And in a way, Jonathan eventually kinda got a stand alongside his Hamon prowess, at the time Dio and the Joestar bloodline got as well.
>> ARTICLE
Bad Company is almost as bad of a company as EA. Almost.
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait for [Battlefield: Worse Company](http://i.imgur.com/weoIDLq.jpg)

Did he forget he could bust through the walls to escape? Sure it's the second floor but its possible.
>> ARTICLE
But then he'd have left Koichi all alone with Nijimura.
>> ARTICLE
He could have still done it after he rescued him
>> ARTICLE
He didn't forget, his plan after he healed Koichi was to [smash the windows and jump out of the house](http://i.imgur.com/NglTc0k.png). Bad Company backed the two of them up against a wall that led further into the house. That's why they were trapped there.
>> ARTICLE
Calm down there Joseph, no need to always use the family secret technique.
>> ARTICLE
Another episode, another creative Stand. Part 4 wants to be my favorite season so bad. Only nitpick is CR changing it to Worse Company, when they clearly said 'Bad Company', but I'll survive. Can't wait to see Koichi's Stand.

Shoutout to Josuke for turning Okuyasu into a model with his Stand. I'm loving him as the protag! Not even Joseph reached this level so quickly and he's my favorite Jojo, for now anyways.

>> ARTICLE
I'm expecting a fan resub with the proper names before the end of the day. 
>> ARTICLE
They have to change it for liscencing issues. The mangaka is the one who came up with all the alternate names at least.

If that's the case, that gave me some solace.

I'll get used to it soon. Even better if he chose it.

Another GUREATO episode. Get ready, anime-only folks, for the trademark-safe names. Crazy/Shining Diamond and Bad Company becoming Worse Company is just the tip of the iceberg... [Part 7 manga spoilers](/s "just get ready for some Filthy Acts at a Reasonable Price"). 

For real though, it can be a bit distracting hearing/reading different things, but I gotta give the translation team props for trying to keep the names relevant and clever.

This part's OST is quickly becoming my favorite in the entire series. I can't wait to hear [Name of the main villain](/s "Kira's") theme. 

While watching this I realized I had forgotten just how much of an asshole Okuyasu's brother is, like damn dude, chill.


>Worse Company 

Lmao, that name is great.


This was another really great episode, DavidPro is really doing an amazing job with this part so far.
>> ARTICLE
Good thing about the soundtrack is that it builds up the general sense of dread and mystery in subtle ways.

Reminds me of how they used the music in Persona 4 videogame. Funny thing is, I have a suspicion that Persona 4 with its 'town murder mystery' kind of pooled inspiration from Part 4 of Jojo.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget the fact that Personas in those games are literally Stands.

And both first entries involve masks that turn the wearers into monsters with ice powers.

[Part 4](/s "That could actually work really well , all they would have to do is make it ramp up a bit, and get more tense to fit the mood of certain scenes" )

The OST with machine guns making a beat was *spot on* and it fit really well.

JoJo OSTs never disappoint!
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if you are aware but it's confirmed that this part will have  39 episodes. (13 Blu-ray releases 3 episodes each).
>> ARTICLE
So is it confirmed that they're cutting out some non essential story arcs? Because I can't see a way for the entirety of DiU to fit into 39 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so, [Part 4](/s "you can see all the stand users in the OP.")

[Part 4](/s "But what if they cut Rohan burning his house down?")

They can't cut that arc without cutting the back arc. A lot of seemingly useless arcs all are important with the grand scheme of things.

No please, that's like, my second favorite arc of this part :(

It's so good... :(

[](/s "Mikitaka") is in the OP too, so i doubt it will be cut.

it might be that this season has 39 episodes, but that this part is two seasons like stardust crusaders

Given how strictly David Productions is sticking to the source material, I have a hard time imagining them cutting out any of the chapters. Even the non essential arcs serve as cool down chapters between the action.

~~Bad~~ Worse Company fight was done really well I think. Crazy Diamond's repair ability is just too good. Very excited to see [Part 4 mango](/s 'Echoes next week hopefully')

In that case would [Part 4 manga](/s 'RHCP appear the same week, or will it probably appear next week do you think?')

[Manga](/s "RHCP has to be next week, for sure. I feel like they'll stretch the Nijimura father reveal/RHCP appearance out to fill an entire episode, but I really hope they don't. So The Lock will either show up late next week, with Echoes being 2 weeks out, or they'll somehow squeeze Echoes into next week.")
>> ARTICLE
Loved the fight, both in the manga and a lot more in the anime. And god damn Koichi can't catch a fucking break, [Spoilers] (/s "sadly for him it's only gonna get worse")

Bad Company is my favorite stand out of everything else. Something about having a personal army like that as a stand just...I love it

[Spoilers] (/s "I was positive that they'd show their dad this episode, guess we gotta wait another week to see that...thing, also possibly Red Hot Chili Pepper briefly" )

#For Newcomers and non-manga readers:

Feel free to discuss the events of the episode and your conclusions/speculations below (though bear in mind to spoiler tag predictions). It doesn't have to be serious. I will personally try to respond to everyone given that I'm a newcomer myself.

I will not be forcing anyone to participate in this, I'm only seeking to create a safe zone for newcomers to discuss in without external influence. 

Manga readers, if you must participate, please refrain from confirming or denying anything to come. We're all here because we're hyped, no need to sell us on Part 4 after we watched 3 of them.

Also, due to Jojo's air time, I can usually catch it about an hour afterwards, but I'll be posting this the moment the thread comes out.

>> ARTICLE
Wait...Did Okuyasu just get...killed? Well, I sure never saw that one coming.

A machine-gun stand? I think I'm in love

Alright... Blondie has a huge advantage. But his stand doesn't seem super OP like I expected. Josuke should be able to beat it. The problem is Koichi lying there dying.

Yeah...Everyone and their mother know Crazy Diamond's weakness by now. Hell, Josuke should start handing out fliers.

Okuyasu suddenly turns Bro... I approve.

Are these... Toy soldiers?? Ahahahha... His stand is a bunch of toy soldiers...And Helicopters... And Tanks... Well, this is hilarious

So, Bad Company got butchered to Worse company? Why?

So, there was a method behind the madness. He wants a specific stand to come out. Maybe Za Warudo?

All that pressure on poor Koichi. And he was so constipated with pain he laid an egg?

Damn, I wanted to see it hatch. Please be a badass stand, please be badass stand, *pleaaaaaaaase be a badass stand!*

Wait... A villain who's smart enough not to insult his hair? Holy shit, this is revolutionary!!

Even landmines?? And missiles?? Haha.. Do these come with a training camp, too?

Josuke with the yoga intimidation. And it **WORKED!!** 

He freaking rebuilt the missiles. Aw hell yeah!

This episode is my favorite so far. Great stands and even greater uses for them.
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah...Everyone and their mother know Crazy Diamond's weakness by now. Hell, Josuke should start handing out fliers.

I think he said that to Okuyasu just to be a nice guy that Josuke is.

Well, Okuyasu isn't the smartest person, but even he noticed the obvious, that "why you didn't heal yourself, Josuke?". A more smarter villain wouldn't need to ask to reach a logical conclusion.  =P
>> ARTICLE
Well... I can count on one hand the number of smart villains in Jojo, so it's all good.
>> ARTICLE
Anyway, one thing I REALLY liked when I first saw this chapter on the manga is how much detail they go into explaining how to Summon a Stand to a new Stand user.

Before we didn't had a character who wasn't a Stand user and turned into one mid adventure. Holly started Stardust Crusaders as a Stand user (Remember, she was able to see Star Platinum and Magician's Red, while the cops wasn't at the prision), so it's nice to have someone like Koichi discovering how Stand works, how to summon them, their rules (Like, "Damage taken by your Stand is also taken by you") and other things.

It came one part late? Well, it did. Naturally would be better if they showed Jotaro discovering these things, but I guess Koichi was the most situable one to serve for this role.
>> ARTICLE
I'm trying my best not to compare the two parts, because honestly, Part 4 is already winning hard.
>> ARTICLE
Most people consider part 4 miles ahead of part 3.

Part 3 is honestly my second least favorite part in jojo.
>> ARTICLE
Bad Company may be one of my most favourite stands to date. It's like a childhood dream come true seeing all those army men, Apaches and tanks come to life. 
>> ARTICLE
Same here... It was just so random but so awesome. (Jojo basically).

This definitely has me excited for the newer stands. I just really really hope Koichi's stand is powerful. ^^^^Hatch ^^^^a ^^^^dragon ^^^^pls
>> ARTICLE
Well that stand was pretty fun, cool concept and I didn't see it coming at all. Was wondering if it was more bringing toys to life or does he have a finite mini army?

But wow Crazy Dimaond is sneaky, maybe I should write it down since I forget that his powers go beyond healing sometimes :p
>> ARTICLE
It's a miniature army of toy soldiers, complete with tanks, helicopters and landmines. The numbers of soldiers are finite but they pack a lot of firepower.
>> ARTICLE
Got to love such a versitile Stand. Better yet is when given to the Protagonist.

As much I love Jotaro and Star Platinum, we got to agree that Star Platinum wasn't much versitile on it's powers. It just punched things really hard. At least the Time Stop made it more interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I just thought, if he is bringing toy soldiers to life then Josuke is damn lucky that Keicho isn't a Warhammer 40k player. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking they have a respawn timer. Like, they die one day, and respawn the next.

Seems stupid having a finite stand.
>> ARTICLE
> Was wondering if it was more bringing toys to life or does he have a finite mini army?

I've always thought of it as the army men themselves were his Stand. They were all gone when he got taken out by the missiles, right? If they were real, there would just be a bunch of lifeless toys around Josuke, right?
>> ARTICLE
Worse (Bad?) Company was a really awesome Stand concept! Way better than some of the ones from Stardust crusaders. Love it!

And I am to assume Koichi cheated the Bow and Arrow thing? Since he was dying. Can't wait to see what is in that egg!
>> ARTICLE
Kinda, yeah. He was supposed to die, but Josuke healed the wound before he bled out. Therefore, he survives to unlock his stand ability. Unfortunately since he's, well, Koichi, his stand is a fucking egg.
>> ARTICLE
The Stand is officially called Bad Company, named after [the band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Company) of the same name.

Crunchyroll have to rename the stands to avoid copyright (For example, "Shining Diamond" is actually called "Crazy Diamond" after the song 'Shine on You Crazy Diamond' by Pink Floyd). The names they use are not the best.
>> ARTICLE
The arrow just wasn't programmed very well. It kills you if you're unworthy, and it gives you a stand if it fails to kill you. Nobody tested for edge-cases like healing abilities.
>> ARTICLE
Speaking as a programmer, it sounds like something that'd happen if the arrow creator was a programmer.
>> ARTICLE
There's also the assumption of people DO die when they are killed...

*tsk tsk* cover the edge cases guys
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader, and for quite a long time since I last read part 4, this never occurred to me. 

Never thought that Koichi "cheated" to get a Stand. 
>> ARTICLE
Battle company would have been better. then at least it sounds like what the characters are saying.
>> ARTICLE
Worst Company is the first step were taking into going full-on Duwang :^)
>> ARTICLE
I kinda guessed that Koichi would end up getting a stand, kinda due the opening, cant wait to see what it hatches in to though.
Regardless, this was, again a great episode, and a great fight. 

EDIT: Wrong 'k' name, oops..
>> ARTICLE
*Koichi. Keicho is Okuyasu's brother.
>> ARTICLE
Well, like Koichi said, you don't need to remember his name.

Man, I'm really loving Josuke as a protagonist and especially him fighting using tactics and brains instead of brute forcing through sheer power. 

[End of the fight as a webm](https://my.mixtape.moe/erurpu.webm). Had to make it.

Once again, this are one of the fights made even better than in the Manga, like The Hand was on the last episode.

The Soundtrack really made all the difference. Such an awesome moment, indeed.

Hello! During the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure rewatch I've been tallying all of the references Jojo's Bizarre Adventure makes to music. I am going to be continuing that trend in this new season!

* Josuke's Stand, Crazy Diamond (called "Shining Diamond" in the Crunchyroll subs) is named after the Pink Floyd song, *Shine On You Crazy Diamond*.

* Anjuro "Angelo" Katagiri's nickname comes from *Angelo Badalamenti*, a composer for Twin Peaks.

* Angelo's stand's name is *Aqua Necklace*. It's unknown what exactly this is referencing, but it might be the album *Aqua* by Asia.

* Okuyasu's stand's name is *The Hand*, a reference to the band called... *The Band*.

* Keicho's stand, "Worse Company", is *actually* named *Bad Company*, a reference to the band of the same name.

**Reference Count: 5**

Worse Company.... That censorship is just Bad. But I can live with it.

Nothing really stood out to me as different or changed this episode. The suspense of Koichi trying to summon his Stand only for it to end up being an egg was pretty funny.

Alright boys, anime only watcher who has no idea what happens past this point, so consider these live reactions!

Oh hey, scar-face got up straight away. Thought that would be later in the episode.

It appears our new opponent has mind bullets, and that scar-face is going to have several hundred new scars. God damn this guy is dumb. 

He's also dead, apparently. Also I don't think they're actually brothers, judging by this guys complete lack of a reaction.

Hopefully only one episode left until koichi's pose gets updated with his stand and he stops looking so silly.

Wow, that brother is a jerk. Not that suprising, considering it's JoJo, but it be nice to see a normal sibling relationship for once. 

Holy shit this guy is so dumb, do you have no concept of tact? Maybe its the fact he has such an OP stand that makes him dumb, because he never has to exercise tactics.

Well this doesn't look like a trap at all.

Something about Josuke speaks to me. "This is blatently a trap, but I guess I'll set it off anyway!"

Nice move by The Hand, guess scar-face isn't a complete dick, which makes sense because he's in the OP.

Alright, Koichi's back up, but still seems stand free for the moment.

WAS THAT THE MILITARY?

TOY SOLDIERS? THAT'S THIS GUYS STAND?

With parachutes apparently. Fucking araki...

IS THIS A REFRENCE TO BAD COMPANY? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

Oh, bad company the band, not bad company the battlefield game, gotcha.

and they have helicopters. This might be the greatest stand yet.

and tanks. AND KOICHI CAN SEE THEM! Welcome to reality, little guy.

How is he doing that pose? It's not like his stand is actually holding him up, he's just floating. I suppose after that Jotaro Dio fight it's kind of nitpicky to complain, but still.

Unsuprisingly, older bro has a secret plan. Suprisingly, he's not giving it away. I guess that trick only works so many times.

Koichi's stand is...an egg? Interesting. Wonder what it does?

Is he delibrately pushing the hair button?!

Never mind, he's not as dumb as his brother. Can that egg can hatch if it's withdrawn?

And Koichi has theme music. Sounds ~~good~~ Gureeto da ze, too.
welp, RIP Koichi. You tried.

It appears people haven't learned what Josuke's victory face looks like yet. Might be something to work on, because those eye's gleam with the light of *just as planned*.

HE UNEXPLODED THE MISSILES? INGENIOUS! This is a pretty solid all purpose stand.

Aaand that looks like a wrap for todays episode. Didn't feel as solid as the others, but that might be due to constant pausing to write this. If you all enjoyed this, I'll see about doing it for the rest of the season! See you next friday!

Koichi, did you lay this egg?

The fact that they subbed Bad Ccompany as Worst Company gave me a laugh. The stand itself is pretty neat.

The name Worse Company is worse than Bad Company. Not that Bad Company was all that bad.

This episode was *gureato daze.*

Bad Company changed to Worse Company. Not too bad of a change.

Okayasu's bro is a dick.

His Stand is those little toy soldiers? Quite unique. Now that I think about it having little toy soldiers fits the Stand name.

These sound effects are still deafening.

I'm glad they didn't stall with revealing that Koichi probably has a stand now.

Koichi laid an egg!

What came first, the Koichi or the egg?
>> ARTICLE
That seemed like a really quick episode,   
Worse Company is a terrible change. He even has bad company written on his collar somewhat.

Interested in what Koichi's stand is/ will be called and looks like Josuke + the bow and arrow is free stand users without the risk.
>> ARTICLE
Wait so as a first time anime only watcher, why do the subs have these changes? Licensing issues or something? Cause you can clearly hear them saying "Bad Company" and "Crazy Diamond" and stuff, so I don't see why changing the subs would help much...
>> ARTICLE
it's licensing, names are changed because DP is a Japanese company that abides by Japanese laws, Crunchyroll abides by American laws, which are a lot stricter.
>> ARTICLE
First time watching it myself but I know a bit about these issues and they are only going to get more pronounced, it's completely down to copyright. The original Japanese script comes under Japanese copyright laws which allow them to use those names but since the subs are done by crunchyroll which is American they fall under a separate system.

For the same reason in the games that are released for JoJo characters like Jean Pierre Polnareff has his last name changed to Eiffel.
>> ARTICLE
It's mostly just to humour the copyright lawyers because no-one told Araki about copyright laws when he was writing JoJo ~~and as an immortal vampire, he is above such things~~ (no, it doesn't get better in terms of that).  

 You see, all of the Stands from this point on are directly named after songs or bands. For example, Bad Company is named after the 70s band [Bad Company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww5GXbk58R0) and Crazy Diamond is named after the Pink Floyd song [Shine On You Crazy Diamond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UXircX3VdM). As this infringes on copyright laws in the West, CR had to change them, since it's much easier than dealing with lawyers and potentially stopping any official release of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure on this side of the Pacific.
>> ARTICLE
Prince (RIP) was one of the main reasons we have this issue since he was very litigious over the use of his intellectual property.
>> ARTICLE
Wait was it him personally or his label?
>> ARTICLE
Prince personally had a big thing about copyright. He wouldn't allow any of his songs, not even covers he sang, to be on YouTube at all.

He also prevented the US release of a JoJo Part 5 game, because they couldn't change Gold Experience (JoJo's Stand) enough to satisfy him.

Dude, Worse Company is probably one of the coolest stands we've seen in any part that's been animated so far.

It wad a bit on the slow side, but the interesting stand and creative battle kept me fully engaged.

I already consider this better than part 3, and I can't wait for more. 
>> ARTICLE
Animated Bad Company was  satisfying and I really liked the OST that played during the fight.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Worse Company was named after the song Bad Company by Five Finger Death Punch. Didn't think the name was an actual band. Also because FFDP has guns and their mascot in soldier gear.

That's a cover of the song by Bad Company.

Oh that's pretty cool, didn't know FFDP's was a cover of this song. Actually like it quite better.

This part of the manga was written in the early 90s. That band wasn't even formed yet. 

Don't expect any semi modern references for until maybe whatever jojo anime is airing 2019 or 2020

I still dislike the intro, but I'm more than excited for the story. 

Having not read any of this arc, every scene is fucking killer. I marked out at the missiles.
>> ARTICLE
Soooooo, I marathoned the stardust crusaders which I think were referred to as part 3 and 4?   I really enjoyed the style of the show but when I watch this, i feel like something is out of place.  maybe the setting doesn't feel as serious as the other shows did, or maybe the amount of times they change up the colors which yes they did in the other shows but it feels like they do it way way more in this season.


On top of that Jojo seems really relaxed in the OP rather than serious looking.  I don't know, I think Im rambling at this point.  I really like that OP song though.  Hope they make an extended version of it some time
>> ARTICLE
Nice Episode and a very cool stand but I can't help but wonder, what's with all the auras? They are so distracting and uneccessary.

I think it's something specific to Part 4, for the most part anyways. Araki just decided to give people auras for this Part.

You'd have to talk to the mods about that since this is posted by a bot. I assume it automatically chooses the MAL title.

>> ARTICLE
Can't say there's much hope for that man's legal career if he can't even read the evidence, smh
>> ARTICLE
As DeForrest Kelly would say: "Dammit Jim, I'm an Engineer, not a Defense Attorney!"

Although I *did* do Mock Trial back in high school. Fun times, but I was always frustrated by the lack of evidence to use. The NYS Bar was never as thorough as I wanted them to be with the cases. I mean, the current high-school level case isn't even an actual trial, it's a criminal hearing. And apparently the person from the Bar who co-ordinates the Mock Trial tournament wasn't even aware of that until I brought it to her attention.
>> ARTICLE
Ho man, thanks for reminding me of my high school trial

Shit was tight on my end. I feel like the limited evidence kinda made things a bit more realistic and made you have to focus more on inferences. 
>> ARTICLE
The focus on inferences thing can kind of backfire if the cases aren't constructed well, though. I remember one case we won the trial decision on where my summation basically did Phoenix's thing of using implication from the evidence to put the blame on one of the other side's witnesses. We won by points too on that trial, which was nice.

Still, my favorite moments were the ones where a witness makes a small error that invalidates their entire testimony. I still remember the trial where one of the prosecution witnesses, for a case where the crime was set in Queens, testified that she witnessed everything happen in Brooklyn. The next words out of my mouth after she finished her statement were "No further questions, Your Honor."

Guess what I brought up in summation for that trial?
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, fucking witnesses. One of the witnesses for the other team was a very inattentive stoner (who probably came to trial high) and literally couldn't remember his own name. I hope we won that trial...

I remember in another mock trial I was the shop teacher witness and I straight up looked up how to work some of the machinery mentioned (even though it was barely relevant to the case) just in case. The prosecution tried to ask me how to work it just to throw me off and I threw it right back in their face. It was beautiful. 
>> ARTICLE
> One of the witnesses for the other team was a very inattentive stoner (who probably came to trial high) and literally couldn't remember his own name.

You think that's bad? My first year, our top attorney couldn't remember the names of *any* of the witnesses. And apparently he had been doing that for the whole time he'd been with the team. Still won rounds though since apart from that he was a damn good attorney. And seeing witnesses turn the tables back on cross examiners is always tons of fun.

That dreaded Japanese cold if I remember right. Anime don't mess around when they say "but you'll catch a cold!" Apparently the cold virus variant in Japan is much deadlier than it is elsewhere.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm wondering what they will do too. She was perfect for the role too
>> ARTICLE
She sure was.

Likewise, I wonder how they will deal with the fact that Matsuki voiced Lailah in Tales of Zestiria, which is getting a anime next year.

She died too young, with no one to replace her. :(
>> ARTICLE
I may have to stop playing it in English now, even if Lailah is Rom from Neptunia, Mami from Madoka, and Satsuki from Kill la Kill.

She's definitely missed :(
>> ARTICLE
Oh, she's Rom in the English dub.  
Neptunia is one of the few games I like to hear in English.  
IMO, Neptune's English VA kicks ass, and might be better than the JP VA. Compa too.  
Iris Heart though, JP all the way!

I wish Matsuki had a protog to take over her roles like Lupin the third's first VA, Yamada Yasuo had.  
He stated that he wanted Kurita Kanichi to take over the role if he died, and Kurita did.  
Kurita really sounds like Yamada did, so Lupins voice didn't really change much, which is good.

It's a spin-off from the original Muv-Luv VNs, just like TE is.

I'm saying this mostly because I want people to try it, since it's more like the OG VNs, and not like TE(or more like TEs first 2 episodes).

Rewrite is hopefully gonna be amazing.  
We have Tanaka Romeo onboard, so I have moderate hopes for it.
>> ARTICLE
> Why do you have Schwarzesmarken as a Total Eclipse spin-off?

MAL had it labelled that way. Fixed it

They were making some pretty ballsy statements. I remember reading a TL that went something like "the anime will be the ultimate play-through of the game"

Lol what?

So, either it will be amazing or it will fail so hard it will be the next Tsukihime.  
I hope they know what they are talking about.  
Some staff are quite good, but 8-bit itself worries me, Comet Lucifer wasn't good, though Grisaia no Rakuen was quite nice.

Yeah, MAL ain't a super reliable source, I don't know why many believe it is(not directing this at you).

yeah I left a lot of their "information" out, that one just slipped thru because I know pretty much nothing about the Muv-Luv franchise.

It's fine.

If you like mecha or sci-fi and don't have a problem with lots and lots of reading, then I suggest you try the VNs when they come out.  
I honestly think they are one of the best stories in fiction.  
A wild ride indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I'm planning on playing them when they come out. I started on Katawa Shoujo and Grisaia a couple months ago, and went ahead and bought a bunch of others like Saya no Uta and the new Clannad release.

Oh nice. I hope you like 'em.

To add to your list, you should try Ourai no Gahkthun, an amazing Steampunk VN.  
The writing and TL quality is amazing in that one.  
And if you liked Yumiko from from Grisiaia, then you might enjoy listening to Neon from Gahkthun, they share VA. 

Btw, do you use VNDB? It has a lot of info in VNs.  
Here's the page for [Gahkthun](https://vndb.org/v11033).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah VNDB has some pretty good info. Saved me a bit of grief regarding 18+ titles on Steam.

Yeah Yumiko's route was fun, its always nice to watch the ice queens melt. Amane and Sachi's routes were probably my favorites though. I've been taking it easy on VNs lately though.. bad endings are some of the most disturbing things I've ever experienced, I get shaken up just thinking about them
>> ARTICLE
Have you started Saya yet?  
That one requires being "okay" with really fucked up things.  
I totally recommend it though.

Amane's route was my favorite. Yumiko's was probably my least liked one, but Yumiko as a character was great.  
Grisaia was/is very good, I liked it enough to spend 500 USD on the kickstarter, so, yeah. I like it.

I think zero can stand on its own pretty well. Just if you haven't seen any fairy tail at all (at least some of the first anime) you won't know why some of the characters are important.

I doubt it, it's a prequel manga so if you've seen a good portion of the anime, youre probably fine. The current arc ends right before the start of Zero, and I saw someone post saying it's the perfect spot to put the adaption in as a flashback arc.

Should mean that the anime will have plenty of manga chapters to work with too, by the time Zero is done

Didn't know KyoAni was behind Koe no Katachi. Was already interested but hearing KyoAni just skyrocketed it. Seeing how well KyoAni have done the last few years, it's safe to say they'll do pretty well with the material. 
>> ARTICLE
the animation itself might be pretty good but the material might flop. 

I don't know if KyoAni doesn't like it they will just butcher it to be more appealing as they do with most series. 

Honestly its either gonna be great or its gonna be shit. I dont think there will be a middle ground
>> ARTICLE
the source material is my favorite manga. i'm very interested in seeing how kyoani will compress 64 chapters into a movie. 

i get the feeling that the movie *will* turn out well, but people who enjoyed the source material will inevitably complain. They will have to cut out a significant amount of content simply because of time constraints.

I'm pretty sure the movie will do great, they can definitely cut some stuff from the manga if I recall correctly it was somewhat slow sometimes

>a crowdfunded 1 episode OVA

yeah no
>> ARTICLE
It's high-profile only because of all the backers who have lost faith in the project after all the shady shenanigans that went on with the production companies and the ~~hostile~~ takeover of Kinema Citrus over it while kicking Creative Intelligence Arts to the curb.

I still remember that huge-ass post on this sub by someone allegedly close to Creative Intelligence Arts bitching out Jiro Ishii and fingering him as the source of all the problems with Under the Dog.
>> ARTICLE
It's a significant show because it was crowdfunded. A show with basically no prior knowledge or fanbase was crowdfunded by people in the West. [The director ](http://myanimelist.net/people/6518/Ando_Masahiro) is also pretty significant and has worked on a bunch of other high profile stuff.

Sword Art Online Season 3 should be on here too, release date unconfirmed but likely 2016.
>> ARTICLE
That isn't necessarily true.  By this time of year before Season 2 they already had Extra Edition announced and ready and it aired at the end of December if I remember correctly.  SAO: Ex then had the S2 announcement on it which followed in July of the following year.  First Season was announced in October the year before the Summer airing date.

So if they follow the same trend and announce SAO S3 at the end of the upcoming movie, you might end up waiting another 6 months afterward at least to get Season 3.  So unless the movie comes out real soon, there is a very high probability that the show gets pushed to either the end of 2016 (Fall season) or ends up in the 2017 Winter Season.

I would guess Winter 2017 is when SAO Season 3 is going to land.

It's good.

* MC is not the typical *"will and friendship always wins over logic"* shounen MC, but a more logical one that doesn't underestimate his opponents. But, at the same time, he is not a flawless character.

* The author goes against tropes, makes characters interesting and unlike other shounen manga, he is not afraid to make the story progress.

* Things you would think would happen in the distant future (40+ chapters), end happening way sooner.

* Morally ambiguous characters and an interesting world add more flavor to the story.

Well they did say they apparently bid on everything so who knows. I kind of expect Tanada-Kun, Flying Witch, Kuromuko and Big Order to be a chunk of the shows they get... along with some more shorts. 

Maybe even Netflix will throw a curveball and announce it as a netflix original, they also have other Magi shows so it isn't completely out of left field.

#What I'm REALLY excited for:

**Boku no Hero Academia** - Love the manga, episode was awesome (albeit a bit slow), and the animation/art both looked great. Can't wait to see more of one of my favorite shounen manga :)

**Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Not Crash** - What a beautiful duwang. I've been waiting for this since I finished the manga after the part 3 anime ended. The manga was amazing. Part 4 is one of my 3 10/10 ratings in this series, the other two parts being part 6 and part 7. I'm also super excited to see how David Production did on the OP/EDs this time around. Damn I'm so excited, doesn't hurt that episode 1 was great too. WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY ABOUT MY HAIR?

**Kiznaiver** - Studio Trigger ORIGINAL. Literally what else do you need to know? It's a shame it's not by Imaishi, but I feel like it can be something really special anyways. After all, the animation was great in Kill la Kill, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and also Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace). So if nothing else, I feel like we're in for some great eye candy.

#What I'm cautiously optimistic for/know nothing about but looks good anyways:

**Bungou Stray Dogs** - Studio Bones is killing it this year, I feel like this could be great. That being said, I've never heard of the manga.

**Haifuri** - Premise sounds similar to Nagi no Asukara, which reminds me... I still need to finish Nagi no Asukara. Speaking of P.A. Works....

**Kuromukuro** - P.A. Works original shows seem to be hit or miss, but they're always eye candy. Might watch it just based on that. Also, mechs.

**Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotte?** -  Girls + internet + anime sounds like a big perverted mess of fun. I'll check it out if my fingers don't fall off before typing the name (...as I'm commenting on a post of mine with over 35,000 characters)

**Sakamoto desu ga?** - Another one I've seen a lot about but know little about as a whole. I've heard this is really funny (at least as a manga) so I'm sure I'll like it if I ever get around to it.

#What I'll keep my eye out for:

**Studio DEEN shows** - It's the year of DEEN, after all.

**Big Order** - Same manga artist/writer (?) as Mirai Nikki, so I'll pick it up if I hear anything good. Never seen Mirai Nikki but I heard it's a big mess of murdery fun, so I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up liking either of these.

**Sousei no Onmyouji** - Heard about the manga, but never looked into it. If I hear good about it, I'm sure I'll look into it eventually.

What are you guys watching this season? Anything else I should check out? :)



>> ARTICLE
**Of what I have seen the first episode of**

* **Mayoiga** - Was intriguing and I am quite interested to see where it's going with it's premise. (also don't know why but I really love Lions character design)

* **Ace Attorney** It was Meh, I like courtroom antics but this seemed to be very stiff, obviously the video game elements play a big part in that.

* **Boku no Hero Academia** I tried to get into the manga some time last year but really struggled, the show on the other hand is being animated by bones, and they can draw me into anything with their character animation. I found the anime experience really fun and I look forward to more.

* **Endride** Welp, how the hell is this the sort of content getting 2 cours, the first episode was stupendously bad, and I wasn't even expecting anything from it.

* **RE:Zero** Haven't had chance to finish what has been released but part A was incredibly fun, and i know it get's darker but first impression is very solid. 

**Upcoming premieres I'm excited for (in hype order)**

* **Flying Witch** Looks chill and fun, hype probably isn't the right word but I wants this show.

* **Bungou Stray Dogs** Bones will be Bones and I shall partake.

* **Joker Game** Good premise, studio, promotional art and tags that get my attention, I am looking forward to this one.

**Upcoming premieres I will be watching without Hype**

* **Kizanaiver** The artstyle definitely catches my attention but I don't have enough experience with Trigger to be invested before it airs.

* **Kabaneri of the Iron fortress** Basically just saying fuck it I may aswell give it a go, not expecting much even though I am a huge fan of Attack on Titan.

* **Big Order** No expectations or much knowledge of what to expect, gonna use it as a completely blind run in.

* **Tanaka-Kun** Slice of life, promotional looks appealing, basically going in with that and a skim read of the premise.

You only have ~150 episodes worth of content to catch up on, you can do that in about two days.
>> ARTICLE
Meh. I've heard good things so I'm sure I'll watch it at some point. I have a lot I want to do though so I don't know when I'll get to it.
>> ARTICLE
The two big ones for me are **Concrete Revolutio 2** and **Joker Game**. Obviously the former is probably only watchable if you've seen the first season, but the latter looks very promising.

**Concrete Revolutio** was one of the top shows of last year, with some interesting themes and a huge amount of complex world-building. It setup a lot of mysteries and it will be very interesting to see how the second half wraps everything up.

**Joker Game** is apparently an adaption of a proper novel rather than a manga or LN series. It's a period spy thriller with some very serious and detailed-looking animation. Hopefully will be a treat for more mature viewers.

*Other stuff I'm checking out:*

**Re: Zero** - heard a couple of hints it may be interesting, so I'll give at least the first episode a look.

**Gundam Unicorn** - Enjoyed the amazing animation quality of the OVAs but stopped following them halfway through due to the slow release schedule. I'll probably try to use this release as a reminder to finish the series.

A couple of comedies that may end up being funny - **Sakamoto** and **Netoge no Yome**. I expect **Sakamoto** to be funny enough to stick with but I'm less sure about the other.

A scattering of action shows that I'll try out and may end up dropping - **Ushio to Tora 2**, **Boku no Hero Academia**, **Sinbad no Bouken**, **Gakusen Toshi Asterisk 2** and **Sousei no Onmyouji**.

*Shows I'm wary about following:*

 **Mayoiga** and **Kiznaiver**. These strike me as the sort of projects that could easily end up as slightly pretentious failures that don't live up to their ambitions (see also: Charlotte). I'll probably keep an eye on discussion for them but won't jump in unless I'm convinced they're worthwhile.


>> ARTICLE
How can anyone drop Sinbad? Magi was epic.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't really looked into many other than the ones I mentioned. I'll definitely check out Joker game. But I heard Concrete Revolutio s1 wasn't that great. Did I hear wrong?
>> ARTICLE
Some people really dislike it it seems, but I thought ConRev was fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, you heard wrong. I've expanded my post a bit, but it was an interesting show with plenty to appreciate. A lot of people dropped it because it uses some non-linear storytelling that can be quite hard to follow, but I'd say it's definitely worth the effort.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, cool! It was one of those shows I was looking forward to before it came out, and then I heard bad reviews so it pushed me a way a bit. I'll have to check it out... adding to my never-ending backlog. 

@ the rest of your comment you edited in:

Re:Zero seems to be getting a lot of praise around here. I'll definitely be checking in.

Gundam unicorn - heard the first part was great, but I've only seen part of Iron Blooded Orphans... then no other gundam series. Not sure if that's an ok place to start. 

I already commented on Sakamoto, but I've never heard of Netoge no Yome outside of when I was making the list. idk.

Boku no Hero Academia is awesome. I highly suggest it if you like shounen manga/anime. The first episode was a bit slow, but I imagine they're gonna pick it up soon... plus the animation was gorgeous. Bones really did a good job with it.

Didn't watch Ushio to Tora, Asterisk, or Magi prequels so they're all out to me. 

I'm hoping Kiznaiver is something special, but after Ninja Slayer, I'm not getting my hopes too far up. I do believe it can be great though... Trigger is life.
>> ARTICLE
> I've never heard of Netoge no Yome outside of when I was making the list. idk.

It sounds interesting at first. The MC is part of an MMO club in the school, but he's the only boy...

The only thing that i find interesting about it, is that the MC once confessed to a G.I.L.R. online (Guy In Real Life.) Ever since then he's been *very* hesitant on chatting with any girls online.

But the show quickly drops that premise and makes a mad B Line towards the typical Light Novel, Ecchi, Harem that i love to hate.

There's the Tsundere childhood friend, the Pay 2 Win president (big boobed) and there's the overly obsessive "wife" that love's the MC for NO REASON.  
Well, there is a reason and that reason is because she's fucking crazy. Not the "cute, haha" crazy or the "Yandere" crazy, but fucking mentally ill/retarded.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam Unicorn is worth it if you want to see utterly mind-blowing combat animation. There's almost nothing that comes close to the quality of the mech battle scenes in it.

I've seen the first episode of Hero Academia and it was enough to keep me interested. Nothing particularly unique but I'm at least curious about how the protagonist will end up suceeding, and what his idol's secret is. It also looks like there's a really quirky supporting cast waiting to be introduced.

I technically haven't finished the 2nd Magi season (I tend to enjoy the earlier adventure segments of their seasons but get a bit bored near the end when they go full shounen with transformations and power-ups.) However this one is actually a prequel, so it should be watchable even without seeing the other stuff.

> I've seen the first episode of Hero Academia and it was enough to keep me interested. Nothing particularly unique

That's its charm imo. The author takes so many risks by... not taking risks. He does everything you expect him to. But the execution is the strong point. 

I do like eye candy. I've been thinking of getting into gundam or more mech anime in general anyways.


>> ARTICLE
I heard the first episode of Unicorn is inferior to the OVAs, just a heads-up.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I've seen the first episode of it. The mess they made with the starting scene was a bad decision, but hopefully it's a one-off example, and at least it didn't seem to involve cutting anything out.
>> ARTICLE
You should definitely check out [Re:Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu) it's a 2-cour series and the first episode that came out yesterday was an hour. It's by Whitefox who also did Steins;Gate. I highly recommend you watch it. It's on Crunchyroll and the episode was split into 1A and 1B
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or does the heroine sound like Megumin from Konosuba? Come to think of it, the stories are kinda similar as well. Both of the characters are shut-ins, are whisked away into a fantasy world, and the animes are self-aware RPGs. XD 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, same VA.
>> ARTICLE
God damn it, I just saw part b; definitely made by the people who did Steins Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the suggestion! I'll almost definitely check it out just because it's on Crunchyroll lol. 
>> ARTICLE
re: zero seems great. Mayhem, violence, similar premise as no game no life. Less fanservice but damn the show rocks.
>> ARTICLE
No Game No Life - ecchi + violence.... awesome. Definitely sounds interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the effort! 

Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu's first episode was amazing and waiting for the next sunday will be painful, I also enjoyed a lot the JoJo and Mayoiga (and Ace Attorney, but I'm a hardcore fan of the series so that's easy).

Now waiting mainly for Swagamoto and Big Order, but this season is looking a lot better than expected.
>> ARTICLE
I was feeling withdrawals after that first episode. I hate not being able to read ahead when there is a glut of source material.
>> ARTICLE
> Thank you for the effort!

No problem!

Glad to see you enjoyed ReZero, Jojo, Ace Attorney and Mayoiga!

I highly suggest Boku no Hero Academia if you like power shounen! :)
>> ARTICLE
Since you are posting it this late, I might as well piggyback on this thread then. [my blog post for the PV collection](https://tentacleactions.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/2016-anime-spring-season-pv-collection/)

I tried getting it out earlier, but life got in the way unfortunately :/

But a lot of the shows haven't started airing yet, and I think (and hope) these threads are useful for people :p

Thanks for the link! :)
>> ARTICLE
How do you assemble these?  A spreadsheet with reddit formatting markers concatenated in?  I just finished updating my tracking spreadsheet for the latest season, which involved figuring out which shows I'd be watching and setting up my own automatic MAL and viewing links, so I'm sort of just sitting here appreciating the style rather than the substance...
>> ARTICLE
Do it all by hand. I have pre-made linksets that look like this:

Then I add any links available, and...

They can get pretty ridiculous...

**Monogatari Series** (Anime series) - *Comedy, Ecchi, Mystery, Romance, Vampire, Supernatural* - /r/Araragi - MAL has a different order than this, but this is the best way to do it. I will number them in that order afterwards with ***bold italics***. It is suggested to go the release order the first time, but the second time go ahead and try whatever you want. One more thing, MAL has the shorter parts as TV series as well, so I just put them as seasons. *Nekomonogatari: Kuro* and *Tsukimonogatari* are both 4 episodes while *Hanamonogatari* is 5. As you can see from the list, 'Monogatari Second Season' is the fourth season. Don't let the name fool you. The reasoning behind the name 'Second Season' is that the light novel series is made up of three parts, 'First Season,' 'Second Season,' and 'Final Season.' Let me know if you want more information, I have a list of links for the LN and a description of what anime correspond with what LN.

I have a microsoft word chart with a bunch of series on it. So I just copy pasted those two because they were 10s on your MAL :p

Edit: I obviously modified it a bit for this thread, lots of stuff missing and I added the studio stuff 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow.  That's pretty hardcore.  How long does this take you per season?  And how do you figure out which streaming sites have it?  Just running a search on each one?

Also, since I'm incredibly presumptuous and prejudiced against Microsoft Word (spreadsheets4lyfe), [I whipped up a spreadsheet demo for you](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qHF0Kjp-93J2gSJZEbIprNJ97kLLsKYBxhokQgg_brk/edit?usp=sharing).  Save yourself a copy and play around with it.  I put some instructions for use on the second tab, but I'm not sure how much spreadsheet experience you have, so let me know if they don't make sense or if it just straight-up doesn't work.  I'm hoping it'll be able to save you some time and/or grief, in the spirit of how much work it must be for you to assemble this thing for us.  If it's not helpful for you, well, part of why I was doing it was to distract myself from continued browsing on Amazon for things to buy.  That's an expensive thing to be doing, so doing this worked out for me regardless.

Sample output after filling in data only:

>> ARTICLE
Hmmm I'm on mobile right now but that would certainly speed the process up. I've actually never used a spreadsheet before, these threads take me about 7-8 hours.. Maybe more. Depends on how into it I get and how much I want to experiment (this one I did like 3 new things so it took longer.. Anime studios + links, then the adaptation thing at the bottom.)

But yeah I'll check it out when i get home. Thanks a bunch! 
>> ARTICLE
This season is absolutely incredible so far and not even half of the shows I planned to try out have aired yet.

Mayoiga, Boku no Hero Academia and Re:Zero have all hit the mark with their opening episodes for me. Terra Formars s2 seems like it'll continue on just as well as the first season and Ace Attorney, poor visuals aside, looks like it'll be a fine adaption so far. Plus what I assume will be the climax of Assassination Classroom alongside that.

Still waiting on Flying Witch, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, Netoge, Bungou Stray Dogs, Big Order and Kiznaiver. If even a few of those match up with what we've seen so far, this'll definitely be one of my favorite seasons in recent memory.
>> ARTICLE
Terra Formars S2 seems like it's completely fallen apart after just the first episode. The animation seems different and lower quality, the tone of the show has completely changed with poorly placed cheap comedic bits, there was zero blood in the first episode, and it spent far too long on awkwardly placed flashbacks. It went from 4/5 first season, to 2/5 for me after this episode.
>> ARTICLE
It's going to be good, but like last season though there's a quantity of shows there's nothing hitting that 9-10 sweet spot yet and I think it already used its two best chances (Boku no Hero and Re:Zero) and turned up 8s.

Plenty of time left though.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I think all the three I mentioned have the potential to be 9s so long as they don't deteriorate in quality, but in general it doesn't bother me.

Masterpieces deserving of a 10/10 rating are great but these are few and far between (I've only rated six shows as such) so all I would ask out of any season is a healthy selection of shows all week-round that make me want to watch them the moment they're out, instead of putting them off and getting to the end of the season with six episodes still to watch. If they can do this the overall quality isn't too relevant.
>> ARTICLE
> Masterpieces deserving of a 10/10 rating are great but these are few and far between (I've only rated six shows as such)

Yeah, I've only got 5 myself.

I don't know, I consider that a caretaker season, I don't mind that so much, but I prefer it when a classic shines out too. 

>> ARTICLE
TY for this.

No problem! What are you looking forward to this season?
>> ARTICLE
I don't really know yet, I'm still finishing up last seasons stuff before diving into this one, this is a nice reference though!
>> ARTICLE
Ah I feel you. When you get around to it I suggest watching Boku no Hero Academia and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
>> ARTICLE
Heh for sure hero academy, I read it :). For Jojo, Im trying to catch up but I kind of just started the series in general
>> ARTICLE
If you're going the anime route for Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, you should definitely try to hold out until at least episode 10. Each 'part' has a different MC, and the second MC is one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Will I miss anything if I watch this season's Jojo without watching any previous series?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's hard to explain. Each part is self contained but it also adds to the story of each previous part. Plus if you started with part 4, you'd miss out on part 2. I highly suggest starting at the beginning. It's only like 75 episodes and it's totally worth it anyways

What should I watch from the shows that are airing today? (Monday)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what you're into but I've heard **Bakuon!!** is pretty good, K-on with Motorcycles instead of music.

**Hundred** and **Seisen Cerberus** both seem to be your standard magic battle harem (in that group of High School DxD-esque anime), if you're into those. 

Other than that, I think you would know what else you'd be interested in there. Like, Sailor Moon, Beyblade and Kaitou Joker are all continuations of previous entries. And the **12-Sai. Chiccha na Mune no Tokimeki** anime is a shoujo anime about a 12 year old girl that discovers love for the first time.

Far too much -_- Sorry for the wall of text, you triggered me.

Every season I have to make a continuous effort to be more picky about what I watch. And every season I fail this test of self restraint. Maybe this time I can get it under 6 shows, not including shorts or [AssClass S2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30654/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu_TV_2nd_Season). [I really regret watching [Dimension W](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31163/Dimension_W) and [Musaigen](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31442/Musaigen_no_Phantom_World) last season].

What I've watched so far.

[Ace Attorney 01](/s "Fuck I hated this. I understand why it is why it is from adaptation, but god damn it makes a poor anime with poor animation. It made me angry")

[Everything Flows 01](/s "Turns out it was only accidentally in my spring 2016 folder and it's finished airing. I loved episode one so much, and can't wait for more. I might have spoiled myself a little by seeing the genre list on MAL and I'm not signed up for a feels trip.")

[Boku no Hero Academia | 01](/s "It was ok. I'm sticking around due to manga reputation [which I've not read]. Same for Sakamoto.")

[Kiznaiver | 00](/s "I learned it's by the creators of Kill la Kill, and it looks very pretty so I'm quite hyped.")

[Kuma Miko | 01](/s "Well this was surprising, I loved this a lot more than I was expecting too. This humour is right up my alley.")

[Pan de Peace | 01](/s "What kind of a monster eats a raw fucking croissant!?")

[Mayoiga | 01](/s "What a fucking cock tease episode. It spent all that time raising tension, then doesn't give us a pay off or relieve us. Maybe it'll be good but I want put in the time investment to find out, I'll rely on others for that.")

[Re:Zero | 01A](/s "Very conflicted about this one. I like the humour, but that is some god damn prolific jank cg. I'll give it 3 episodes")

So, dropped Ace Attourney and Mayoiga. Love Kuma Miko, Everything Flows and Pan de Peace. Undecided on Boku no Hero Academia, Kiznaiver and Re:Zero [will give em 3 episodes].

---

God damnit I had to type this out twice because I some how refreshed the page when I finished it the first time. So annoying, and time consuming.

edit: I have now seen [Re:Zero 01B](/s "It was fucking sick. It's like Akame ga Kill and Konosuba's baby. So good, I'm willing to give Mayoiga 3 episodes to prove itself.").

I'm pretty sure this and where else you read are in error and it'll be April 10th, not 3rd.

Funimation are notoriously slow about getting their shit together at the start of seasons.

Ahh I see, I wasn't aware of that. I've been hearing a lot of criticism of them though, so perhaps I should have expected it. Thanks for the explanation.

Going to post a first impressions thread in a week or so when I've watched the first episode of the **16 shows** I'm at least watching the first episode of this season.

* Gyakuten Saiban: Sono "Shinjitsu", Igi Ari! - 7/10
* Kuma Miko - 7/10
* Pan de Peace -  6/10

Nothing with an average or below first episode yet.

I don't really see the point to a list like this. [anichart.net](http://anichart.net/airing) has a really good list already set up.

Even [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/season) has a page.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, I feel you but I've done this list about 6 times now, and while it's a lot of work, it gives me a good solid excuse to talk about the new season, see what people are interested in watching, etc. I think you might be the first person to say it's not necessary, which I actually agree with :p
>> ARTICLE
I remember one of my friends, who was into the series years even before the 2012 anime came out, was saying that if you'd told him 5 years ago, "Hey one day they'll animate JoJo Part 4 [probably] in its entirety], he'd have thought it was just a cruel joke. JoJo part 4 was the kind of thing that appeared on troll-season charts back in the day. 

The fact it's actually happening is undeniably rad. 
>> ARTICLE
Just like Mushishi or FMP. Now if only a good adaption from Hoshi no Samidare would come along as well...
>> ARTICLE
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is my favorite manga series ever. I'm equally stoked for part 4 as I would be for part 6, 7 and 8 actually. All of it is awesome but those 3 parts (4,6,7) and 2 are so close to perfection. Love them to death
>> ARTICLE
Yeah for me I'm waiting for a potential Part 5. I really do feel that this Part 4 animation might open the flood gates to the rest.
1-2-3 was realistic and understandable. Animating the most popular arc in Japan, the arc that started it all and the arc that connects them. But Part 4 makes it seem like David might be in this for the long-haul. It's very exciting.
>> ARTICLE
I read through 5 before the translation was re-completed, so I might reread that and enjoy it more the second time around, but I didn't like it as much as the other parts. Imo, the ranking of the parts is:

6=4=2>7>3>5>1. Not including 8 since it isn't completed. 
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait to see anime only watchers  reacting to Attack on Titan S2.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's gonna be fun. Didn't even think of that aspect of anticipating anime.
>> ARTICLE
The threads are going to be hilarious to watch.  Gonna be interesting since so many people have caught up as well to see how the hype builds.
>> ARTICLE
Is it really that bad? 
>> ARTICLE
No--actually for all the twists that are coming.  Some people will be expecting them and other people will be like WTF.
>> ARTICLE
Well that was a tough choice. I had to pick between *Hibike! Euphonium S2*, *Shokugeki no Soma S2*, and *Shingeki no Kyojin S2*. All of which I rated as 10s for their first seasons. I ended up going withe Hibike since it has my favorite characters and is narrowly my favorite over Shokugeki and Shingeki.
>> ARTICLE
I really need to watch Hibike.
>> ARTICLE
It's good in its own way but don't get too hyped -- there are things it does and things it doesn't do.
>> ARTICLE
>and things it doesn't do

Like actual yuri.
>> ARTICLE
This year is incredible. This is the most hyped I've been all decade.

Heaven's Feel, Kizumonogatari, ReLIFE, Koe no Kotachi, Attack on Titan 2, Diamond is unbreakable, Hibike 2, Evangelion 3.0+1.0, Concrete Revolutio, Mob Psycho, My Hero Academia, a serious Trigger show and Kanojo to Kanojo no neko.
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit, the 3 movies are coming out this year? Damn, I have to finish watching the 2nd and 3rd seasons.

Oh, also [Koutetsujou no Kabaneri](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28623/Koutetsujou_no_Kabaneri), by Wit Studio.  Seems a bit like a cross between *Snowpiercer* and *The Walking Dead,* with a steampunk-influenced aesthetic.

Not as much suffering as I'm going through waiting for this.

 I'm going crazy just waiting for a release day announcement. Hell, when some guy uploaded the game play for the VN on YouTube I spent 2-3 hours watching it even though I didn't understand 95% of what was going on.

I'm waiting for Evangelion: 3.0+1.0, I can't wait for the conclusion if there is one! (Please Anno) Iv'e spent countless hours/days rattling my brain on what could happen in 3.0+1.0 Personally I think  [Spoiler](/s "Rei's and Kaworu (Not sure about Kaworu) soul/s are trapped in the tape recorder because Shinji had it with him when Rei and Kaworu both died in the EVA's and LCL.   Or this one is a long shot, But instead of music on 
Shinji's tape recorder could be recordings of himself as a diary which continues on from NGE") But who knows? any thing could happen. 
>> ARTICLE
At this point honestly, after watching 3.0, I'm not 100% sure Anno isn't trying to find a way to surpass his original ending and can't figure out how to do it, which is why it's taking so long.

I AM curious though with 3.33 releasing if the alterations in the English dub from the original that had to be redone will give clues as to what might happen.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't gotten around to watching the ReBuilds yet, but I've heard they deviate from NGE after the first movie, so I'm hoping that 3.0+1.0 will be significantly different from the original but just as good in terms of mind-bending conclusion.
>> ARTICLE
Had to vote on Steins;Gate 0. Yeah, I'm really, REALLY looking forward to Boku no Hero Academia, but we're getting a midquel to one of my favorite anime of all time, how can I not be SUPER FUCKING HYPE. On top of that, we have Kiznaiver, Berserk, and Mob Psycho 100, along with other sequels to awesome shows I'm not really caught up on yet. 2016 is gonna be a hell of a ride.

Evangelion 4.0 is really the only thing has me on the edge of my seat. What insane place is it going to go? How would you even finish that series? Cannot wait.

Koe no Katachi is the only I'm really looking forward to. Couple other are nice but not I-definitly-need-this-animated-nice.

Mainly because I can't limit it otherwise. It's either 'pick one' or 'let voters pick multiple options' and you guys could vote on literally everything if you wanted to. Someone did that last year <_<

If I could limit it to like... 5ish, I would do it. But as it stands now, you can only pick one. Sorry!

Are they gonna reach the slow parts? Manga readers already started complaining, I can't imagine what the anime watchers (particularly the casual ones) are going to say...

^^^^I ^^^^loved ^^^^them ^^^^though
>> ARTICLE
The thing I'm looking forward to the most right now is definitely  Saekano S2
>> ARTICLE
Season 1 was surprisingly awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
Only 3 of these are original anime. One of those is even arguably not original I think (Evangelion since I think it's a retelling? never saw NGE). And out of those, only one of those isn't a sequel.

Trigger plz save anime again.

Looking forward to a lot of these too. Particularly Mob Psycho 100, Boku no Hero Academia, ReLIFE, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Shokugeki no Souma, Berserk... the list just goes on...

 I wanted to put trailers and air dates in there too, but 5 columns is just... too much.

The Evangelion Rebuilds started as a straight retelling, but by this point they have completely diverged from the story of the show.

Oh god, Heaven's Feel or Kizu? This isn't fair. I feel so dirty for voting against Monogatari.
>> ARTICLE
Wow wow.  So I generally have zero hype or expectations going into new shows or new seasons.  I clicked this thread without thinking and just said "well probably won't agree with much ...".

However, looking down the title list, it's really damn packed:

1.  Berserk.  Classic.  People have been demanding a continuation for decades.

2.  FSN HF.  The hype on this is huge, although if it's only 1 movie in length, that might be fairly "meh".

3.  Saekano.  One of the most surprising and entertaining things I've seen.  I like to think of it as a Monogatari that doesn't get lost in its own meandering.

4.  Shokugeki no Souma.  One of the most entertaining shows I've seen that surprised me and came out of nowhere.  I would love to see the sequel.

5.  Steins;Gate 0.  Obviously -- there are ridiculous expectations around this.


There are several other almost-top contenders on the list.  It's tough to pick one out of these though ...

Probably just HF for magnitude of potential awesome.  Berserk is high but it's also *that* old.  Saekano is great but it's a smidge less great several seasons after the fact.  Steins;Gate has a lot of room to ~~fail~~ no meet expectations.  Shokugeki is simply more of the same.

HF is a bit unique because it presents potential on multiple levels:

1.  New story branch.
2.  Different characters / character focus.
3.  /r/anime reactions to FSN as a whole changing due to HF.
4.  Ufotable fight scenes.

It can still fall short like all the others, but the meta potential of FSN HF is pretty big IMO.  I don't just want to see it, I want to see what it does to the community here and on /r/fatestaynight, etc.

Macross just missing out of the top 5 and with only 12 voters. Hoping to start this one soon to see what all the hype is about!

Now I wish I had voted, although it's still pretty good for a show you can't even watch legally.
>> ARTICLE
You will not regret it... 

One could literally just watch Macross for the songs.
>> ARTICLE
Not really much of a song person though...

I've seen both LL and Idolm@ster and maybe remember like 2-3 songs...
>> ARTICLE
Hmm... Well, historically, Macross has always had great songs and the show itself isn't bad at all. It's a bit on the wacky side but enjoyable nevertheless.

Which raises the question: Have you listened to any Macross songs?
>> ARTICLE
> Have you listened to any Macross songs?

Nope, never heard any. I'll wait to see/hear them in the series before going out looking for them :p

>> ARTICLE
Well, this is only one of many. The ones before it had some amazing songs as well.

But anyway, I won't try to persuade you one way or another. Macross is an experience. You either like it or you don't.

JoJo on top and Endride at the bottom. Seems about right to me.

I was actually relieved when it got delayed this past weekend. And then filled with dread when it went up on Funimation.

I wanted to watch Divine Gate, but I never got around to starting it. From what my friends have told me, it seems I made the right call.

Right call is an understatement.

The opening is one of my favorites of all time, but nothing else can be salvaged from that wreckage.

Nah, it's alright. I know it was Pierrot, and that's enough for me.

You left Asterisk Wars off your survey, by the way.

The shows with low voters also seem to be producing some odd results (with the obvious example being Magi).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I'll make sure it's on the survey next week.

Yeah, sample size on Magi is also small but I decided to leave it on there. People can ignore them if they feel like it.

I'm also calculated a ranking using margins instead of winning votes for defeat strength. There's some [differences](http://imgur.com/09LhCoN). I'm not exactly sure which one to use for future rankings lists.

Concrete Revolutio S2 with the first 0 I think I've ever gotten. Surprised almost no one voted for Bahamut. Tbh, most of these look pretty great (at least the ones I know about). JJBA looks amazing, S;G looks great (and I heard the VN is awesome as well). Pretty hype for Boku no Hero and ReLIFE... and Mob Psycho... And Saekano S2... and Kiznaiver... and Ace Attorney... and Berserk... and oh man I could list them all again but they're already there lol.
>> ARTICLE
I thought a lot more people would be hyped for AoT S2 after the way S1 ended. 
>> ARTICLE
AoT had a lot of pacing issues that hurt it (they actually stuck *too close* to the manga). It did get me interested enough that I began to follow the manga, but that in turn has made me lose interest in a second season of the anime. The direction the manga has gone manages to keep my interest, but doesn't really get me excited.

If those titles are the ones you used on the poll, then probably the reason no-one voted for Bahamut is that you listed the wrong series.

As for Concrete Revolutio, I'm more excited for it than the majority of shows on that list, but honestly nothing else compares to the realisation that there will finally be an adaption of Berserk that goes beyond the Golden Age arc.

#Best Animation

I'm abstaining as I have only seen OPM.

#Best Wingman/Wingwoman

This one is tough, I haven't seen Ore Monogatari (yet) but I think out of the two remaining I have to go with Komachi. 

#Most Anticipated

Now, THIS is tough. I'm so hype for Shokugeki, but it absolutely must go to Jojo, as Part 4 is my favorite part of JJBA as a whole and I can't wait to see it animated!!! There were a TON of awesome ones left out too, kinda disappointed not a lot of people are into Boku no Hero Academia or Ace Attorney.

That being said, I think Boku no Hero should get some form of recognition for being the top rated thing that isn't a sequel to something else on the list. I'll give it a special mention or something on the finals winner announcements! :3
























>> ARTICLE
Damn, I wanted Migi in the finals for the Wingman part :(

Voted for Shokugeki no Soma Season 2, maybe SG0 hypes me more, but I'm a manga reader of Shokugeki (I loved the anime so much!) and I'm so happy to see that the story will keep getting adapted
>> ARTICLE
UBW, but I really wouldn't be disappointed with OPM or Hibike taking it. They all had superb animation.

Suna by a goddamn mile. Ruri was pretty solid herself by pushing Kosaki, but failed to actually clear up misunderstandings like the ultimate wingman Suna.

Heaven's Feel. This one is tough because I'm also really looking forward to JoJo, everything Gatari, and seeing some LoGH as it airs, but I'm more invested in the Fate universe so that gets my vote.


>> ARTICLE
RIP LotGH

My votes: F/SN UBW, Abstain, LotGH (would've voted for Jojo but I'm glad this got the wild-card.)
>> ARTICLE
Definitely looking forward to Shokugeki. I steamrolled through the manga the same day I watched the finale. That's just the kind of show Food wars is.

Have only seen OPM and UBW from the animation category, and between the two, I'm going with UBW. Personal preference.
>> ARTICLE
Gakuto...where is Gakuto on the wingman list /r/anime? He gave up his high school life, we commemorated a unit of bro in honor of his sacrifices. Yet how does one simply throw that away after a season?
>> ARTICLE
OPM

Abstain

Souma S2. This one was difficult, there are so many titles I'm looking forward to -- but Souma is just too fun I'm really looking forward to the continuation :)
>> ARTICLE
Have you read the manga? S2 is bound to be even better than S1 for Souma.... I can't wait for it!
>> ARTICLE
Nah I haven't. That's good to hear :)
>> ARTICLE
HIGHLY suggest reading it. The current arc we're in is intense, and up til this point there's a huge amount of character development. I really like the manga
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good and I might read it after S2 airs, I much prefer anime as an medium over manga, so because S2 is coming out I won't read the manga until after that maybe :)
>> ARTICLE
fair enough. but it might be a long wait
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Etotama made it in via wild card. The CGI was absolutely amazing in that show.
>> ARTICLE
Hibike! It was great

Sunakawa. Dude is an absolute bro.

Heavens feel. It's gonna be lit.
>> ARTICLE
Best Animation as in best looking, or best show?

If its the former and not the latter, man the OPM circle jerk is real, I don't see how anyone could say visually OPM beats out Hibike! or UBW, at all. I haven't watched Etotama, so I won't comment on its visual prowess or lack thereof.
>> ARTICLE
UBW is just average animation smothered in expensive-looking special effects. Hibike's animation is legitimately really good, but you're either hate-jerking or blind if you think OPM doesn't deserve to be here.
>> ARTICLE
Best looking. Best show is tomorrow. But that also just goes into animation, not art. So even if art is shitty, it can win for how well the shitty art moves... If that makes sense
