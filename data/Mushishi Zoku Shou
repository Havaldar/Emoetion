ITTTTS BACK!!!!

I really enjoyed finally getting some more backstory on Ginko this episode. Seeing him not as the rational mushishi we know and love but rather as the young, uncertain, and anxious boy really gave him some long needed character development. 

Cant wait for next weeks episode "The Fragrant Darkness"

>> ARTICLE
It's nice to witness another turning point of Ginko's past, since we haven't seen any of it since episode 12 of the 1st season. You can really see that even though this event had a rather melancholy conclusion, young Ginko took a lot from it. He definitely doesn't have that same wonder and fascination in the mushi that we are so accustomed to, but you can see that his position begins to change by the ending from the initial resent he felt for them.

Despite doing something terrible to the natural order, the mushi still beckon him back, essentially validating his existence and telling him that he *does* have a place in the world. This is something that young Ginko has probably never experience from people before (we hear in the beginning how wherever he goes, he is always followed by rumors of a strange boy that brings disaster with him). Although he's hesitant, you can see how the mushi have given him a sense of belonging and purpose, and rather than seeing them as a burden, he is beginning to become curious.

The final scene where he lightly touches the mushi residing in his eye and falls asleep was a perfect way to sum up all that took place.
>> ARTICLE
and i felt that ginko had a distrust in people at the start because he said that the previous mushishi he had been with took advantage of him to make money then tossed him away when things got hairy.. it was suguro who had no other intention for him other than wishing him well.. the things suguro said to ginko was pretty touching imo.. shed a manly  old tear.. probably cuz i missed the show too much though.. only anime i watch


>> ARTICLE
It was a great way to return to the show. I felt like the themes were very representative of the entire series: there are mistakes that can never be undone, but no existence is a mistake in and of itself. 
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is back, and all is right with the world.

Was it just me or was young Ginko voiced by Sawashiro Miyuki?

Edit: [Yup] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi) she's played young ginko before, never realized.

When Ginko was running through the forest I knew the voice was familiar. When it hit me all I could hear was a flustered Inaba from Kokoro Connect.

I had just watched SAO an hour before so I heard Sinon, but yeah, same thing.

I watched SAO an hour later. What a disappointment by comparison.

I love this anime so much. I just feel utter bliss during every episode.

This one was a little dark to be feeling bliss. Might want to talk to someone about that.

The budget for this show must be a mushi. There's no way something so beautiful and improbable could exist otherwise.

I guess everyone has that one episode of Mushishi that they just can't get out of there heads. By the end of this one I was crying and I didn't realize or know how long I had been. I guess it just struck me in a very personal way.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same. The incredibly graceful way they told the story, building off what little back story we have about Ginko and expanding it... and that ending hit me the same exact way. I bawled my eyes out.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic episode.
>> ARTICLE
i fucking missed the opening its so good

and we get to see ginko's past damn this episode was a strong one for the second half of the season 2 

was hyped since the end of the first half
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see Ginko's past :)
>> ARTICLE
That was a really quiet and beautiful episode. It hasn't been that long, but i've missed this show so much. 

It relaxes me like nothing else.

Also, [Ginko looks so cool in this frame](http://i.imgur.com/fU5J4C7.png).

YES ! God it feels like years since I last watched Zoku Shou. One of the few episodic anime that I enjoy on a non-comedic level with a calming OST and overall tone. This is likely already gonna be my AOTS with FSN close behind. 
>> ARTICLE
I love how a couple of the earlier episodes somehow connects to this one. The darkness reminded me a bit of the Path of Thorns special and the Cloudless Rain episode also relates.

Do not fear, you will find it, for there is no place in the world where you do not belong.

Worth the wait, is all i can say :D
>> ARTICLE
It's back! Seems like it's been awhile since the first part of this season aired. Really glad there was character development for Ginko, there has been so little in this series. 

I guess the theme to take away from this episode is that everyone has a purpose in this world. They just need to find it. 
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the fact that we finally got some more background on Ginko. I think it's a nice followup to the special. Ginko ended up accepting mushi for what they are from his his experiences, and Kumado had the opposite, both flipping their opinions (resentment to attachment for Ginko, indifference to resentment for Kumado) of mushi from the effects of one event. In both cases, the actions of other people had caused their resentment. 

Ginko really pulled on my heartstrings this episode. That part where he started crying and every time he said something self-depricating killed me a little bit inside. The ending was cathartic.

[Anyway, here's some screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/5gkpP) I'm extremely happy Mushishi is back. I'm curious about what the final episode will be. I can't really imagine an 'ending point', but the manga already had one.

Can I watch this if I haven't watched the latest special yet and watch the special afterwards?

I think you misinterpreted his question. He means can he watch this if he hasn't seen the special that comes after season 2 yet. Which he definitely can.
>> ARTICLE
this one though requires a little bit a back story though.. like the permadark mushi, the reasons for his white hair and some info about mountain lord in the mushishi universe.. this one is not a straight on hop in episode..

suggest to watch mushishi season 1 "the sleeping mountain", "one eyed fish" and the zoku shou's "banquet of the forest" so you know what mountain lord and the light vein are.

Should be no problem at all.

I have only watched the first season of the 2006 Mushishi and it didn't follow a specific storyline except the ones that explained Ginko's story, can I watch this?

Yes, but you should watch the first half of zoku shou before you start the second half.

Generally you can watch Mushishi in whatever order you like, it's very episodic.

does this really count as S2 if this is just the unaired episode 11/12?

No, this is season 2 of Zoku Shou. The unaired episodes, 11 and 12, were released as a  47 minute long special, and can be found here: http://myanimelist.net/anime/24687/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_Special

Episodes 11 and 12 from the first part of the S2 were aired in August. It was a special episode : http://myanimelist.net/anime/24687/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_Special  
What we got now is the second part of the S2. I hope it's clear for you.
>> ARTICLE
thanks for your reply! yeah, that's what I thought at first but then the OP has

>Also knows as: Episode 11

so i got confused...
>> ARTICLE
This episode may have been one of the most well done episodes of Mushishi ever, even including the first season. The story flows so well, and follows its own pace, not revealing anything until absolutely necessary. This pacing engaged the viewer, not explaining what was going on until it was fairly clear to the us.

The presence of Ginko in this episode was fantastic, he was such an important figure but at the same time only spent one night with the family. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I didn't really like Ginko's appearance here. It would have added so much to the mystery and atmosphere if he hadn't explained exactly what's happening and how to avoid it. The writers lampshaded the fact that you really can't know that this mushi exists and I think it should have stayed that way. Where is the quiet magic of mushi if all of them are known? Kaoru's story would have been fine if he had made the decisions he did on his own, with his feelings of uneasiness or his love for his wife driving him to avoid or enter the tunnel.
>> ARTICLE
I think it could have been great either way, but Ginko's presence was important. If he wasn't there than Kaoru never would have discovered what was causing his feeling of forgetfulness, and we never would have had the story switch to his wife's point of view. 

For the viewer, the mystery of the flashbacks generates intrigue, but once the mystery unravels, the story would have nowhere to go. This could have been successful if the episode was paced differently, but they would have had to make the flashbacks much longer in the beginning, risking losing the interest of the viewer. Ginko's interference in the time loop creates a break in the repetition after the viewer has come to understand the mechanic of this particular mushi. This way when Kaoru finally sees things for the first time, the viewer feels the same way, and when the image of his fatally injured wife appears we feel the same hopelessness as Kaoru: The feeling that this wasn't the new world we wished for.

>> ARTICLE
Really love how each episode of Mushi-shi is a self-contained parable. I enjoyed the colour palette for this episode!
>> ARTICLE
I was crying through the entire last five minutes, made my day.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed a great episode. I'm a sucker for time loops. I really like how he gave up on changing the past because it would prevent him from living a peaceful life with his family, but then he entered the loop again to save his wife. 

I also like that you don't know the full extent of things at the end. Does he still remember the looping, or was he swallowed by the mushi and only the wife is looping now? It does not give the answers, which in this case is a good thing.
>> ARTICLE
I think it may have been hinted that he did remember, because of the difference in his expression in the last loop when he's holding the branch for her. He's not in awe of her beauty like he seemed to be the other times. He's just kind of fixed on her, as if he's thinking "This girl is going to be my wife. This time we'll get to the end." When in reality she's going to have to go through the same thing he's had to go through. Maybe that's just me overthinking things.
>> ARTICLE
No kidding, that's one of the best episodes of an anime I have seen in quite a while.

*Oh my God.* Even for Mushishi, that was something else. That cold opening, that atmosphere of uneasiness. A powerful little story.

Im confused. Idk where to ask. I thought these were all out, how come the threads are just now showing up? Or am i missing something?

Huh? What exactly are you asking? This thread is for the second half of the 2nd season, which is airing right now (first half of the second season aired is the spring).

I just looked it up and that was what i was missing! Basically i just found out there's more to see. Im pretty happy right now.

I was chanting "no no no..." when he saw that tunnel and was so relieved when he decided not to go in. Then that ending... ;__;

What happens next?! T_T This week's episode has definitely been one of most engaging.

I started crying when he started walking away from the tunnel, then again when I realized what was going to happen with the wife. Mushishi is the only thing to ever effect me so strongly so consistently, I'll be so sad when it's gone.

Why isn't this being talked about more? :/. Aside from that best episode of Mushishi so far in my opinion even though I am still collecting what is left of my shattered heart off the floor, episode did what it set out to do 10/10
>> ARTICLE
Time loop episode? Fuck yes! This and the winter mountain god episode are my favorite episodes. 

This episode is what I love about Mushishi. The atmosphere, the pacing, the execution were all perfect. I felt Kaoru's emotions, from confusion (all the jumps successfully confused me despite already knowing the time loop was happening), to worry, to relief (he steps back from the the tunnel), happiness (he sees something he never had before, and hugs Iku), to desperation (when he sees the tunnel carrying Iku on his back, I was yelling at the screen) and then sadness as he walked through. I was close to tears as the credits rolled. I loved the loop from Iku's POV, too. I think it made the ending even more effective. Mushishi is the best.
>> ARTICLE
AOTY
>> ARTICLE
Anybody else think this episode was extremely Nietzschean? The man who walks through the tunnel thinks he has the opportunity to perfect his life, so he creates a "Real World" in his head opposite the "Apparent World" that he sees. In the Real World he never accuses that boy of breaking the vase and his wife never falls. Because he is obsessed with the imperfections of his life he becomes unable to appreciate his life, and in the end he dooms his wife to the same fate, and the viewer is lead to believe that he never really saves her.

These last two episodes of Mushi-Shi have been so powerful and emotional, here's hoping the trend continues!

That was simply incredible.

So simple but so powerful, fresh, and beautiful a story.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi certainly is doing way better than the past half of the season. The number one reason I love this anime is not the music or the peaceful settings but the fact that the storytelling always steers away from the cliche and pays respect to the viewer by not taking the direction they'd expect. Time loops/deja vu are certainly exhausted topics in media but due to a couple twists, this episode felt very original.
>> ARTICLE
What a beautiful episode.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely amazing. Probably my favorite episode of all the ones in second season so far. The atmosphere combined with the exquisite story telling and calming OST manages to engage me so well that I'm attached by 5 minutes. I usually like less the episodes that adult Ginko isn't really present but this episode was so compelling that it made me forgive that. The story is a bit cliche and the lack of the usual OP was a bit disappointing but the execution of the episode and how well it was done makes up for that. I couldn't wrap my head around something this episode and I think its that the character designs seemed a little more complicated than usual, or something along those lines. I didn't cry but did get numerous shivers down my spine. Can't write enough to convey how happy I am that this series is back this season.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a little confused at what happened in the end.  Did he join the Mushi and now his wife is the one trapped?  Or do they both just have Deja Vu?  

Also, if she is the only one trapped, I wonder how she would  enter the tunnel again, as she only entered it because he chose not to and then later chose to...so confused!

On a silly side note, that must be the most powerful Mushi able to turn back all of time over and over again! 
>> ARTICLE
Watching it again:

Kaoru got assimilated into the mushi, since he knew about it before going in, and no longer is looping. Only Iku is now.

Makes me wonder how Ginko knows these things that can't possibly be known by anyone not directly involved.
>> ARTICLE
>Makes me wonder how Ginko knows these things that can't possibly be known by anyone not directly involved.

Of course we can't know for sure. But Mushishi is a show that let you imagine every possibility :)

Here's mine : I guess the only way for Ginko and all mushishis to know about this mushi is because one mushishi, in the distant past, has been trapped by this type of mushi. He probably walked through the tunnel at some point, not realizing what he was doing, just out of curiosity. After experiencing enough loops, he could remember enough to realize his condition, and began to "study" the tunnel. In its "last looped life" (whatever that means), he probably sent records to Tan'yuu. However he probably did not send records about his whole (looped) life (it would have been a big book !). He kept it short, because he knew the mushi enough to know there's no easy solution. He might have written the strict and factual minimum, something like :  
"Hey fellows, I found a new mushi. Here are the characteristics : shape/appearance of the mushi ; fragrance at night ; symptoms of "dj-vu" and anxiousness we experience when we are affected. Here's what it means, what the mushi does : time loops ! From now on, you will be able to detect it. However I found no cure, and it's impossible for a mushishi to investigate it more, at least safely (unless another mushishi than me gets trapped). Just stay away from those dark tunnels and be aware when someone talks about dj-vu."

Ginko says "I never heard of a case where someone could change the past". However he can't know for sure, since he doesn't know in details the life of the first mushishi who found the mushi. For Ginko, the first mushishi could not change the past and had no choosing over its life, he was trapped, and that's precisly why its precious records could have been passed to Tan'yuu and other mushishis. For the person affected, it looks like it's possible to make some choices (feeling of free will). For the outside world, it seems that people affected by the mushi only had "one life/one timeline". It's indeed impossible to know everything about their life, you can only have a grasp if they left written traces or testimonies in their last timeline.

It means that the other cases that Ginko talks about are just cases similar to the one we see in the episode. Mushishis are aware of this mushi, so they write about cases of "dj-vu" when they think it's mushi-related. We can suppose that Ginko will send a record of this story to Tan'yuu : "Hey, I found Kairou case ! Here's a brief description of the story". The last Ginko's record that will be passed to other mushishis in the distant future (after Ginko) will be different. It will be the last testimony he will hear and write from Kaoru, or Iku, or both, or no testimony at all in fact. Because we always describe what we feel, the last testimony will not be "Once, I changed the event by walking away the tunnel, and I experienced a life never experienced before". Instead, the ultimate testimony will be tainted by anxiousness : "In fact, as far as I remember, I always lived a life already lived, except maybe for my very first timeline before I crossed the mushi's path at something like 70, or when I chose to walk away the path to increase my total life by 2 or 3 years. But it doesn't matter anyway, in the end, maybe I never realy had a choice. In the end, as of right now, there's not a second of my life that I didn't live already."

And the next mushishi in the future will do the same thing that Ginko did, he will say to the patient "I read some records on this mushi, the last one was from Ginko, and again the report states that it's impossible to change the past. My only advice is to walk away the tunnel when you encounter it, maybe you will get a few more "fresh" years (but only for one or two loops top) before being consumed". Note that the mushishi should not destroy all of the patient's hopes by predicting that he will never get out of the mushi influence and live an unexpected life ^^

This theory holds only if the mushishi (Ginko in this case) does not try to go visit the couple in the future (when they are old). So the question is now why Ginko did not go visit Kaoru more frequently to see how the situation evolved, since he did so in other episodes/cases (like S1E15 "Pretense of Spring" and S1E04 "The Pillow Pathway").

EDIT : TL;DR : Ginko got a record by a mushishi affected by the Kairou mushi. People affected by the mushi have a feeling of free will but for the outside word they can't change the past. What mushishis can learn is only from rare testimonies and sources from the "last timeline" lived by the people affected. There are probably many plotholes and implicit assumptions, and it's just one of the many interpretations we can have with this marvelous show. So don't take it for THE explanation, just my thoughts.
>> ARTICLE
I think they are both trapped. By the time he asks Ginko about the mushi, though, she'll be asleep again. She won't find out, and everything will play out like it did before. We didn't see her really engage with Ginko at all, so she might never ask him about it. 
>> ARTICLE
>Did he join the Mushi and now his wife is the one trapped? Or do they both just have Deja Vu? 

It's left intentionally ambiguous which one of those happened. The show also ends before we see her get to her choice. Will choosing not to enter the tunnel lead to her fall off the cliff? Will the husband still remember everything and somehow save her? We don't know.

 The show is not about the end result of the time-loop, but about the reasons behind his choices. He initially got caught in the loop because he wanted to change his past, however when he gave up on that he was finally able to live further with his family. But when his wife is dying the mushi tempts him again. Are they now reliving their lives over and over again together? Is the wife alone in the loop and will she die when she exists? No one knows. But he chose to try to save her that way not knowing what the results would be, which is why we don't know. All he knew is that she would loop like he did, and even if that meant him becoming one with the mushi he was willing to make that sacrifice to save her.

>> ARTICLE
so this episode is very subtle and powerful.. That's why i love mushishi, it has a very strong philosophy undertone that makes you think.. The superb art and music just enhance the experience.
some questions i have

Was changing the past really impossible? I felt like the scene in which Ginko was asked about Kaoru dejavu happened only once in his numerous loops. Because when he decided to not go inside the cave again, he thought of what Ginko had told him previously. 

Was  Kaoru aware of him being under the effect the mushi the second when he decided to bring his dying wife inside the mushi? 


>> ARTICLE
When Kaoru learns about his condition from Ginko, what we see is the continuation of that same timeline. So when he steps away from the tunnel, he essentially continues his life and leaves the loop. Basically he re-enters the tunnel, because that was the only way to save his wife in his opinion since he already knew what the mushi does.
>> ARTICLE
Well done! I mean seriously, well done to the creators because this was brilliant! Not only is it a time loop episode, which can go very wrong very quickly if done badly, but it's coming off the tail of Ginko's back story, something that's difficult to just walk away from.

Man this episode is awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Man, right when I saw they omitted the opening I knew this episode was going to be special.

It was.
>> ARTICLE
Masterpiece. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that was a top tier episode. I mean they're all good, but this was fantastic. If you knew you could go back in time would you? Try to fix your regrets? Or accept them and move on? Good theme this week. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if you were being rhetorical or not, but the episode made me wonder if I would keep on entering that loop or not. I think I would, it'd be wonderful to relive some moments of my life. But that's the instant gratification side of me, and the idea of just being slightly aware that there isn't a single new experience in your life is absolutely terrifying. With every loop getting just a bit more unsettling, that would be complete madness. This episode gave me chills.
>> ARTICLE
That was pretty scary, getting stuck in a loop then having your wife stuck in the loop as well.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. This is probably the best episode of Mushishi so far.
>> ARTICLE
I was expecting him to unconsciously alter the future by saving the kid, which leads to him to not meet his future wife and somewhat *saves* her from her death. He will then live a completely different life with a different family, job, everything. That would have been very bitter sweet.

This version is pretty awesome too though.
>> ARTICLE
I can totally see this plot work in a movie (there has probably been one already).
>> ARTICLE
Just when he made it out of the loop, the future got something else in store for him.Sure, the guy is alive in his wife's loop but I cant help but to feel that the original looping guy is dead, the warning from Ginko pretty much confirms it.Great episode, I knew something good is coming since there was no OP.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know how many episodes this is getting?
>> ARTICLE
This is second cour, so it's probably no more than 13.
>> ARTICLE
he said he wanted to see the future more than altering the past.. then took his wife back to the past.. wot?
this guy basically ruin the lives of hundreds of ppl working in the saki refinery cuz he was being a dick to a kid.. coulda changed that but decided to move on with his life instead..

mushishi created some dude again you dont know whether to feel sorry or not cuz his decision making is completely shit.
>> ARTICLE
You've got the entire thing wrong.

The one who was stuck in the loop was the man only, not the entire village. He 'saved' his wife by making her get stuck in the loop too, instead of dying like she probably would if he tried to get her to a doctor. Also note that Ginko warned him not to go into the cave ever again, otherwise he might become part of the Mushi itself. Thus, we could conclude that he sacrified himself to make his wife live, even though she would live in the loop only. Anyway, we'll never be sure of what really happened, since the episode didn't explain what happened later.
>> ARTICLE
Put yourself in that situation and 99 times out of 100, a normal guy like you or me would probably give into that temptation, not keeping big picture consequences in mind. Also realize that in the episode, those who feel that uneasiness of Deja vu were only those that entered the cave. 

This isn't a case of Mushishi creating a character you're not sure you feel sorry for, it's a case of you as a viewer failing to realize the situation and context that led to the character making a reasonable and relatable decision. 
>> ARTICLE
The last scene with Ginko and the Mushi is just too good. Need to see more of him interacting with Mushi.
>> ARTICLE
Typical Ginko. I was expecting him to kill the mushi or mushi-banish it in some way, but instead he befriends it. A good example of his character, and how he views mushi and people and two entities living in the same world. 
>> ARTICLE
Why would you expect Ginko kill it? Throughout Mushishi S1 he's adamant in not kill the mushi unless required.
>> ARTICLE
You're right, I just think this mushi in particular is pretty dangerous. The girl almost dies here. But I guess it is out in the wilderness where it's mostly animals that it encounters, and that's just nature happening. I'm sure Ginko brings it someplace even more out of the way. 
>> ARTICLE
Hell even when "required" he didn't do it sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
What this girl really needed was some of that lake water because she was thirsty as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
Dealing with loneliness, huh? There's definitely something here everyone can relate to on some level. This was really good as a bit of an inspiring story about how not to forget how much we have going for us just by being alive when swamped with depression, and moving on towards the future. To just be alive as a person is truly wonderful.

It's also nice to see a somewhat comical moment in Mushishi, since I feel like we haven't gotten a good one in a while. The expressions Ginko had when Masumi said he wasn't bad looking were great.
>> ARTICLE
Ginko's "huh?" expressions are always the best.
>> ARTICLE
It's official I'm obsessed with this show. I have a question for manga readers. Does it look like they're going to cover everything in the manga this season? If not about how much do you estimate would be left?
>> ARTICLE
I'm trying to find the source, but I can't seem to find it at the moment. Will update when I do, but I believe this season (which is split into 2 cour, the second cour being the Fall) will cover the entire manga.

>> ARTICLE
I think so, if i remember correctly there are 10 volumes of the manga, each volume has 5 chapters which as an episode worth in the anime, the first seasons covered 5 volumes worth of material, they have 5 more to go which gives us a full 25 episode season 2 to completely finish off the material. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't season 2 meant to be 12 episodes that's what MAL says
>> ARTICLE
It's split into two cour. The second cour of this season runs in the Fall.
>> ARTICLE
Damn I didn't know that. I'm so excited now!
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to say, because they don't animate it in order which stories are presented in manga. It doesn't matter though, because stories aren't really connected (there are exactly two characters other than Ginko that appear in more than one episode, not counting TV special), and sometimes one episode spans through year in-universe, during which we can assume Ginko is doing other stuff than "exorcising" Mushi Of The Week.

I'd give manga a go anyway, even though I think anime is the superior version (that soundtrack...).
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to read it anyway I was just hoping to see all the content in video form first
>> ARTICLE
You may want to start with manga. I think anime is the superior version, so save the best for last.
>> ARTICLE
I've already seen everything that's out so far I even own the DVDs for season 1 and I never buy DVDs
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to be self-obsessed for a moment and say that from last week or so up until the night before last, I spent my nights being angsty over death when, as young as I am, I have no place feeling that way. I got a pep talk two nights ago and it's left me feeling a lot better.

With that in mind, this episode was exactly the kind of reaffirmation I needed of the views that I was presented with. We're lucky to be alive, even moreso to lead normal lives that come with both happiness and sadness. There are people and beings in the world that're much worse off than ourselves, no matter how much we might not think that when we're down in the dumps. This was such a wonderful episode with the kind of simple but often-overlooked message that everyone should think about.

1. Yes, Mushishi cares less about its people, [but the backdrops are gorgeous](http://i.imgur.com/oDGlCF0.jpg).

1. The original ends up being replaced by the mirror-image, literally a changeling!

1. Mirror, and the mirror-lake. Her beau wanted her to be gentler, and the mushi makes her weaker. To combat him she'll have to polish her mirror, which is to accept her beau's departure.

1. Also, she contracted the mushi cause she went to the lake, unwilling to give up on her beau and polish her mirror.

1. But there, on the verge of losing herself, she reached for the mirror, and crawled with all her strength towards the light. The urge to preserve herself had kicked in.

You say that (and yes, they are gorgeous) but I really think this new season is not at all deserving of that characterization. The first season, definitely, but I'd say that S2 has really been about people and personal journeys and development, compared to S1. I'd say that applies to all the S2 episodes, but episodes 2 and 3 especially spring to mind, and this one was hardly an exception. I've been pretty much blown away by how much more I like season 2 because of this, considering I adored season 1.
>> ARTICLE

Oooooohhhh. Actually I've been impressed by the visual distinction of the characters this season compared to S1 as well, but S1 only had like 6 different character designs so that's not really that impressive yeah

You should just watch it. If you've already seen at least a few episodes of the first season, you know what's going on. The show is so episodic that you won't be missing anything by picking up the second season now. There's no sudden 10-episode story arch in season 1.

That recommendation is just for people that want to join in on the discussions of course.

Ginko as a character has the capacity to be an amazing mc even if he is not the main focus of the episode, which is what the new season has been doing. I'm loving this. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope I came early enough to get an answer. I haven't watched the first season. I tried to, but I got bored with the first episode. It seemed like nothing was happening, and that nothing was going to happen. Like a slice of life show.

Is that true? Or does the first season get better? What is it **really** about anyway? The summaries don't tell me anything at all.

Do I even need to watch the first season to try to watch this one?

The series is episodic which means you could jump into any episode any part into the series and understand everything that is going on.

> Do I even need to watch the first season to try to watch this one?

Nope. There's like one episode that go over Ginko's past and things like that, but all of that is insignificant in the grand scheme of things if you ask me. That episode does help explain why Ginko does what he does and acts how he acts, but the show doesn't necessarily feel lost without it. Don't get me wrong though, that particular episode was a really good episode and a nice, welcome addition to the series.

The series, both season 1 and season 2, is just a collection of short, isolated stories with virtually no common factor except for our main character who serves as the catalyst to move each story along. The only other recurring characters are one of Ginko's friends who collects mushi artifacts (and he's not even in the show that much) and arguably the woman who does the voiceover at the beginning of each episode. You do find out who she is in one episode though.

If you want some grand, over-arching story, this isn't the series. You could probably watch any episode in any order and everything  about the show would still make 100% complete sense to you.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, you answered my questions *very well*. This, being a collection of short & *isolated* stories, is certainly not the show for me. I gave the first episode of season one a go, but if I do try to watch the show again I'll bear in mind that I can jump in at any point.

This is the only show that leaves me consistently unable to articulate how fantastic it is. I loved the atmosphere in this episode. It was pretty dark, but the ending can be considered either happy or sad depending on how you look at it.

That too. I think they really botched that scene up. Could have been much more emotion packed.

To be fair its arguably one of the few times hes had his life directly threatened, let alone the drugged girl. The only other episodes I can remember him taking such big decisions were again threatening ones, the island with the aging and reviving girl, and the plant/children hivemind one.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting linguistic note: the Japanese verb "moeru" has two different meanings. One, written as , means "to burn or catch fire," and the other, written as , means "to sprout, bud, or bloom." I don't think this dual meaning was actually incorporated into the script (The gardener uses the verb "moeutsuru" () which is only used to describe spreading fire), but I thought it was neat that one verb in Japanese can be used to describe both the tree burning and the tree blossoming.
>> ARTICLE
Ginko is a traveler, he loves the land, and that's how people behave, so it makes sense for him to observe the local famous spots, even if he doesn't think mushi will be involved.

The famous cherry tree that wasn't the king's new clothes! :o

"We are not doctors, but mere gardeners. We graft from a beautiful tree to a resilient one, to form a resilient one which blooms beautifully." And he asked the girl whose mother is ill if she is healthy. Does he also graft health between people? Hm.

The talk of the graft indeed. Saho draws sustenance from the tree, but the tree also seems to mirror her health, so perhaps when another eats the foam, Saho and the tree can then mirror *their* health, to get energy back Saho is the beautiful cherry tree, and this girl is the resilient one.

Ginko, taking a moral stand! Not only telling someone that what they are doing is wrong, but moving to stop them!

The travelers, is it that when you let nature run its course, it will find a way, and remain beautiful, or perhaps that the danger still lurks close by?

It surely felt like a *different* sort of Mushishi episode. Though it dealt with the same issues, and in a similar way, just having Ginko take such decisive action make it feel different.

>> ARTICLE
What a fantastic episode. It's interesting that we have our first villainous character that I can remember. Most of the cast of the show fell into a neutral-good demeanor but the gardener's actions were the first to border on evil. It's an interesting addition considering the antagonist are usually mushi, and not humans. 
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of how morally wrong what he and his family did I wouldn't call it evil since it's for the sake of protecting Saho. I would only really consider hurting people for the sake of hurting people to be evil. 
>> ARTICLE
What the hell is wrong with you.

>> ARTICLE
Uhm... well... I see you hadn't considered having eternally young, beautiful, alive fuckdoll.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if you could consider Mushi evil, though. The way they're portrayed, they're more like parasites at worst - out for themselves and their own survival, and if people are harmed because of that, then it comes across as very incidental. I'd put that also as neutral rather than evil, if people *weren't* harmed then the Mushi would be dead. They don't have much other choices available, and in the vast majority of cases, don't even seem to be sentient enough / have the intellect to pick a different path.

Humans, on the other hand, are always shown to have more agency - I'm not sure if Mushi have enough of that to actually be evil. It's very much about intentions, I'd figure, like 'you didn't HAVE to hurt that person, you would have incurred no personal loss if you hadn't hurt that person, but you hurt them anyway for your own (not entirely necessary) self gain'. 

Based on how Mushi are portrayed, I don't think they're actually able to do that sort of thing. At least in the stories that Ginko finds himself in, it's always very - 'they can't help being that way'. Even with the hivemind plant, that was just how it propagated / grew. While it did act as a parasite off humans, what it was actually doing was no more inherently evil than a human couple also propagating and growing their own family - and at the end of the day, the stronger species wins. 

It's all fun to think about. 

**Edit:** Oh - also this dude isn't the first villainous character. Pretty sure the dad from the episode from S1 with the girl who aged and died every night and who was born again the next morning would count as evil too! Especially because (similarly to this one) he was kind of forcing stuff onto people. 
>> ARTICLE
I knew I was forgetting a human antagonist, thanks for pointing it out. Also I never meant to say that Mushi are evil, they are the perfect embodiment of neutral imo. They just exist how they are supposed to, and that can sometimes lead to problems for humans. 
>> ARTICLE
That was darker than I was expecting. I was expecting dark but not the level of decapitating innocents to swap heads levels of dark fuckery. 

And despite all that the episode was beautiful with the scenery and the music 
>> ARTICLE
I loved the little bit at the end that accentuated the beauty of cherry blossoms. Truly the trees in full bloom are a fantastic sight...
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this episode brings about an air of ignorance and the unknown. Even for Ginko who is a Mushi-shi that researches these unknown creatures  called Mushi, there are also the unknown actions that the more familiar humans can take. 

There are people out there that would make sacrifices and put burdens on themselves and others in order to preserve that which they are accustomed with as shown as the man's family killing people for generations to keep the woman alive. 

This is what I love about this anime. Ever since the first season, this anime has gotten me to think more about what I don't know as well as ponder on what I do know. It's a mind-blowing experience and I love it.

Goddamn it, I want to watch it now but it's past 12am. Every single time I've tried to watch Mushishi when it's past midnight, I fall asleep halfway through. I'm familiar with the chapter from the manga, though. It should be interesting to watch - this is really an adaptation that adds a lot to the source material. Guess it's worth a try at least, though. Maybe this time I can stay awake!

Also, funnily enough, I was thinking about it the other day - Mushishi feels a lot like some kind of super tranquil mashup between The Twilight Zone and X-files for me. I was a huge fan of both of those when I was younger, so that's... not a bad thing at all, actually. The twists and plots are very Twilight Zone, the persistent protagonist who researches on ~~aliens~~ Mushi and the consistent world with its own set of rules is more X-files. 

I'm going to miss this when it's over. 

**Edit:** Managed to stay awake this time. The scene where it flowers before it dies was very nicely rendered. And as far as cherry blossoms go, one thing that struck out to me when I first saw them in real life is how transient they were. It was kind of startling - in anime they're all over the place to the point of appearing like some sort of weird permanent mental landscape fixture, then in real life they all bloom at once, then are gone in a couple of days and everything looks boring again. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow the discussions for this show are pretty low. I am oddly surprised by that.

This episode definitely feels more decisive than usual. Ginko was put in a situation that called for response and he did.

I am curious how the first generation knew if they put her head on another body it would let her live...

The scene with the flowers floating off her body reminded me of a similar scene at the end of Mawaru Penguindrum.

Ah, for once I expected Ginko to bust some moves (manga be damned, I consider Mushishi anime to be a superior version), knock the nutter gardener down and escape with the unconscious girl.  
Instead I got the lamest kick in the history of animation.

Great episode, as always.

He was taking the smartest action, getting the girl and getting the fuck out. Attacking the gardener could have cost him his life and the life of that innocent girl.

The *real* issue is why didn't the gardener attack Ginko? Animation budget ran out? I was hoping for gardener to jump at Ginko with an axe, Ginko flooring him/stunning him for a moment, grabbing unconscious girl and bailing out. But let's suppose kicking the fuck out of a lantern was a better choice.  
Why did the kick looked so slow, lame and impotent? Ginko might be a stoner, but lugging that huge, wooden backpack must have trained all of his muscles.
>> ARTICLE
It wasnt a trained soccer kick just "Ack look fire!" The gardener is crazy, his thought wasn't I have to kill that Mushishi instead all he could think about was getting his plant woman away from the fire.
>> ARTICLE
There is so many shitty adaptations that serve only as a source material advertisement, they're unfinished, they rush through the material or they get crappy anime original endings.

But Mushishi got a perfect adaptation, from start to finish, with great visuals and sound to back it up, and I love it. Finishing that with a movie is the perfect way to end this series.

I'm going to miss this anime so much, it has such a great atmosphere and is so relaxing, no other anime is like this.

It was the type of ending that felt right for Mushishi. On the the one hand it was yet another adventure with Ginko and his journey continues on, but on the other hand there was a sense of finality to that ultimate message about beings, nature, and laws being bound together. A beautiful finale to one of the most beautiful anime of all time.

I am sad that it's over, but the satisfaction of finishing an anime and knowing the story is actually over is something I don't get to experience often. So most of all, I'm thankful for the journey. It was beautiful in every way. It was my favourite show I've ever seen since the first episode that I saw of it.

I'd rather see it end as a beautiful piece of art than for it to go on for too long just for the sake of continuing. 
>> ARTICLE
[It got my hopes up for a happy ending](http://i.imgur.com/vauqcpO.jpg) but Nature's Law was not having any of it.

The human drama was a bit emotionally weak compared to other episodes with a similar subject matter dealing with separation. Perhaps because it wasn't a big focus. This two-parter was more about the lore that intertwines the mushi, nature and humans.

A bit sad it's all over. Languid, quiet and atmospheric storytelling and drama is a rarity. The new Aria OVAs should fill the void a bit but I'm holding out hopes for the continuation of Natsume's Book of Friends.
>> ARTICLE
I found the third season overall to be just a touch lower in standard than the first two, in terms of the human/emotional element. Not sure if it was conscious directorial decisions but they didn't seem to quite strike that sweet spot in pacing and development that they did before... it must be hard to hit those notes consistently over ~50 episodes and not get clichd though. I'm glad they avoided that and ended on a relative high. Fantastic show.

I woke up this morning and really felt like watching some Mushishi and started wondering when the movie was coming. Now I've got something to look forward to when I get home tonight.
>> ARTICLE
So, did you get home and watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yup! I really liked it, though I'm not sure if I wanted some more finality from the series. It seemed like just another episode. I liked this because it fit with the rest of the show, but I still kinda wanted some form of closure.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I see where you're coming from. A little part of me actually didn't mind Ginko becoming the new lord of the mountain and surrendering his humanity or losing the ability to see mushi as the price for breaking the law. It would have made me sad, but at least it would have been...final.

But then again, that's never what Mushishi ever was, was it? It was never a show about Ginko. If it was, it would imply Ginko was "chosen" or somewhat special by bringing characters from his past, like most anime do with their protagonists. I was worried that when Ginko (a human) went into the circle of light willingly, something that is considered a nigh-impossible event, they would make it all anime-ish by having the circle of light exclaim something like "I-Impossible! No human has ever breached this mushi barrier. What special powar?!"

But that never happened, thankfully. In true Mushishi fashion, the entire thing went about it in a matter-of-fact way.

Mushishi was a moving show with a protagonist that was mostly stone-faced, because it wasn't really about the protagonist and it truly wasn't the people that moved me either. It was the world itself that captured my heart. It was a show that simply showcased the world and how humanity, with all its myriad of emotions and decisions, was still just a speck in the grand scheme of things and that nature always was and always will just... *be*.

At the end of the day, it seems Mushishi never attempted to tell one long story, with a beginning, middle and end. There was no hero just as there was no victim because all the stories were never a case of right or wrong as the humans are just as much victims as the mushi themselves. It was what it was - nature, playing its own little game, with no winners or losers. It just so happened to be told through the eyes of an ordinary wandering tradesman. 

That's Mushishi. And as much as I wanted some sort of finality or closure, that's Mushishi. It came, and it left, not with a bang, but with a beautiful hum.

That turned out to be a long wall of text. Just typed as my thoughts flowed. Oh well.

So great to hear that OP again. It's so great to see Mushishi again. I think it's the only show that can be absolutely slow and still manage to keep my attention. The atmosphere was so spot on. The use of silence especially. I really liked the parts with Kumado as a child. 

So hyped for the second cour.
>> ARTICLE
Epic sound direction as usual, the way they use the silence and the music really helps to convey emotions, Mushishi has by far the best sound direction of all the anime I've watched so far. The voice acting was great especially Kumado's grandfather, the scene where he replaced Kumado's soul was very touching and the great voice acting really helped bringing that scene together.   
Overall it was a very good special but it didn't leave me with the usual Mushishi aftertaste, most of the stories in Mushishi have something to teach and a hidden meaning behind them but this story felt almost hollow to me, it could have been an artistic decision by the writer who knows, after all this story was about an empty man.

How so? These are the 2 unaired episodes from the 2nd season thus making them episode 11 and 12.

Edit: I now get what you meant. The reason I did it like this is because the name is "Mushishi Zoku Shou Special" and these episodes were aired simultaneously thus making them episode 1 of the special.
>> ARTICLE
Well, this episode was certainly straightforward. While *Mushishi* is often a little ambiguous on its ideas, this episode presented itself as a fairly clear cut parable on acceptance and forgiveness. An issue with many parables is that their ideas and execution are often a little predictable, making them less interesting.

The episode did a good job of stepping around that- the red sea was a unique, unexpected parallel to the previous accident and really drove the point home. Although I'm a little less convinced regarding the pearl and I felt that episode was somewhat forgettable, at least the ideas came off clear. I'm satisfied.

The sequence with the birds at the end was terrific, so let's have a webm (warning- there's audio):

1. [**21:34.436 - 21:47.751** - Migratory Birds](http://a.pomf.se/wccpev.webm)
>> ARTICLE
I think you missed a large part of the episode then. The man on the cliff was advocating the ethical view that since society didn't save his wife, he has no cause to be a part of that society. As society is only good so long as each villiager is treated equally. Problem was, the elder saved his wife first. He immediately changed his life two following the womans death and started the fish farm, ensuring that in no way such an event will ever occur again. 

The episode itself in the "present tense" was expressed that they both agree on the same thing: Needless death(suffering) shouldn't happen if we come together. If we don't come together, then needless death will occur. So like the man on the cliff said, if such was the case we could only rely on ourselves. 

therefore, the elder crying at the end was not ONLY because of forgiveness, but also the realization that the man on the cliff never truly disagreed with the elder at all. The man on the cliff only wanted to guarantee that "his own" was protected. This gives great honor to the man on the cliff, and now the village is duty bound by his sacrifice to uphold the same principles that the elder was doing all those years. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to assume that you're responding to "I'm a little less convinced regarding the pearl". Here's how I saw the episode:

Sakichi chose to evacuate the village because, as you said, he felt that the only definitive person capable of protecting himself and those he cared about is himself, a product of guilt for not being present to save his wife. He showcases this by instructing Mina this exact lesson a couple times throughout the episode. The village elder, who also feels guilty for electing not to rescue Sakichi's wife, claims the opposite by warning Sakichi how dangerous his isolation can be, especially for Mina. Ginko further justifies that claim with his advice on dealing with the songbird mushishi.

With the coming of the red sea, Sakichi comes to an epiphany and asserts that "there was nothing that could have been done", accepting that, well, there was nothing that could have been done to save his wife (thus the aforementioned parallelism). In pretty much the next scene, he offers the pearl to help save the village in trade for his reentry to it, effectively forgiving the man riddled with guilt for not rescuing his wife. 

It was never a matter of honor, equality, or social policy- the episode ran on the same theme that runs through most of Mushishi: **the acceptance of fatalism and only doing what can be done**.

As for why I didn't like the pearl? It was written in to purely serve the role as a plot device for resolving a conflict. You could have swapped it out for buried underwater treasure or stashed valuable paintings and it would have had zero difference to the narrative. If that isn't a deus ex machina, I don't know what is.

I thought it was a rather memorable episode, if for no other reason than that scene.  It was really beautiful and one of those little things that make Mushishi so amazing.

Ginko has western clothes, not just that, out of time, to show how he is an outsider, how he doesn't belong. I always wondered at that, especially since the timeframe is all wrong for the way he's dressed as well.

Ginko, always curious what is going on in every place he visits, but will not pass judgment, will not tell a father how to raise his daughter. He's less of a people person, and more of a *communities'* person.

And that's today's message, delivered with a phenomenon looking the same - We are small, and nature is big and powerful. Things happen, and we must keep on living.

And of course, the message about joining power, protecting your own kind, versus only protecting yourself.

Not the best acting. Almost as if some of the actors here are just people pulled from the street. [This felt *so real* ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/pjRM8LQ.jpg)

Oddly enough Ginko's clothes never seemed out of place to me. Maybe it was because early on I assumed it was more of a contemporary setting. The first few episodes show isolated houses rather than whole villages and its hard to get a feel for the exact setting. By the time I got shown places that were obviously less developed than what Ginko's clothing would imply, I was already so used to his clothes that I never gave it a second thought.
>> ARTICLE
Same boat as you, didn't realize at first it wasn't a contemporary setting.  Although I did think it was odd eventually, it never bothered me.  I guess for the same reasons tundra mentioned, he never fit in anyway.
>> ARTICLE
On the acting:

I loved the 2 little girls voices,

and the moment you highlight there I thought was not that bad it is the cry of mixed relief and pride and shame from a hard man that has his village saved by the woman's husband whom he felt responsible for the death of. (is this making sens grammatically?)

I also think that all the acting is played very low key on purpose and it was also the case on the first season. this might very well be a conscious directing decision and I for one like it.
>> ARTICLE
> I loved the 2 little girls voices

Me too, but I have no idea why I thought they were so much better than voices from other series.
>> ARTICLE
That's because Mushishi casts real children instead of adults emulating a children's voice. The real thing sounds much more natural.
>> ARTICLE
Man, this show just operates on a whole other level. That was great and the ending scene was pretty amazing stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking gorgeous 
>> ARTICLE
One of the thing that I find incredible about this series is that it can make me actually care about the characters and story line in only one episode. That's really tough to do in episodic anime, but this series does it every episode. Hell, some anime can't even do that in an entire series. It just shows you how brilliant the storytelling is in Mushishi. Also, LOVE that OP. It's so perfect for this series.
>> ARTICLE
>Also, LOVE that OP. It's so perfect for this series.

Yeah! It's quite distinctive, and she has a great voice.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the feelings of foreboding this show gives me are great. The messages this episode sent were all about protection. Everyone's doing their best to protect what they can - Sakichi and his daughter, the elder and the village, all of the Warbling Shells, and later, Sakichi and the village. It's these kinds of messages that make me love this show. 
>> ARTICLE
Guys, I don't know if everyone realizes how amazing this is, but holy shit.  Like, this is REAL.  This is HAPPENING.  It's like when fans of Star Wars waited years for new a new Star Wars movie.  Except here, the goods were actually delivered!  Like, this NEVER happens.  It's so late at night that it's early the next day and I can't sleep because it rocks my mind that we're getting more of one of my top5 favorite shows of all time.
>> ARTICLE
When I was watching the first episode and the OP song came on, I had that feeling wash over my entire body. Like, a "Life is so good right now" kind of feeling. I don't even remember feeling that way about anything else except for this show.
>> ARTICLE
That was a really sweet and happy episode.  It was quite simple, but really effective.  Their isn't really much to say that hasn't already been said though. :x
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi must be the most relaxing anime that came to existance...
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is so good at building human relationships and drama in just 20 minutes.
>> ARTICLE
This has got to be one of my favourite if not my favourite (One-Eyed Fish in Season 1 was awesome) episode of Mushishi ever. The story was on par with a lot of the better ones, but it was the animation that really caught me. Of course animation quality will have gone up over a span of 8 or so years, but this was incredible. The sunset scenes were so nice, and I feel they animated the clouds of all things really well. Almost like Air (the anime/VN)

On a side note, I LOVE the new OP. 
>> ARTICLE
Communication, forgiveness, connecting with others and reaching out - man, this episode was legit like a fairy tale this time.
>> ARTICLE
So to those who have seen the first season, would you consider it a prerequisite to watch the first season before watching this?
>> ARTICLE
Nope, but there is also no reason to not watch it.
>> ARTICLE
I imagine that we will eventually run into the couple of re-occurring characters in the series. It would probably be in your benefit to knock out the first season and OVA before coming back to this season. Otherwise you wont really understand the relationship they have with the Ginko.
>> ARTICLE
You don't HAVE to, but episode 12 of the first season is highly recommended for Ginko's story.
>> ARTICLE
Not a pre-requisite, really - the plot of either is episodic and there's no overarching plot which requires prior knowledge. I highly recommend it, though - at least watch episode 20 of the first season, so you know who Tanyuu is. 
>> ARTICLE
The first season also gives you a little backstory on Ginko, so while not necessary I'd highly recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
i'm just really glad they still make things like this
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, it seems the theme for the first few episodes are centered on human interaction, rather than Mushi's interactions with humans and how Ginko solves them.
>> ARTICLE
You're totally right, and I think this would not be a positive for the show IF they changed the formula too much. I like that even though Ginko has sort of taken a backseat role so far, he is still present and that he sets up the human interaction. 
>> ARTICLE
Good thing this season changed how characters looked, in the first season they all looked the same and had the same haircut.
>> ARTICLE
Another week, another beautiful "story from grandpa". I would have liked a more concrete explanation as to why all the fish in like a 1 sq. Km area all suddenly bled out, but really that's my only complaint. The artwork was once again beautiful, especially when all of the mushi flew out of the shells at the end of the episode.
>> ARTICLE
The didn't bleed out. A [red tide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tide) is an algal bloom that can kill marine life when in high concentrations.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I didn't even think of that. I suppose I was trying to equate the fish dying with the shark attack, so I naturally assumed blood. Thanks for that.
>> ARTICLE
Parallel imagery. Sakichi comes to understand the futility of both events because they produced a similar picture.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. This was one of the interesting examples of a Mushishi episode wherein the main danger was something that actually exists in the real world. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved the happy ending. It was very satisfying to have them finally reunite and be on good terms again. From every tragedy there is something to be gained and that is certainly true in this case
>> ARTICLE
My God, the ending of the episode with all the Mushi flying away was just amazeballs and so majestic in such a subtle manner. I wonder why I'm so in awe about something as simple as that. Maybe because I was wondering throughout the episode why they were birds inside a seashell, but at the end, it just made *so much* sense on why they were birds. Mushishi is totally the shits.
>> ARTICLE
With each episode comes a new soundtrack for the ending. And I love it so much. How I've missed it, and how I can't wait for the next OST release.
>> ARTICLE
beautiful episode like usual. like the dvd says for the first season this anime really does show What a great anime can be.
>> ARTICLE
This isn't my favorite episode - I feel like Mushishi has already told several "death and resentment" stories, and better ones at that.  I prefer it when the show narrowly focuses on one or two episodic characters, so the slow, muted storytelling has time to really delve deep into their psyches.

But even when Mushishi isn't in top form, it still manages to tell a more nuanced tale with better character development in twenty minutes than many anime can manage in an entire season.  The episodic nature of the show with its Twilight Zone-y old wives tales give it freedom to tell a huge breadth of stories, none of which live long enough to unravel into a jumbled mess.

I was expecting something a little more peculiar and relevant than a pretty pearl to save the town, especially with the way they built up to it earlier on.  Perhaps it could have been his wife's ring or something.  But I guess what's important is that it indicated his forgiveness and willingness to reintegrate with the village.  I also wish they'd focused a little more on the girl who went mute, whose story seemed sidelined and concluded without much fuss. Loved the ending scene with all the flying mushi, that was beautiful.



If I may pose an open discussion question:

 - Would you want a more continuous storyline to develop in Mushishi - say, more exposition on Ginko's background, or the return of characters from previous episodes?

I ask because I was just thinking about how much I loved that the OVA brought back [Tanyuu](http://myanimelist.net/character/13714/Tanyuu_Karibusa) (the mushi scholar) and the short scene depicting all the characters from season one.  Secretly I want Tanyuu back as a love interest, but that could easily hamper the integrity of the story.  Thoughts?
>> ARTICLE
Tanyuu is my favorite character (aside from Ginko of course) so I would love to see more of her, and the OVA hinted that we would. I personally think it would feel odd for this show to suddenly develop a continuous storyline despite my normal dislike for episodic shows. However I would definitely enjoy more and more relations to previous events building up to some kind of multi-episode finale.
>> ARTICLE
Edit: true I answered the wrong person... I'll put this to the correct place and take off what was here.

also I would just like you like to see some more of the back story but it is still possible, it did not come right away in S1 either
>> ARTICLE
I think you meant to reply to tundra, not me. :P

I like the subtle voice acting, especially for the children (which are usually voiced by actual child VAs - ex. [1](http://myanimelist.net/character/16810/Miharu) [2](http://myanimelist.net/character/16881/Ito) [3](http://myanimelist.net/character/16882/Aya) [4](http://myanimelist.net/character/16887/Toyo)).  Sounds much more natural than having an adult woman attempt a cutesy child's voice.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, I actually kind of like this change of pace. Despite beginning as a "death and resentment" story, the show ended on a much, much more positive note. Perhaps it's just because I'm biased towards it's message - forgiveness and reconciliation, communication, and that people need to come together as a community and share resources if they want any chance of "fighting" nature. Many episodes of *Mushishi* sort of end on a "well, that's just life" note, that nature is nature and you can't fight it, only hope it doesn't get worse - the humans usually come out a little worse for the wear. This episode told me "well, nature *may be* nature, but that doesn't mean you don't fight back - but it only works if you work together" and there was a lot of positive change compared to the beginning of the episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's fair, I like both aspects of Mushishi.  It might just be because I recently marathoned the first season, so some of the similar episodes are getting bunched up in my head.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, same, and I know what you're talking about. We haven't had a psychologically-focused episode like that in the new season, but I'm sure it'll pop up soon enough

As for your discussion question, yeah, I'd like to see that. I've thought about it before, and I think having Tanyuu be "cured" for the finale might be an interesting idea. Perhaps have the final few episodes be one arc? Problem is, as much as my inner shipper might *love* to see Tanyuu travel with Ginko (huehue), having Tanyuu complete the sealing of the forbidden mushi would be awfully convenient. Still, the only one I could see being a recurring character with any significance is her - Adashino isn't that compelling of a character.



>> ARTICLE
I hope and suspect they'll bring her back for at least a little bit, but I can't help but think that making her a full-blown love interest would feel like cheap fanservice - not in a pantyshot/boobgrab kind of way of course (save that for the cash-in spinoff *ChibiMushi: Rabu-Rabu*), but in terms of giving the audience exactly what they want.  I'm sure they'd be able to pull it off tastefully though.

Here's what I got out of the story (it's long, sorry!): 

_____

Ibuki's mom died at one point, and his father remarried into a women with children. He began to feel neglected and distant in his household, and began to yearn for his new mother's acceptance and love that she gives to her other children. He became a sailor in order to make her happy and accept him. The gift was a mark of his new job, since he bought it with his own money. Probably to give to his step-mom. When he returned home, notice how she treated him like a stranger. The conversation about him crashing seemed impersonal, almost like they were only neighbors. Even if she's suppose to be his mother, she doesn't treat him like her son.

When Ibuki showed her his shell or whatever thas was, she passed it off as an expensive thing to be sold, and told Ibuki to get rid of it in order to feed her children. She didn't care if he was a sailor, only if he brought money.

Then, when he tells her about the ship crashing, she only cares about the pay. She sees the thing he bought and tells him to sell it, asking why he even had it. The only thing she worries about is her other children, Ibuki doesn't even get the chance to tell her about his new job.

Ibuki becomes resentful. When he was excited about going home and talking to her, he was punished for it. He doesn't think that it's his fault. The conversation Ginko has with him is about how he shouldn't turn his hate into something that will eventually destroy him - that it's not worth it. If something doesn't make him happy, he shouldn't dwell on it. He's old enough to escape a situation like that. That's why he leaves at the end. The stone can be used for both destruction and creation, just like himself. Of course, a lot of this is speculation, but I think it makes sense.

TL;DR: Ibuki wants to be accepted, he's not. He becomes resentful, but then lets his hate go and leaves home.

_____
 
Correct me if there's something I missed or if you think I got something wrong. Either way, fuck yeah! I really liked this episode. Subtle and a bit disjointed, but still really nice. Adashino was a great touch, and the mushi were interesting. I love that kind of light/dark imagery. Flying and slithering creatures make everything better.
>> ARTICLE
I think the last part isn't correct.  [Spoilers](/s "He actively tried to kill his family in the end but only destroyed their house and this maybe the last string in an already failing household.  I don't think he let go of his hate, I think it is just brooding inside him after he ran away.  If he let go of his hate then there was no reason to leave or destroy the house.")
>> ARTICLE
I generally agree but I don't think he was trying [](/s "to kill them") thats seems like a exaggeration it was just a very strong wind.


>> ARTICLE
But he controls how strong the wind blows, he used the max strength whistle.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was more symbolic than literal. Ginko already had the chat with him after all. 

Maybe the wind symbolized a sort-of 'wind of change.' Even though his dad is an asshole, he still goes through with saving his step-mom,. because he knows that his 'needs and wants' will never be met any other way. He also likely sent home pay to pay for the house. I bet he upped the wind level cause of his dad's 'ingrate' comment, though.
>> ARTICLE
**Things in the episode that I liked:**

* Ginko's face when he realized that his best friend is a black market dealer.

* The ability to control the wind and also make holes all over the place. What shall we name this ability? 

* I bet those mushi birds were pretty happy eating those mushi eels.

*Other stuff:*

* what kind of broken home did that sailor come from?

* how expensive was that damn flower?

* Can people be taught that whistling, because if someone just catches on, then thats a whole new bag of worms.
>> ARTICLE

When does that happen exactly? Didn't get the vibe that he is selling it on a black market.
>> ARTICLE
"Black market dealer" was more of joke if anything since he is very sneaky and mischievous.

...Well in the first season he was explained to be a collector of mushi artifacts and he would sometimes trade things with Ginko. So I don't think he is particularly selling the items as he is trading them with other people. And Ginko has items(like the whistle) that can be misuse. Maybe he is more of a customer then a dealer Per Se.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I though I missed a reference to that :)

He seems more like a mushishi pawnshop kind of guy. Buying things cheap and selling them at a slight premium to other mushishis.
>> ARTICLE
I think he is more of a collector. I think this was mentioned previously in the last season.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I got the impression he said he was a "collector" aka. reseller.
>> ARTICLE
He probably does sell of some things to keep himself afloat. But keep the more fascinating things for himself.
>> ARTICLE
Seems like a lot of people didn't like this episode, but I really enjoyed it. 
>> ARTICLE
I am with you on this, I like that most of the episodes leave some questions unanswered, letting us wonder what really happened, like the family issues here. I especially liked the whole idea of mushi's being like the wind 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I thought it was a really good one. I think a lot of people just didn't like it because they thought the sailor needed more backstory to explain his motivations, but I felt everything was pretty strongly implied.

Honestly I think this was among the better episodes, but different people have different priorities.
>> ARTICLE
Her mom's character was basically summed up in just 1 dialogue. When he comes home, she says "Oh, you are alive"

Couldn't be more obvious than that.
>> ARTICLE
So weird that people are not liking this episode. I thought it was one of the best. 

The entire torikaze / mushi eels (don't remember their names) was a great juxtaposition. Loved how the eels loved the sound of whistling because it reminds them of the wind in their holes, when the torikaze themselves (that eat them, thus the mushi eels ignoring the whistle in the day) are basically a mushi version of the wind. It's nothing really insightful, but it just feels incredibly well thought out and well-crafted.

Come to think of it, *Mushishi* is almost starting to feel like modern day myths in the way it describes the mushi counterparts of natural phenomena. I wish I could elaborate more on the show, but I guess part of its charm is the simplicity of its ideas at their core
>> ARTICLE
>  counterparts of natural phenomena

Welcome back Mushishi, you were missed.

I liked how the common superstition that whistling at sea will bring forth a wind was explained with Mushi :)

Does anyone know why the show is absent every other week?

The first time it was absent was because of the special episode that came the week after. The week after the special episode there was no new episode because they re-aired the special episode. From now on it should be back every week again.

That's good to hear. Why would they re-air the special though?

In any case, you asked relevant question, showing an attempt to pick up the pieces to the puzzle, and therefore should not be downvoted in my opinion, keep the discussion alive ^^
>> ARTICLE
He was just a kid who was all depressed about what he had done. That is why Ginko gave him that coming of age speech. 

From what I could tell the kid thought since he screwed up he might as well go all the way cause he is just a stupid failure anyway. You know, teenager crap. 
>> ARTICLE
You shouldn't be downvoted for your opinion.

I think people covered it more or less. You could tell he wanted the approval of his stepmother and she didn't give it to him. She was actually rather curt to him. Furthermore, given his father's reaction to his whistling in the morning, his father also wasn't very fatherly or warm---this could be attributed to feeling like his son from another marriage is almost a burden to his new life. (This might be a bit of a stretch since it's intentionally  ambiguous.)

In any case, the idea of the episode is that he realized his home wasn't really his home anymore. He probably thought if he let his stepmother die by calling the eel mushi, he might get his old life back. When Ginko convinced him otherwise (interestingly, appealing not to the guy's humanity or compassion  but rather his understanding of the mushi), he let the family be happy without him and set sail by himself.
>> ARTICLE
He probably grew up in a broken home, without his real mother. Perhaps his stepmother treated him poorly, we can definitely suspect that they have some tension between them, sadly it wasn't really elaborated much upon in this episode. His father also wanted him to stop whistling because his stepmother was sick, which could be seen as his father prioritizing her needs over his. I am pulling at straws here, since the episode didn't choose to focus on this ^^ But I hope my viewpoint helps you.
>> ARTICLE
A pretty underwhelming episode for Mushishi standards, however still very enjoyable. Interesting that this episode shares some of the theme with the previous one to some extent, both having people dealing with having powers. I wish they gave the sailor boy more backstory or something, without it he just came off like a selfish asshole. The Torikaze scene at the end was pretty nice. [Here's a .web of it.

I always loved how they do character design for kids. I always find them adorable :D

That ending was really beautiful and sad. In the end, she was too kind to step on anyone's shadow. The way these stories end is always just awesome and perfect. It just makes me sigh when it ends.
>> ARTICLE
They are great, but I find most of the character designs are very similar, to the point where I'm thinking this looks just like the guy in another episode.

There's been at least one incident when I got confused in the same episode too, which is bad I think. For this episode it was pretty close considering you don't really get a side by side comparison.
>> ARTICLE
And the fact, that they use actual child voice actors to voice children... It ruined me forever and now grown up women doing those fake children voices sound really creepy to me :/

I disagree with everyone saying this was a comparatively worse episode than previous episodes of this season. This is the first episode to make me genuinely cry at the end. Akane's second chance at life constrasting with her inability to step on another's shadow was so heartbreakingly beautiful.

ever since mushishi season 1 ended, the sequels haven't had the same impact on me; however, this episode really brought back those same feelings and emotions. 

this episode was simply beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Me too! Some episodes have almost made me cry but this one was the first to fully succeed. Where most shows need many episodes of build up to bring out that kind of emotion, mushishi apparently only needs 20 minutes. This episode reminded me why we I love mushishi.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, yes! I just finished watching this episode and I think it may be one of my favorites ever!

My God, this anime is really a fountain of beautiful stories.
>> ARTICLE
Another amazing episode. This last cour is shaping up to be the best of the series. This anime is unparalleled in terms of intertwining human drama and speculative fiction elements. The only ones that come close are Natsume and Mononoke. 

My only criticism of the series is it relies too much on flashbacks to set up the story and characters. It can feel a bit formulaic at times, but the stories are so good that I barely even mind it.

> the series is it relies too much on flashbacks to set up the story and characters

Unfortunately, this is the major problem with series that do stories one episode at a time. You kind of have to use flashbacks to set up the characters or else a lot of precious episode time will be wasted.

Not that I mind the execution in Mushishi though. The show handles it very well and makes the stories so good that the use of flashbacks is alright. Also, the show's direction somehow manages to get the transitions in-and-out of the flashbacks to be very smooth and of sense.
>> ARTICLE
i appreciate you from doing thsi cinematography.. i have been checking them out every episode. short but well done
>> ARTICLE
I get what you are saying with the flashbacks, but I honestly don't think its an issue. This show, with a main character (Ginko) as detached from the plot of each episode (kinda like a spectator), I think it kinda gives the creators license to use those flashbacks. 

Regardless of whether its an issue or not, the show still is brilliant.   
>> ARTICLE
She spent over 70 years lost because she was too kind to step on anyone else's shadow, even the old man that married the one that stole her life.  Jesus.

The highest level form of NTR.

Mushishi is the only show that consistently has very sad and beautiful episodes without it relying on corny cliches. Kudos to the writers.

Mushishi is based on a manga, so it's just one writer.
>> ARTICLE
I think Mushishi might be the first show where I've been upset that they skipped the OP.

Edit: Fuck me the beginning hit me really hard, this is the second time in a row Mushishi's made me tear up. 

Mikage wanting to go home reminded me of when my grandfather was in the late stages of dementia and would insist he needed to go to his home in Chile even though he hadn't lived there for decades...and now it's getting a bit hard to type through the tears.
>> ARTICLE
you are not the only one tearing up m8.. 
>> ARTICLE
Hearing Youkichi and his wife bicker reminds me so much of my grandparents and to some extent my own parents. This weeks episode, I thought, was more impactful than last weeks.
>> ARTICLE
I had a huge lump in my throat at the end there. There's never any happy-ever-afters in Mushishi. Nature doesn't allow for happy-ever-afters.

I like how this show constantly makes you place yourself in other people's shoes so effectively. When Akane's voice is talking about what the other world she found herself in is like, I really got a sense of the slow everlasting dread she must've felt. Was time the same for her? Did she spend 60, 70, 80 years wandering around in a lonely world of constant dusk? That was a little hard to swallow.
>> ARTICLE
the use of music in this anime.... holly fuck.. at the end when he apologizes to the shadow along with that beautiful tone playing in the background... too surreal
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is an amazing show. It's one of those shows perfect for watching before you go to bed - every episode is a self-contained story that manages to do in 20 minutes what many shows don't manage over several seasons. Some of the episodes are heartwarming, some of them are scary, some of them are sad, but they always manage to evoke emotions in me, and they are unusually relaxing... After watching them I can't help but think about the episode, about life, the universe, and everything.

This episode is a perfect example of that - the ending was perfectly bittersweet, I sat there looking at the credits for quite some time with a knot in my throat, just *thinking*. That poor Akane, too sweet to even step on the shadow of the man who married the girl who stole your own life.

Mushishi, never change.

Still no OP. Goddammit... 

At least, we're having great episodes.

I don't remember the first cour being really dark or anything, but man... The first two episodes of the second have been kinda dark/bittersweet so far... I love that, but it's kinda hard to bear.

Seeing Mikage realize what she had done and Akane not being able to steal away someone's life because she's too kind was heartbreaking...

I'm glad for Youkichi that Mikage was not the total opposite of Akane, personnality wise (kinda like Kuro/Illya...)

Also, goddammit was their fight when they were kid cute!

What a tearjerker episode. She probably followed Mikage for 70 years since she doesn't know what the right choice is. I guess it's Grandpa's turn to be the shadow, but I think there's a way around this.

1.) Find someone who's on their death bed.

2.) Step on their shadow

3.) ????

4.) Profit.

You don't age in the shadow, so that would just cause someone to have a really confusing death.

First I was creeped out by the mushi thinking its was just acting like a wormhole, a minor shenanigans in mushishi world to me but then we learned that it actually keep the person inside itself. I cant imagine what will happen if Akane remembers back, was it an accident the guy stepped on her shadow or he did it willingly? Man...
>> ARTICLE
Have to say this week's episode might not have been as strong as last weeks, but still pretty good. I will say, however, the comedy was pretty great today, we had a lot of great small moments that got some genuine laughs out of me. 

The whole "mushi reappearing after Ginko reveals what it is" mechanic was used again this week, and probably lost some of it's impact due the repetition. I also feel like the old man's character's motivation was a bit weak, and it was hard to tell weather he loved Akane before, or if he had gotten over it. It may have helped a bit to make us sympathize with her a little more, to show us  either some more of her life before the switch or some more of the effects of her disappearance. 

Looking forward to next week's episode, "hidden cove"

I'm not sure what you're getting at with your observation that mushi (or its effects) manifest itself after it's revealed by Ginko, but Akane appeared several years after Ginko's departure. There was genuine purpose behind Akane visiting Mikage's grave at the end of the episode, it's not just an arbitrary decision by the writer.
>> ARTICLE
I did not think of the mushi (Akane) reappearing at the end to mean that she was visiting Mikage's grave, that is an interesting point. 

I wouldn't say that it was an arbitrary decision by the writer, I was just drawing parallels between this and last weeks episode. In both cases Ginko only dropped by for a day or so, and rather than directly solving it he merely explained the phenomenon surrounding the mushi before leaving. In both stories, after an indiscriminate amount of time the mushi would appear and, rather than Ginko take care of it, the people would choose how to deal with it on their own terms.

 I am just pointing out that to me the two episodes had fairly similar plot structures, and I believe that may be the reason why it was less impactful than last week's episode
>> ARTICLE
Ok, I understand what you mean now. It's true that the past two episodes Ginko was only used as an expository character, rather than a main character.

My counter-point would be this: It was never less impactful when Ginko consistently directly solved problems and mysteries caused by mushi. I don't see why it therefore would be less impactful for Ginko to only indirectly play a part in the story for a few episodes.

I think it's less of it being objectively less impactful and more of it just not being your cup of tea. You like seeing Ginko more involved in the story. That's totally fine, and I got that feeling a little in last week's episode too.
>> ARTICLE
No, that is not what I mean at all. I actually think Ginko's minimal interference in last week's episode improved the story, he didn't need to be there any longer than he was and the writer didn't make him be there any longer than it was. 

I am saying that in both this week's episode and last's, the characters of both stories face similar situations where Ginko's knowledge on mushi ends up being useful much later on. I don't think that Ginko being there or not affects the emotional impact of the stories, but rather the repetition of the pattern where the characters meet the mushi again without Ginko. This repetition in of itself is what I am saying affected the impact, not Ginko's presence or lack thereof. 

It would have been interesting to see these stories in the opposite order to see weather it had the same effect or not. 
>> ARTICLE
The real question is how the rest of the season is going to play out. Is it going to focus more in Ginko or continue what has been happening these past 2 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
My guess would be a mix of both. Zoku Shou as a whole has has a much smaller focus on Ginko, and a greater focus on how regular people deal with mushi. I would love to see some more of Ginko's past, or possibly some sort of character arc for him, but I doubt that will happen. All I can say is that these upcoming episodes have me incredibly excited.
>> ARTICLE
Nice episode! Personally I think it wasn't as impactful as the last week's episode but considering this is Mushishi we are talking about.. it's still a very awesome episode.

The background music was good, those moments when Ginko goes around curing old people's knees were funny, and that scene when he had to piggy-back Mikage were good too.

I wonder what will become of Youkichi? Will he be trapped in the "other world" forever unless he stepped on another person's shadow too? 
>> ARTICLE
He'll probably decide to stay trapped in the other world. He knows what happens and since he's old, he has nothing to lose by staying in the other world. By doing that, he also lets people live their lives peacefully without having to make a hard decision (stepping on someone else's shadow to live but being selfish or let others live their life but being trapped alone forever...).
>> ARTICLE
To build onto that, I would agree with your assumption that Youkichi won't step on another person's shadow but I think the reasoning behind his decision isn't a "nothing to lose" situation. In fact, he has everything to lose. You heard it through Akane's (or Mikage's? I couldn't really tell by the voice) words about how it felt to be stuck as a shadow. Forever stuck at dusk, representative of a sort of limbo, you'll pretty much wander around forever unless you choose to step on someone else's shadow. I believe Youkichi felt an immense amount of guilt (just as Mikage did) for living his life like he did after Ginko told him about the situation. He's going into it knowing the pain and the everlasting loneliness to come, but he's making a decision (not sure whether to call it selfless because of its immediate consequences or selfish because he went against Akane's wishes) to carry that weight.

Another beautiful, relatable episode from Mushishi. This final season is looking to be the strongest the show has to offer. 
>> ARTICLE
so should you be happy at the end or sad?  confused
>> ARTICLE
When is Mushishi anything but bittersweet?
>> ARTICLE
Very interesting episode. Had a somewhat similar structure to last weeks, but had a totally different feeling compared to most of the episodes in this series. An atmosphere of gentle isolation? Of warming loneliness, or a kind of calming resignation? I don't know, but this show nails it's unsettling atmosphere and manages to intertwine it with so much more. All built on a very human situation of finding out your own happiness was built on another's loss of their own, with a very human reaction based on no ill will.
>> ARTICLE
You couldn't find a better series to bet on as Halloween-appropriate. Disappearing people being replaced by others living as shadows connecting through from other worlds is just perfect.

This episode was just pouring on the atmosphere. I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like this episode has the least amount of music this season. Silence like that allows the voice actors' performances to really pop through and create awesome scenes where the audience is listening in on a real conversation, just wondering where it's going. It makes the audience connect with the characters much more naturally than when music is guiding that process through.

This season, for me, surpasses the first in every way but the fantastical imagery (which isn't a problem since most of the themes of this season don't lend themselves to that as much as the first season's exploration of the Mushi did) It's going down as a definite recommendation for anyone who wants a series that takes them on a journey.
>> ARTICLE
Good episode, and like everyone else has said not as good compared to last weeks. Regardless, it seems they packed onions with this episode. Luckly was not as bad as last weeks, almost dehydrated me. 

The ending was a tad bit too rushed, could have delved into the shadows (Akanes) backstory a bit more and what it was doing all those years, but whats done is done.


>> ARTICLE
Ha! I finally found a flaw in Mushishi's writing!

Why did the old man believe Ginko about that shadow switching immediately? If he had expressed at least some doubt, it'd be more believable.
>> ARTICLE
Not really a flaw , Mushi-shi seemed to be as respected as doctors in this universe. So if a Mushi-shi says something is the way it is , than you usually won't get any naysayers in the show.
>> ARTICLE
There are plenty of episodes (or chapters) where people doubt Ginko. It usually ends in a disaster, but nevertheless.
>> ARTICLE
Didnt the old man mentioned that there was a mushi shi in the village some time ago? In my oppinion the trust in which the old man places  in Ginko comes from the insurance that mushi shis actually makes a difference and solves mysteries or the unknown/unseen. So its only natural to believe Ginko.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention that Ginko had helped his knee, though it could've easily been a placebo effect until the following morning. 
>> ARTICLE
And the award for the most badass mountain lord goes to the turtle.

Man, I am amazed at how easily mushishi surprises us every week.
>> ARTICLE
It's been so long since I seen season 1 (which is when I assume this was brought up) can you please remind me wtf a mounain lord is? Did it have something to do with that episode Ginko meets the old mushishi on the mountain who can't leave or something? I really need to rewatch season 1 some time.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, the Giant snake on the episode you mentioned became the mountain lord.

Even I don't remember much of the details, but they are basically kings of the mountains and maintain/balance the energy level and flow of kouki.
>> ARTICLE
That episode was really enjoyable. The mountain lord just looks so smug at the end knowing he conned Ginko out of his Kouki. I can't wait for the next season
>> ARTICLE
Is there a next season? I can't find any information regarding season 3.
>> ARTICLE
They're going to continue it in the fall of this year. Here's the [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24701/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_2nd_Season) . They're also doing some special episodes which are gonna air in November this year, [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24687/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_Specials)
>> ARTICLE
Possibly one of my most-loved episodes yet (and that's really saying something, considering we're talking about Mushishi here). Somehow I just really rather appreciated the tranquil peacefulness this particular story expressed. And seeing the pure vulnerability of Ginko in such a solitary location was really rather lovely too.

I swear Mushishi has become a legitimate form of meditation for me
>> ARTICLE
Only Mushishi can pull off such an amazing, yet quiet episode like this and make it look easy. I'm gonna miss this show next season, but at least we have another confirmed season to look forward to.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! Very low-key yet very satisfying. Beautiful as well.
>> ARTICLE
I thought this might be Mushishi's version of a nature documentary but instead it's just Ginko getting swindled lol. I loved the folklore vibe of the whole episode.

Also Ginko walking around in circles reminded of episode 14, when he got lost in the bamboo forest. That episode was really sad.
>> ARTICLE
I was kind of hoping that when he got out of the pond, he'd end up discovering that he had slept for hundreds of years to end up in modern day Japan.
>> ARTICLE
I hope it doesnt take them another 9 years to come out with a new season
>> ARTICLE
Last 2 episodes of this season will come out on BD only. (Which will undoubtedly get fansubbed) Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd season is set to air this fall.
>> ARTICLE
thats good news =) thx
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic end to a fantastic season. The whole feel of this show is in a tier of its own, for me at least. The peaceful tranquility of the setting combined with the thoughtful methods of dealing with mushi that Ginko uses just puts me in a great mood whenever Im watching.

Honestly, watching Mushishi is like the visual form of listening to Arve Henriksen. Just pure bliss.
>> ARTICLE
I misheard some news and thought that this was the last episode, so I legitimately thought Ginko was going to die due to that one line that seemed a bit too much like foreshadowing: "Weaker animals might not survive. It's a gamble." I barely restrained from freaking the fuck out when he went under. 

Either way, what an atmospheric episode that was. Really quiet and desolate. Probably my favorite episode of both seasons. Watching Ginko wander around and not know what to do was really refreshing after seeing him have the solution to every other problem. Really pretty scenery (especially that snow mmm) and nice expressions and motions from our favorite mushishi. The wait for the second half will be agony.

What a cheeky little fella

>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed this Ginko centric episode, the ambiance in this episode was absolutely captivating.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoy episodes with Ginko alone more than when it's focussed on other people.

I thought this episode was great and I can't wait for the specials and the next season.
>> ARTICLE
Best episode of the season for sure.

Although the others were good, this felt more like the first season. I enjoy the time with Ginko more than the interactions of mushi with regular people.

The scenery was particularly well done.
>> ARTICLE
Incredible episode, and also the first (I believe) where the only person in the episode is Ginko himself. It dramatically changed the focus of the show from how mushi affect people to how mushi affects nature itself. Easily one of my favorite episodes this season. 
>> ARTICLE
FUCKING THIEVING TURTLE

On another note, why do the mushi seem attracted to Ginko so much, that he has to smoke weed every day? Other mushishi doesn't seem to suffer the same fate. Is it because he smells/feels like kouki, from the incident in his childhood where he got infected with Tokoyami?
>> ARTICLE
Dunno about the smell/feel but it's definitely because of that incident.
>> ARTICLE
That's just my theory, but mushi are extremely simple organisms. They feed on different things, but what lures them pretty much all the time is kouki in fluid form, so in my opinion the only explanation why Ginko attracts various mushi is because of that. It's not as strong as raw kouki, because it would royally screw his job, but it's strong enough to make mushi gather around him.  
Fuck, why didn't Urushibara write more backstory for Ginko? He's a brilliant character! I'll just post [my favourite scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7saaCvHX6Y#t=983). The "Come out, mushi" gives me shivers.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain this to me: 

The manga for Mushishi is godly. The Mushishi anime is amazing. Mushishi Zoku Shou is also amazing. Mushishi in general is revered and loved by almost all. 

The second part of basically one of the highest quality anime in the last few years, which doesn't comply to a number of tropes that everyone complains about, is currently airing.

But barely anyone in this sub seems to care one bit. The episode threads get tens of comments. It's been an hour since the episode went up and not a single comment. Why is that? I guess /r/anime has shit taste, kappa.

Honestly, it's very frustrating reading so many threads where people are cynical about the current state of anime. Everyone still watches bullshit like SAO, but ignores the high quality stuff that deserves support.  edit. Let's be clear I watch SAO too, lol.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll definitely streams Mushishi, both America and Europe so I doubt that's it.
>> ARTICLE
because people here on this subreddit cant enjoy an anime with beautiful art, music, plot they need overpowered brainless mc's with a 10 girls harem and some quality panty shots go better to mal they enjoy this anime more and the discussion there is better

>> ARTICLE
Dear god this has probably been the most condescending comment thread I've seen in a while. Please refrain from pushing your opinion as absolute while simultaneously bashing on this imagined, mindless fanbase you have in your mind. 

I agree that Mushishi is an excellent anime (one of my favorites) and it deserves more discussion, but at the same time, this doesn't call for starting a rant about "superior" tastes in entertainment. Let people enjoy what they want to watch, and please keep the discussion to the episode's contents. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, this might just be me but I'm saying it anyways. I love the anime, but I'm only 5 episodes in after watching it for like two months because something about watching it is just way too relaxing. 

That's a good thing, and I watch it especially when it's hard for me to sleep, but it's really bad to marathon like you can with most anime. I caught up with Psycho-Pass to watch P-P 2 in like a week, but I just can't do that with Mushi-shi, or I'll fall asleep.

It's the only reason I'm not on these threads, I just happened to look in this one to see how it was going. 
>> ARTICLE
People judges a book by its cover and Mushishi doesn't really ignite that interest on a quick glance unlike SAO. I mean, I've heard about how good Mushishi is for a long time but didn't pick it up until recently. Instead, I watched those high-profile shows like Aldnoah, Nozaki-kun, Attack on Titan etc.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe a lot of people haven't seen Mushishi and don't know this is an episodic anime so they think they can't watch it because they haven't seen season 1.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is Mushishi isn't a type of anime for everybody. It requires a special taste of things, I think. And it's not that much debatable since there's no big plot into it. And I'm not pointing it as a flaw. It's just different. I'm recently new to this subthread although I watch Mushishi for a long time now. I just feel good about watching it, I feel the need to make other people watch it but I don't feel the need to discuss it, you know what I'm saying?
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is more like a cult classic than a mainstream hit. It's one of the reasons why 'everyone seems to love it' but yet it sits as a S.A.V.E. title on [Funimation](http://shop.funimation.com/Shop/ShopProductDetail.ss?itemid=47044).

The only reason it's getting any NE love is b/c Aniplex is releasing BD's at some point. But we don't know if they'll dub it (doubt it tho)
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, there's not a lot to actually discuss in a Mushishi 'discussion' because the show pretty much lays it out on the episode. As they say, the work speaks for itself.

Say what people will about other anime, but they are a lot easier to comment on because they often leave a lot of plot threads hanging (sometimes on purpose, sometimes not) and there's a lot more drama within the premise of the story, characters and the fandom.

It's really not a knock on other anime or Mushishi. It's just how it is.
>> ARTICLE
No clue, I love the single story per episode format it does and still keeping a certain thread across all the stories.

Guess its not for everyones pleasure :\

Edit:

Though this does give one big advantage. I can browse peoples anime lists and find hidden gems that I'm sure I will like. Going though Denzoos list (pretty big anime compatilibly @ 84%) and cherry picking what I have not seen yet :)
>> ARTICLE
I rather like the fact that Mushishi threads don't devolve into what other anime's do - waifu wars, source-adaptation comparison, inane drivel, fawning over certain characters, "X best Y" bullshit, borderline retards quarrelling, gif/screenshot/quote dumps (Hey, we watched *the same fucking episode?!* Holy fuck, what are the fucking odds!), and other mindless bullshit.

Mushishi threads are like its episodes - quiet, mellow, and pleasant.
>> ARTICLE
I never comment on these threads, but I have seen every episode. Mushishi is the kind of anime that is hard to craft a middling response to. Its so enveloped in themes and messages that it takes some actual analyzing to say anything moderately useful on the subject. 

"I liked it, it made me cry/laugh/happy/sad" is not an interesting comment to write, nor is it interesting to read.


I imagine a lot of people watch this, but just don't comment on it.
>> ARTICLE
I agree completely that it's a show that doesn't elicit much interesting response (not like that stops most people in other threads,) but look at the ratings on CR - only 57 ratings for the most recent Mushishi episode, and 357 for the most recent SAO episode. I don't think a lot of people are watching Mushishi at all. It's also very unfair to compare it to one of the most popular anime of recent years, but hopefully you get my point.

I'm sorry for my generally whiny comment on the state of the anime fandom, but where better to express my discontent than the void of reddit.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think a show like Mushishi would be immensely popular in any medium. Mushishi, despite its strengths is not a fun show to watch. That goes doubly so for people like myself that like an overarching plot in my shows. 

I'll be honest. If I were to tell you that I look forward to this show every week, I would be lying. even further, I can't even say that I really enjoy the show all that much, but I wind up rating it high anyways because that was kind of the point of the show. 

Its a show that seems tailored to analysis, which is not going to be your casual anime fan.

>> ARTICLE
I think a major contributing factor in the lack of attention surrounding Mushishi is essentially the manga dates back to 1999, and the first series aired in 2005. With the subreddit every expanding the majority of users now are getting into the hobby through recent series like Shingeki, things that started a decade and beyond ago are out of their scope at the moment most likely. Very little ever touches the front page outside of the flavour of the month mainstream references that garner easy upvotes, that's not much of a help either.

You need to have watched 2 series/2 specials dedicated to Mushishi to be watching this at the moment, and the highly episodic nature of the series means that there's very little opportunity to theorise what's going to happen next or make comment on certain happenings(which is the sum of most discussion threads.) Because each and every episode has a beginning middle and end and no doubt leaves most people satisfied with nothing to say on the matter unless they feel like deconstructing the episode.
>> ARTICLE
We had a [survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2lwkda/midseason_comprehensive_fall_2014_anime_survey/) a few days ago. Out of 3209 people 341 said that they are currently watching Mushishi Zoku Shou 2.

That is still not even close to what it deserves, but 11% is a decent amount if you consider the kind of show that it is. 

Most casual anime fans prefer action or comedy shows so looking at the popularity on sites like CR or MAL isn't really fair.

/u/Advenna64 will make a detailed post about the survey results soon, so if you are interested in seeing what people on /r/anime watch and enjoy then keep an eye on him.
>> ARTICLE
I completely forgot about that survey, despite participating in it! I look forward to the more in depth analysis!

How dare you insinuate that MAL or CR are for casuals. I'll have you know that I have over 300 confirmed animes on my list.

Also, please keep spreading the love for Chihayafuru. That third season's not going to happen, but I sure hope if I say it enough on the internet it will.

I love mushishi but I never comment on these because I don't feel like I have much to contribute.

How? he cannot see Mushishi

Yeah, he'll probably have a fake shiny one made and then sell it to him.
>> ARTICLE
Doubt it because i don't think he could get fake shiny kimono since the glow is from mushi. If he does get a fake one that shiny without the help of mushi then its hella expensive which i don't think he can afford or willing to pay. 

Edit: well this is just from a guy who knows nothing about kimono and shiny stuff
>> ARTICLE
> How? he cannot see Mushishi

"Ginko? Where are you?!"
>> ARTICLE
I liked this one a hell of a lot more than the last two. Ginko was a more active participant this time, that's a plus. I also liked this episode's characters more, they had clearer motivations and personalities. Felt really nice to see Gen happy at the end.  
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is like a fine wine, it only improves with age.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me, or has it been a long time since we've met people who deny the possibility of the existence of mushi? The first season had a lot of that, while the second seemed like people are starting to accept the fact. I guess this episode felt a bit refreshing in a sense?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe after all the phenomenon that has happened, people slowly learned to accept it. Although, I don't think Mushishi is linear at all. But rumours spread and whatnot. Maybe it depends on the location, some villages may be more inclined to superstitious beliefs more than others. Especially those which actually have designated town mushishis.
>> ARTICLE
When the father said 'Gen, I'm sorry...' i almost thought he was gonna say his mother had died in the years he hadn't seen her.

Thank god that wasn't the case. Very nice episode again.

I think mushishi has a mostly seinen audience, SOA is shounen/sienen so it has twice the potential audience

SAO is about as pure a shonen show as you could come up with. It's not aimed at adult men at all, though of course there's some splashover regardless.

Great ending, one of the "feel good" ending in mushishi to me. Others are somewhat depressing or bittersweet for me.I cant help but to grin and say "Fuck you mushi, not in this episode".

[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, it was a beautiful episode, it's nice to see a happy ending in Mushishi every now and then.
>> ARTICLE
So am i right in thinking that the ending implied that he used the mushi purge, or did i misinterpret.

>> ARTICLE
Nah, man. He decided to use that which took life (the mushi) to grow life (his family).
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he used it, rather it shows he's willing to take breaks and eats food now to control the mushi.
>> ARTICLE
It's left a little ambiguous, but I think he took the medicine a few years later.

The snow comes back to the mountain and the fields are mostly bare. Instead of the lush grains the mushi provided, they are scraping by with a few hardy radishes. What's more, you're given the impression that this is a full-family job instead of a 1-man operation before. The comment about being hungry is another clue that he is feeling the normal side effects of hard work.

I think the happy ending was intended to send a message that it wasn't the mushi that made them a happy family, it was each other. Even with it gone, even with the harsh conditions around them, they still laugh and have fun.
>> ARTICLE
> they are scraping by with a few hardy radishes

I don't think they were "scraping by". It looked to me they were just normally harvesting winter or Rabi crops.
>> ARTICLE
You've the hit all the points that make me think that he did take the medicine in the end, also i thought a happy ending would make more sense if he took the medicine since the mushi would have him die from exhaustion and then later target a new victim, the episode hinted that this is not that far way for him, since he collapsed from exhaustion earlier in the episode.
>> ARTICLE
You can't go wrong with an episode of Mushishi every Friday. Once again this week's episode was amazingly beautiful and relaxing, even more because it had a happy ending. Also the ending song was one of the best so far IMHO.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of wintery episodes this season/half of the manga. Maybe that's why the opening is called shiver.
>> ARTICLE
So, the mushi turned her blood into breastmilk.

>> ARTICLE
While I was watching, I noticed the episode from the first season, "'Here Comes The Rain, Here Comes The Rainbow" parallels this one at some points. Probably because both mushi are nagaremono, but there's also the rain motif. Coincidently, they both share episode 7 of their respective seasons.

I made a [gifset](http://weleaveshadows.tumblr.com/post/86644338926/it-should-rain-soon) a few minutes ago comparing them.
>> ARTICLE
Man this episode really hit me... First off quotes:

"Water that soaks not into the earth, but instead creeps along its surface is false. You may pursue it, but you can never reach it."

"If anyone could, they would no longer be human." 

"I want to howl and cry, but I can't even shed a tear."

"All I know is that I have no home to go back to, nor place I can make my home. And I don't even have tears I can shed to accept that fact."

"We call such mushi drifters. They wander without a purpose."

"Once the rain stops and real tears can be shed... I will put down roots. Until then with the rain by my side, I will continue to drift like the clouds."

She is unable to deal with her pain and grief. She doesn't even consider herself human; because even babies can cry. She isolates herself from others, because she fears what sharing her pain could do. She speaks very simply and directly. She stays long enough to provide some benefit and then leaves before attaching herself to anyone. Always feeling the weight of the pain she can't get over, carrying that burden and unwilling to let anyone help... Man, Teru reminds me way too much of myself.
>> ARTICLE
It seems like you're carrying a burden. Do you want to talk about it? I'd really appreciate it if you'd PM me.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked that the girl's name was Teru, when the Teru Teru Bozous are those ghost-like thingies people hang on the windows to stop rain.
>> ARTICLE
Bit late to the party here, but they do this all the time.

I remember in the first season, there was one kid named Miharu who could "see spring" during Winter. "Mi" means "see" and "haru" is "spring" haha
>> ARTICLE
...
Such geniuses behind this anime.
>> ARTICLE
I love the use of rain as an analogue for her tears. The parallel between the drifter mushi and Teru's life was also an elegant analogy. Mushishi really excels at these type of things.

There's some awkward editing in this episode though. The way the flashbacks were done was a bit jarring.
>> ARTICLE
I really like this episode. Especially the theme of balance is in my oppinion a great deal in mushishi. The rain in which represent life can be a blessing or a curse if you got too little or too much of it. 
The mushi are are neutral beings that just exist. But human can be both and because of in they can disturbe the balance. I won't say Teru is bad or somekind but since she is human she disturbe the balance with her presence even though the mushishi is the cause. 
So the quote she statted in this episode,"If anyone could, they would no longer be human." was very accurate and somehow sad. Since she must chance her life of being human to a life of being mushi(drifter).
>> ARTICLE
Such a bittersweet episode
>> ARTICLE
Good episode, though I'm not sure what was supposed to be "special" about it, like the ending of episode 6 said.

Also, I'm noticing a bit of a recurring theme here. Tragic event happens to the MC of the episode in the past. Tragic event affects how MC acts. Later, the same event seemingly repeats itself, but it turns out not to be as tragic as the first time. This repetition (along with Ginko) helps the MC understand what the phenomenon is and how to live with it. Happened with the red tide in episode 2, happened with the icy lake in episode 3, and happened again now. Might be more as well, but I don't recall off the top of my head. Makes for a well-rounded story, but I do wish there was a bit more variety.

I think the significance of this episode though, is perspective. She initially sees the rain as a curse, and over time she does start to enjoy the reactions of the people when they see her. But there's always a barrier between her and acceptance. Until she meets Ginko. Once he explains it, he quickly changes her perspective and sees the rain as more of a blessing. Bringing water to people that need it. She even sees hope for herself, planning to set down roots when it's over.

Point is, yeah there's some similarities there, but this one stands out to me. I liked it. Good to be back. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this episode. But it felt a bit "safe" if you know what I mean? I liked last episode a lot, and that felt a bit different than most of the other episodes. It felt pretty original and interesting, especially with how the conflict was resolved. The climax of that episode was pretty exceptionally thrilling for a mushishi episode. If there was more stuff like that, I'd fall in love with this series even more. (I know this kind of goes against my originality comment, but the point is I'd like stuff with a more dramatic climax)

This is still my favorite show of the season, though. Each episode has been really good.
>> ARTICLE
The special episode was last week, it was a some live talk with the creators.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, okay. That makes sense, then.
>> ARTICLE
1. "The water flowing on the water, running away as you chase it is fake" - talking of illusions, which come when you want water the most.

1. "If anyone could make it rain, they would no longer be human." - Which is why she doesn't settle. I wouldn't be surprised if she takes the rain with her, so she must travel around, so every place would get rain, or wouldn't get too much.

1. They're blaming Teru for the lack of rain, but she never told them she will make the rain come, only that she *predicts* it, so why blame her? They blame her because she had given them *hope*. And more than that, they *beseech* her - they have no one else to turn to, so they turn on to her, and on her, in their frustration.

1. Once someone close to her died because of the rain she brought, and once due to her failure to bring rain. Cruel fate.

1. The mushi are "Drifters", wandering without purpose. Having taken them in, Teru must also take their life, to wander around without purpose. She had to shed her humanity along with her tears, and become a Mushi-like existence.

Man, what a beautiful episode it'd been. "Once the rain stops, I will put down roots", when they can no longer be washed away by the endless rain. Also, Ginko is right - even if there are beings *responsible*, it doesn't mean they are to *blame*.

>> ARTICLE
I really liked this ep, moreso than some of the other stories in S2. The problem with Mushishi is that sometimes it is either too blatantly allegorical, or it is structured too much as a high-concept fairytale that it can be really hard to understand.

This episode got the balance just right, like some of the better stories from the series. They don't spell out the metaphor like you're an idiot, but rather ground it in something very relatable (the fickleness of rain clouds and the inability to settle down) where we're free to draw our own conclusions. The metaphor is subtly reinforced throughout the show, and the ending is satisfyingly free of simplistic pat moralizing.

Tl;dr- 10/10 good episode, plz more of this Mushishi.
>> ARTICLE
Is it me or did today's episode have an incredible use of sound?  Especially the silence.
>> ARTICLE
Very few TV anime directors make a good use of silence in their shows. 

Anime has a bad habit of being too loud.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. And it makes sense - snow deadens sound significantly, so silence is greatly appropriate. It also fit the sadder tone of this one.
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing I hate more than shows that over blow their drama with screaming and an overbearing sound track.  The moment when Tae fell into the river was nothing but silence and a quick progression of stills, yet it felt like my heart was being torn apart.  That's some quality direction there.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, did you watch the first season of *Silver Spoon*? There was a great silent scene in episode 4 involving [](/s "Hachiken coming to terms with slaughtering a deer.") That was one of the best scenes of Summer 2013 IMO.
>> ARTICLE
I have not.  I'll add it to my backlog.
>> ARTICLE
Some pretty strong feels this episode. My heart sank a bit when Tae fell through the ice, but I'm glad that she didn't end up like Toki's sister. Although I didn't feel this episode was as visually impressive as last week, I still can't get over how calming this show's atmosphere is. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
You could feel the atmosphere in this one. I heard that the 2nd season is going to be taking a darker tone than the first and you could definitely tell here. That depression and hopelessness after a loved one dies, I know that feeling. 

There was some wonderful wallpaper material, especially with the falling snow on the bottom of the lake holy crap.
>> ARTICLE
>I heard that the 2nd season is going to be taking a darker tone than the first 

If what you're saying is true, that sheds a whole new light on the OP. S1's opening was Ally Kerr's "The Sore Feet Song", and while it was certainly a little melancholic, the lyrics were pretty positive and seemed to indicate the singer was going towards someone they loved.

But then look at the video for [Lucy Rose's "Shiver"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o84y-5-cO0) - it's very clearly about remembering something (or someone) that's long past; it's not just melancholic - it's downright depressing. I can only imagine what's going to come next for us, and I'm actually a little scared what could happen. I would love it if we finally got an emotional arc for Ginko, though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Ginko has to be the most empty MC ever. I mean the whole show is driven by Mushi and not him so it is okay but it would be interesting if  we had more than just those two flashback episodes about his past. And that music video is really depressing, I got kind of a Ginko vibe from the old man too.
>> ARTICLE
I know it's only 3 episodes in but there haven't been any bad endings yet, so far theres nothing any more dark than the first season which also had dealt with death and depression and had death as a recurring theme. I thinking of the goo babies episode in particular that was pretty fucked up. I'm not saying your wrong, I just don't get that feeling from these episodes alone. 
>> ARTICLE
How was he able to breathe at the bottom of the lake for so long? Did the cold slow down his bodily functions to the point where he just didn't need to? Or is this just one of those questions you're not supposed to ask?
>> ARTICLE
I think Toki was in the process of becoming a mushi, like Hinata from the OVA- that's why he didn't need the usual requirements to survive. The mushi were keeping him alive, but they weren't really protecting him either. What I don't get is why he gets up on his own and returns to the village. In all the other cases of people turning into mushi, someone has to come and snap the person out of it. Toki does this on his own, even though he has no reason to do so- he even likes it at the bottom of the lake. This is also where he thinks his sister is.

A minor inconsistency.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't Toki say that there was a blanket of snow that didn't melt at the bottom of the lake, and that he fell asleep under it?
>> ARTICLE
This episode was a lot stronger on the "Mushi as metaphor" theme, so I'd just not think too hard about the practicalities and instead focus on the other stuff the story was saying (depression following the death of his sister).
>> ARTICLE
And it was a lovely metaphor at that, he literally became cold an analogy for loss of emotion after this sister's death, and he regained the sense of heat (emotion) by the warmth of the human heart. 
>> ARTICLE
mushi. The answer to everything in this show.

I'm glad I marathoned the first season.

This show is just so fucking good. And that's without looking into the symbolism and such.

And I just noticed. The first episodes dealt with people drinking kouki, the basic life of mushi.

The start of life in the first episode or the start of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Classic Mushishi bitter-sweetness.

I love the metaphorical use of the cold and snow to express Toki's feeling of numbness after losing his sister. Then use Tae's warmth to express the feeling of caring and comfort that helped Toki to move on. Very simple but well executed.
>> ARTICLE
I just gotta say, Mushishi was one of my top 5 anime before I knew season 2 was coming and now this is like the best season of anime ever. We get Stardust Crusaders and Mushishi *in the same hour*. What a way to start weekend!

That's all I can come up with to say. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some burritos to eat and Startdust Crusaders to watch...
>> ARTICLE
I like the little details in this show. When Toki and Tae were walking to the lake, you could see Tae's breath. Toki was too cold for any vapour to form.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode. It was pretty dark, which I'm enjoying this season. Toki definitely had depression, which the snow was a metaphor for. It kept bringing him down, or falling on him. Toki in turn eventually hurt Tae, which depression can do to loved ones. Very understandable, sometimes it's very hard for someone who is depressed to get help even when others try to help them. It certainly is a struggle.  
>> ARTICLE
I teared up a little when Toki was carrying Tae through the snow. Still as good as ever, Mushishi. This show is kind of like a dream, or its own set of folk tales. It's such a surreal and haunting, yet relaxing experience.
>> ARTICLE
And when he appears before Ginko, the tears on his cheeks had frozen.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was just beautiful. Best episode so far of this sequel series.
>> ARTICLE
It's one of very few shows (Mushishi S1, Cromartie, Ghost Hunt) whose OP and ED I don't skip.
>> ARTICLE
Could have sworn I saw this episode before. When he walks in the snow barefoot with his monologue is really where I felt like I saw it before.
>> ARTICLE
It's snowing where I live, fitting.

Last week's was the usual masterpiece storytelling, but this one was a more predictable, straightforward and simple episode. The usually strong convincing pseudo-science took an obvious rest. The the same story about depression and how it hurts, not only yourself but others as well, could have been delivered in a more Mushishi-way... 

yeah... the whole day underwater magic was a bit too much for my immersion.
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting how Ginko can feel really intimidating sometimes, yet without any serious changes in his look, voice or attitude.
>> ARTICLE
Always gotta watch out for the quiet ones.
>> ARTICLE
That was a great episode. Had a dark atmosphere, but a relatively light resolution. I love how this show is able to constantly make up new mushi or mushi related phenomenon and have them all seem logical and believable. 
>> ARTICLE
> relatively light resolution

A guy gets his arm eaten by ravenous birds, narrowly escaping a fate worse than death wandering around a mountain for the rest of eternity. Yeah, light.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the episode was gonna end with his Dad hunting him down from the Mushi world :o
>> ARTICLE
I said relatively. Many episodes of Mushishi end with the person(s) Ginko is trying to save dying or having a fate arguably worse than death. This episode the guy merely lost an arm. Considering the dark tone of the episode, I would say this was a light ending.
>> ARTICLE
*And then* he lives happilys ever after, compared to the real bad ends this was very light

Many shows don't even tell half as good stories in 12 episodes as Mushishi does in 24 minutes. Bravo.

The moment with the crows attacking is seriously one of the freakiest things I have seen in a long time.

Imagine if this episode was played in cinema. I watched it with SVP on (forces 60FPS on a video, smoothing frames and doing magic shit that makes movies look ten times better), and that scene with crows had me shivering.

Oh god, that would wreck live action movies, and probably even most animations. Most Movies and Animations rely on their frame rate for the aesthetic they are going for. Almost the entire Movie industry is built around 24fps.

I love how they presented a man who hunts in a "wrong" way, but didn't outright say it's wrong to hunt in that way. They only showed the bad consequences of hunting in that manner. The stinking meat, the destructive attitude, and the eventual disappearance were all really poignant little environmental messages.

Wait a minute, these people have [*guns*? With ***laser sights***?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BmFRHRqCAAEOdDa.png)

Anyway, masterful use of silence (again!). They really captured the feeling of being alone in a forest at night - it's not the noise that freaks you out, it's the lack of it. Very good atmosphere as usual.

I was surprised when i saw that, i had to rewind to make sure it was a gun.

I believe it's a [tanegashima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanegashima_%28Japanese_matchlock%29), and red thing is... a fire?

So, just a burning [slow match](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_match). Thanks for the link, was confused as well for a moment there. I forgot that early guns used to be like that.

Looks like the red glow of a match used to spark the powder. 
>> ARTICLE
My God, did this episode look beautiful, or did it look beautiful?  The art's always been stunning but some of these scenery pieces, man. I'd love to get some of them framed.

This was a pretty dark episode.  It was incredibly unsettling too.  I'm always in awe at how well the show establishes its atmosphere and tones.  Great, great stuff here.
>> ARTICLE
There was quite a... sickly? atmosphere to that whole thing.

The gun caught me off guard, I was under the firm impression that this takes place before any technology of that kind became prevalent. Maybe it's that fairy tale style that makes it feel like everything is in some kind of microcosm, outside of time.

Guns have been around for a long time, even in Japan. Mushishi is set during the isolationist era so guns would be uncommon, but definitely not a new kind of technology since they were using them in warfare long before the isolationist policies began.

But... I don't think there are any hard rules for timelines here, after all Ginko wears some pretty modern shoes and snazzy turtlenecks. 

>> ARTICLE
He is dressed much more modern than many of the people he helps.
>> ARTICLE
The music while they were remembering the dad's death was awesome.  Mushi-shi always does such a good job setting the atmosphere.

He was damn lucky he only lost an arm by the end of the episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Great episode had a quite eerie atmosphere to it, almost felt like a horror episode. I can't say i remember any other episodes that had the same feel as this one.

>> ARTICLE
The moments where Ginko was being "hunted" were especially tense. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode gave me a "The Most Dangerous Game" vibe and a little bit of "The Birds" vibe towards the end. Good stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode, I wonder why the hunters didn't go search for tatsu-nii though.  Surely they must have realized it was a human after Ginko/younger bro ran up to them.

Also, I thought it was super cool that the [dad not having his shadow](http://imgur.com/XpeEhIT) actually looked different/slightly weird while still seeming natural; a testament to the artwork of the show, if you will.
>> ARTICLE
I think mushi-shi needs little more than 30min, it's a great episodic show, and sometimes the stories (like yesterday's) needs mode time.

To the the episode as always a great story, wonderful art. like everyone here the gun's scene caught me out off guard, it's not very mushishi-ish but it doesn't change much.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the gun doesn't seem very mushishi-ish because its a pretty violent moment, and those are few and far between in this series. Human violence is so rare that it makes those moments all the more effective and alarming.
>> ARTICLE
I loved this episode but I'm noticing a trend in this run which feels different from the first series. In that one it seemed like Ginko was trying to piece together a mystery with figuring out which mushi is causing the problem. He sometimes had a few false leads before figuring it out. It didn't happen exactly that way every episode but I remember there being a number which went like that. 

This season, he knows which mushi is causing the problem right off the bat and the onus is on the afflicted person to overcome their human nature or short-sightedness to remedy the situation. There was some of that there but it's even more so in this season and in many ways darker with melancholic resolutions.

I don't know if it's because of the stretch of chapters they're adapting have this particular tone or what. It's not bad in the least but it's an interesting twist on what I remember of the first run of episodes. Still bringing the tears each time too.  
>> ARTICLE
The birds flying in was one of the most foreboding sequences of the series. Easily.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty solide episode the scne with the gun was the most surprising but also pretty ironic if you take notes of what Ginko said to Tatsu before he depart to get the kouki.
 In my oppinion the power Tatsu gains from the fouki could be seen as arrogance of humanity itself. For instance he feared his father because of it but the moment he get the taste of power he changes. Becoming a mad man who think he rules the mountain. The fouki is being displayed as a metapher for power, which I find most intriguing if you think about it. 
One last thing i want to talk about is the meaning of the birds in this episode. Sure we can say that crows are an omen of death but if you take what Tatsu said himself about bird, which they are mainly lressent at daylight and they are weak. But how do Tatsu meet his dimise? 
Well these are my thoughts on this episode comment if you like and I am sorry for my bad english if there problem with it.
>> ARTICLE
Is there anyway I can get a picture of the ending but without the credits in the way
>> ARTICLE
I love Mushishi, but there is one problem i have with it. Ginko has next to no character progression. As an episodic style of show, having each episode as it's own little story, I would think Ginko would be shown to change slowly as the events unfold, episode by episode. Become more irritable, more distrustful of people, something to show that his life of constantly wandering and close work with mushi are getting to him in some way. But i can't see any of this occurring and think that the series focuses too much on each individual episodes characters, who we only see for a limited time, in comparison to Ginko, the main character who should be the most fleshed out.


>> ARTICLE
Ginko is merely the link between each story, he's not the focus. The author wanted to tell stories about mushi and the interactions people have with them that, like any natural thing, can be good, bad, and neutral, and Ginko exists to explain what's going on and assist these people, and to ultimately provide continuity between each separate story. That's all. Mushishi wouldn't be an award winning series if it dropped this formula in favour of focusing on a character arc for Ginko... who really doesn't need development either way. He's already incredible wise. If he suddenly turned misanthropic it would negate a lot of the intelligent and considered things he's said previously about people and mushi.


However, if you want more personal type episodes, there should be an episode (maybe even a two-parter) coming up that picks up with recurring characters.
>> ARTICLE
That's missing the point of the show a bit. As /r/Ashe_Black says, the main character isn't Ginko, but rather the world around him, he's merely the lens that it's being viewed through. 

And while Ginko doesn't seem to change, part of the idea is not that we see him evolve, but we learn what happened to make him the person that he is, when we first meet him. That involves learning about the world that he lives in, basically.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi isn't about Ginko, it's about the mushi and the people that Ginko meet. Similarly with Kino no Tabi.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that the mother does not miraculously gain feelings for her son  after she learns that he was only trying to protect everyone is what sets mushishi apart from other animes. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think one good incident will automatically make amends for their past history, but I wouldn't have minded if she started seeing him in a better light. Either way, they will have to learn to live with eachother and accept reality. It just shows that families can learn to improve as with any other kind of relationship.
>> ARTICLE
I can't really see that as a good incident.  She was trying to be a better mother by committing suicide through her son, not particularly caring about the likelihood he'd live through the fact scarred for life.  He pushes her away and denies her of her selfish wish.  She's not happy, he's not happy, no one is happy.

The whole point is that no matter what crazy thing happens, the mother cannot feel anything for her son.  Her son is even less than another person to her, just as her husband is.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with you there. Either way, the immediate disaster was averted. I think that's at least the good news.
>> ARTICLE
In the end didn't it say that the son went on to live with his relatives.
>> ARTICLE
I think the beauty of its ending is that the answer stays in the air. The son and mother got apart but she took an effort to find an umbilical cord and he holds it. Their relationship is not getting better but doesn't die. It exists like a weak, thin thread, or like a small, dried umbilical cord. No one knows where it goes. It's not black or white as a life is sometimes like that. 
>> ARTICLE
The closer we draw to the eventual completion of the manga's adaptation the more solemn a new episode feels. And that emotion carried through this episode in its exploration of this broken family unit.

I love how the mushi simply leaves of its own accord as an affirmation of the irreparable nature of Reki and Shino's relationship.

I love Reki's challenging stare as a demonstration of his frustration when Shino halfheartedly tried to call him back inside.

I love how Shino will only accept some form of escape as a means to reconcile with her son, coaxing *him* to relieve *her* of her misgivings first and foremost.

I love how Ginko has been referencing data from the archives lately. Every time he breaks out a scroll, I immediately beam with happiness at the thought of Tanyu's pen having graced it. I've always imagined Ginko's narration at the end of an episode as a conversation with her that gets committed to that written base of knowledge that Tanyu spearheads. At the moment she's almost another member of the audience, but one day in the far future they will set out together to live out those stories together.

I really don't want this series to end, guys.
>> ARTICLE
wish i could be immersed in such a great series as yourself

perhaps its the superficial lack of overarching plot to pair with the immense development, but mushishi just doesnt bring me back week after week
>> ARTICLE
I'm of the opinion that each user here has one or two shows that engross them in one way or another. Mushishi is just that show for me. The way it carries itself plays into what I look for in a show of this nature. I can find an endless amount of small, peripheral things that I appreciate and that keeps me invested and excited for a new story each week.

Yup, I always imagine his narration as a story he's recounting for Tanyu to record.

Well, it's hard to not win when your only competition is literally soulless.
>> ARTICLE
I think with Mushishi, at least it feels like Ginko will carry on even if we don't get to see it anymore.

So while it will be sad to see it end, at least it doesn't feel like an absolute finality to me. Because it feels like the lives of the characters will continue onward.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely. The show established everything it needed in order to leave me with that feeling, but letting go still feels like a hurdle.

Is there some Japanese tradition about holding on to the umbilical cord? Why did they still have it after all those years?

EDIT: Actually did some googling. Apparently there is such a [tradition] (http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2002/09/08/general/the-japanese-attachment-to-umbilical-cords/#.VIOYZjHF9tU) TIL

I know my parents had mine as well. I'm white with no association with any oriental ancestry so the tradition carries on in the states somewhat as well.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow every episode of this show leaves me with an empty feeling, a longing for it to continue and never stop. This feeling is one I only ever get from the endings of truly fantastic series, yet every episode of Mushishi gives me this feeling. And somehow, it keeps getting better.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, two depressing episodes in a row.

On a side note, I really love how the scroll is written in feudal-style kanji+katakana, but the grammar is still completely modern :p It's a neat touch.

The lightning sound effects were really great.

Any idea how many episodes we have left?
>> ARTICLE
What was in the boy's hand at the end?
>> ARTICLE
Me think its the remain of the umbilical cord seeing as it is a important plot item with its multiple subtle meanings such as the connection of mother and child.

Mushishi never cease to amaze how beautiful a story can be told in such subtle, gentle and quite way as if whispering a intimate secret into your ear.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, definitely umbilical cord.

>Mushishi never cease to amaze how beautiful a story can be told in such subtle, gentle and quite way as if whispering a intimate secret into your ear.

Love that description. Very fitting.

I absolutly love the tales of Mushishi.

It's just interesting to see and all the ideas...

I would watch hundrets of episodes if i could.
>> ARTICLE
Am I wrong or did the mother want him to get hit by lightning?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that was the whole point of this story. The mother was forced into this marriage. That's why she just couldn't love the child she had with the husband she didn't want.
It went so far that she wanted to die herself and didn't care about her son dying or not.

...I really liked this episode.
>> ARTICLE
It was a pretty dark episode when compared to the rest. 

... I liked it as well. Ginko the psychologist.   
>> ARTICLE
You could almost say that he's one of those in most of the episodes, I think. In almost all cases, the mushi causing the problem is merely a reflection of one or more of the characters' mental states being given a physical consequence.

The girl who it rains on everywhere she goes, the boy whose skin is cold to the touch and who is constantly thirsty, the old woman who can't quite remember where she comes from, the child who is incredibly strong and quick to anger.

They're all things related to a mushi who, although being neither good nor evil, causes problems for them that manifest in ways that are almost always completely interlaced symbolically with what the characters of each particular episode are going through.

Then Ginko comes along and usually finds a way to cure them or exorcise the mushi in some way, which in turn resolves the psychological struggle which is occurring in those people. There are some blatant exceptions to make it clear that sometimes life is just a bitch, and that no matter how you try sometimes things will go wrong that can't be fixed. But there's always a meaningful psychological lesson that it brings for the people involved, usually but not always from Ginko.

...sorry for the long-winded necro post, I should've just said "Yeah!" That's enough ranting on from me.
>> ARTICLE
No problem. I loved the ending with the time loop, when the man decides to be devoured by the mushi, but his wife is then then locked in the time loop and they can spend at least one more iteration of time together.

Onions.
>> ARTICLE
This episode had Ginko display a lot more emotion than usual, which is a little bit weird. Yet, it added to the raw emotion of the story. The raw emotion that has Mushi-Shi to entail the audience, makes Mushi-Shi one of the best anime of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
FYI this is not "Also knows as: Episode 18", but rather 20. Just thought I'd mention since I accidentally read spoilers.

*WHAT A BIIIII*^*I*^^*I*^^^*I*^^^*T*^^^^*C*^^^^^*H!*

Seriously, fuck that woman. I get that she's unhappy because she got forced into arranged marriage, but a) she could have eloped, it's not like that hadn't happened back then, and b) leave the kid out of this, you stupid, petty cunt. I like how even animators have drawn her as physically unattractive. Just compare her to any other young-to-milf girls in Mushishi. Her turtle face betrays her character - that of a reptile that would eat its young. Who gives a fuck if she's haunted by the memories? She deserves worse. God damn it, usually Mushishi soothes me, but this episode just pissed me off.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think her character was drawn to look unattractive, it was a pretty standard looking face for the series. Also she is in the depths of depression and has limited free will, it isn't her fault that her family sent her off to a place she didn't know to be married to a stranger. I am pretty sure the woman wouldn't just run off with a man in this setting, seeing as it would be looked down upon by the society she was raised in. Sure it isn't the kids fault, but she can't force herself to feel an attachment to him.
>> ARTICLE
This episode is almost a perfect metaphor for social media. I see this on occasion where people living within driving distance of each other would write in FB or some other place things like "I miss you." Go drive over there and have tea together, you lazy f*cks.

This episode really reminded me of the yuri genre. Not only the fact that there were two females who are deeply emotionally attached to each other, but the societal pressure forcing them apart, as well as their own guilt regarding their relationship. In the end the solution to the girl's problems was right in front of everyone, but no one wanted to acknowledge it. Did anyone else get similar vibes, and do you think it's intentional?
>> ARTICLE
It did, but at the same time it was more of a little girl with a huge mother's complex instead of a romantic relationship. So the dad's solution made sense had the mushi not been there. At the end of the day, the girl still rejects others and is just as clingy as before though. Just goes to show that Ginko can't just come in for a few days and fix long-time issues other characters have, which is a good takeaway from this episode in my opinion.

**Mind-dump**

> I've known that old man since he was a young one

For some reason I feel I laughed way too hard at this line.

A true testament to Mushishi's storytelling is how it weaves an otherwise straightforward tale into something more enriching. The episode starts simply enough. Kanta seeks to remain untethered through his work while his wife, family, and village both express and represent a force exerted on him to settle down. After consuming the fruit of the entity that solidified the stability of the village that would welcome him should he choose to stay, he is forcibly bound by that entity and shown the history that it has recorded. Kanta doesn't take this well at first. He's shown to be haggard and deflects his daughter because he feels that he has no value in this state. But the knowledge that he is bestowed ends up saving the village *because* the villagers still hold him in high regard and work with him to minimize the damage of the earthquake/mudslide event. He seems to accept his new role in the final scene after his prior skill set ironically becomes needed when Kanta no longer possesses the capacity to perform that work.

**Things I appreciated**

* The amount of detail in some of these shots was staggering, especially in shots where the camera focused toward the ground or on the wildlife that the Eternity Tree saw.
* Ginko basically querying the collective of Mushishis for some form of remedy. Again he passes no judgment on the inflicted, perhaps merely nudging Kanta in his acceptance of his new role.
* Nui describes the tree as "watching", not interfering. It is said to be immune to the actions of man, but both neglecting it and venerating it are shown to have negative effects.

**Thoughts**

In a way, I'm relieved that I don't have to say goodbye to Mushishi for a while. Knowing that the conclusion has yet to come softens the blow of its departure for the time being. The movie was teased for all of 2 seconds and the prospect of checking this out in a theater entices me to no end.
>> ARTICLE
Great summary, and I agree about your analysis. I also can't wait for the movie to air...since it's Aniplex maybe we'll get a small theatrical run here in the states.
>> ARTICLE
> since it's Aniplex maybe we'll get a small theatrical run here in the states.

I wish I could be optimistic, but really, I see no chance of this happening.
>> ARTICLE
The distributor is Aniplex?! I feel silly for not noticing that on the Crunchyroll page. There is hope! I had the good fortune of getting to see [Expelled from Paradise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13391) - also Aniplex - in a theater not to far from me so fingers crossed that this increases the likelihood of a foreign premiere.
>> ARTICLE
derailing from mushishi, how was Expelled? It screened close to where I live but the CGI looked pretty bad from the PVs I saw. The only hook for was the Butcher's name on the poster. Was it any good?
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed it. It sells itself through high-intensity action, light mystery, and the unlikely-duo-settling-into-each-other dynamic. It had an interesting take on the tragedy of the commons and future of humanity at large. If you expect fun, you'll certainly get it here.

From the director himself [paraphrased], the visuals are "3DCGI meant to mimic cell animation". You'll only ever notice any awkwardness when the characters are moving mid-range in the depth of field and a few lip movements from Angela that felt akin to South Park. Otherwise, I thought it looked really good.

On the Urobuchi front, there is one conversation between Dingo & Angela in which they debate the implications of two different societal models and it's pure, uncut Butcher philosophy. Human Spirit. The ruthlessness of utilitarianism. Very keen and insightful with its application of technology in that regard. Otherwise it's absent for the most part.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked this episode. The characters Kanta and the tree contrasted very well. And as Mushishi often does, it balanced a sense of despair beautifully with a sense of hope.\\

I had resigned myself to Kanta's fate as Kanta did, right before he noticed the red flowers. And then I feared for Kanta in particular, either because of a kind of organ rejection like scenario caused by the mushi, where either his body or the mushi rejected the other enough to endanger both. But it ended up being the salvation of the village. It wasn't a joyous ending; the village was destroyed and Kanta still has to live with his legs, but the events weren't devastating, as I expected them to be. I thought this was a great episode to end the second season with (even though I feel like the movie will be the official cap).\\

I like that Mushishi bounces between happy endings, unsettling endings, and balanced endings like this one. The entire series has a balanced feeling that way, and I feel like that balance touches deeper emotions than those that are stirred by shows that reach for passionate emotions. They're emotions that kind of sit in me, and aren't swept away after the moment is gone. Great things come from both sets of emotions, but Mushishi is one of the few shows I know that goes for the deeper set, and I really appreciate it. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's interesting that this series Ginko has been less involved in the story and more of an informer and observer than a fixer of problems.

[Mushishi Zoku Shou S2 Episode 10 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/12/mushishi-zoku-shou-2nd-season-episode-10.html)
>> ARTICLE
Well all that is left is to look forward to the movie coming out in the summer. All in all this has been a really good season as to be expected from this series. 
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me being picky, or do they use one same character model for every man and one for every girl? 
>> ARTICLE
It's just the art style of the manga artist. She has shown that she can design dynamic characters, so I believe that she keeps her Mushishi off-character designs simplistic in order to reflect simple Japanese pre-industry living. 

Edit: Gender

Yuki Urushibara is a female mangaka, actually.

We'll she is damn good I must say.

Corrected, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I loved this episode. A really well told story, and a very positive message and outcome.


>> ARTICLE
The plum was well worth it, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Overall, this season had a complete different feel than the previous seasons. I'm not sure how I feel about Ginko having less of a role than before. Its been mostly stuff happening and Ginko being there to explain to the audience what is going on. 
>> ARTICLE
When Kanta's legs started flowering, I was concerned he was depressed with his fate and becoming suicidal. Happy that it ended differently. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the best part of the episode was when she decided not to touch the life sparks at the end - knowing how much pain her family went through prior.

I wish we had more Ginko in these episodes though - it seems this season is really sparse.
>> ARTICLE
Why was she even tempted to go there *again*? I'm not sure, if I understood that part correctly
>> ARTICLE
I don't think she was tempted per say, I think the beautiful light just captivated her like it had prior. Only this time she had gone through the ordeal and knew the pain it had caused so instead she just enjoyed the moment.
>> ARTICLE
I always try to find links between mushishi and possible situations they could be applicable to in real life. This episode makes me think of being captivated in your own interest to a point of addiction. She loves the lights so much she forgets her family and herself while still being supported by her family through food and the doll. Also she is the only ones that can see the lights causing disconnect between her and her family.Parallels could be drawn between a drug addict still living at home causing problems for immediate family while ignorant of the fact because they to focused on themselves
It ends with the girl still drawn to the light but having set personal boundries so she can enjoy her interest while not losing herself.

This conclusion is a recurring theme in mushishi. In "Raindrops and Rainbows" parallels can be made with the father chasing the rainbow being a victim of addiction and the effect it has on his family and how addiction can be transferred to your children. The ending is also about appreciation of beauty but not letting it take hold of you.

In "Floral Delusion" the family that takes care of the blind deaf woman think she is so beautiful that they are addicted to her. Doing everything  they can to keep her alive at the cost of innocent people. Again the ending is 2 men standing and appreciating the beauty of the sakura tree(The girl is a symbol for the tree) and then moving on.

I think mushishi is trying to tell me that even though you enjoy your own interests please don't forget about the rest of live
>> ARTICLE
So Mushishi is the antithesis of otaku-ism?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i think so. Thats a great title for my post actually.
>> ARTICLE
I really like how the girl never really felt alone despite being visually presented that way. Would've been easy to portray her as isolated and lonely but instead the episode focused on how the love of her mother and sister kept her from feeling that way.
>> ARTICLE
This episode seemed to wrap up pretty quickly, also the mushi world just get more and more bizare. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode really felt like it went by so fast. It was another wonderful episode though. When in the well world how all the sounds were dull and echoed a bit was a nice touch, and watching Ginko fade away back to the other side was really well done animation. A lot of the transitions between scenes were wonderfully done as well.
>> ARTICLE
Feeling like you're alone even though you know you're not. Not being able to see or hear the people right in front of you. Being blinded by something unimportant while the people who care about you worry. I think a lot of people can relate to that.

Mushishi always makes me reflect on something about myself that I wouldn't have otherwise. As long as it keeps you thinking, it's accomplished its goal. A great series. I don't think I can ever dislike an episode of this show.

In a time where almost every other anime is about cramming as many events into one episode as possible, Mushishi takes one small event and lets you reflect on it. No world-saving or world-changing hero, just one man travelling around and helping people see what's important to them. It's so soothing.
>> ARTICLE
This story was great, and very surreal. Funny enough however it brings to   mind some of the things scientists are learning more about recently. Not   going to explain it, but maybe this episode was made more subconsciously   knowing of these things.

I'm very curious as to what things scientist are learning more about?

How come every week there's a comment like this... Let people enjoy the show the way they want to. It is not something you debate or discuss with other people. Mushishi is an anime to reflect with yourself. At least that's my opinion. 

>> ARTICLE
Yup, I watch it every week, but I have nothing to say. The show also doesn't have that man watchers in the first place. The MAL stat has  8,128 watching. I imagine many people might wait until the season is over to watch as well.
>> ARTICLE
That might be the most shocked I've ever seen Ginko. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt like that would have been a good opportunity for him to have been smoking and just let his cigarette fall out of his mouth in shock.
>> ARTICLE
Today's episode really hit the spot. The story did a really good job of building up the recovery of Yuuta to make the final disappearance hit that much harder. The series itself has set up such a good rhythm of Ginko successfully helping those who follow his instructions that seeing his oversight lead to a complete failure came out of nowhere. Of course, he returns to his typical self after the fact, but the shock, confusion and fear that overcome him when Yuuta evaporated was such an unexpected and atypical expression that it's effect was almost harrowing. 

EDIT: Thinking over it, did Ginko Really fail? I wonder if knowing the full story in the beginning would have allowed him to approach the situation differently. 

As a side note I think that this particular case had Ginko Returning much more often than other long term cases than he has had before. 

>> ARTICLE
I think the point was that it was inevitable that this would happen to her son. The loss was inevitable, and it was only then about how you react to it. Even if Ginko knew the full story from the start, there was probably nothing he could have done. As he said, her child and the mushi fused at birth. They were basically one and the same.

I think the most difficult thing to accept when something terrible like this happens is that there really was nothing you could have done. That makes people feel very empty for a long time afterwards. Losing a loved one in tragic circumstances. "I couldn't save him" or "In his last moments I couldn't do anything for him" or "I wasn't there". That's what I think most of the regret, when it comes to loss, comes from.

Sometimes bad things happen that are inevitable, and it's just about how you deal with that fate, accept it and move on. There's no shounen plot armour in real life.
>> ARTICLE
I was kinda surprised the mom didn't blame Ginko at first, she just lost her son and I'm pretty sure she wasn't thinking rationally in that moment. That probably would have unsettled him even more.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was interesting. This episode offered an interesting contrast from when Ginko usually fails. Normally his treatments don't work because there is someone who is all "I don't need this damn mushi crap!" or "Ehh, that creepy white haired dude told me not to do the thing, but he hasn't been around for a while now, I guess I can do the thing." But this one was almost entirely on Ginko. 

As for the mother, I think the reason she wasn't mad either had to have been her acknowledgment that Ginko was honestly doing his best to help them, or that she knew secretly all along that Yuuta was living on borrowed time. She had already experienced his death twice (once when she drowned, once when he was born and they thought he was dad) so she could have just been prepared for it. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the biggest thing is that there is absolutely nothing he couldve done apparently.


>> ARTICLE
It was very refreshing to see an episode go in that direction. I never realized that I actually really wanted to see Ginko fail for once. He always appears to know everything that he needs to know in order to handle a situation. Especially last week when he managed to pull a girl out of *another dimension,* and it was even implied that other mushishi had failed before him. I did love that episode of course, but no one is that great. 

I really like the message in this episode though. The mother was given a few years with her son that she would otherwise have been without. It is sad to loose a loved one, but she should be grateful for the time that she had with him. He was given to her, and then he was returned. This applies to any death, but this narrative made it easy to make that rationalization. 
>> ARTICLE
Only let down that I had in this episode is that I expected a stronger emotional reaction from the mother when her son vanished. 
>> ARTICLE
Well. That's biggest downer Mushishi's ever ended on.
>> ARTICLE
I had a feeling thing wrapped up too neatly, and then the kid evaporates. 
>> ARTICLE
When the kid evaporates at 17:00, I was like, "Shit, the kid is dead unless if Ginko pulls a really fast move to save him." The kid didn't survive :( 

Still, the episode showed the power of the love that a mother/father (mother in this case) has over their children even if there is something wrong with the child. For example, there parents with children who had autism, but for many parents, autism or any other diagnosis only strengthens the bond between the parent and child.

Damn Ginko, you killed a kid. I guess that's how surgeons must feel when they wrongly diagnose someone, operate, and then that person dies. In both cases they leave the broken shell of a family afterwards. 
>> ARTICLE
That kid merged with the mushi before he was even born. He was eventually going to be part of that mushi's life cycle whether Ginko did anything or not. There's nothing Ginko could've done even if he knew this before hand. What he did is give the mother and son a normal life even just for a short while.
>> ARTICLE
> There's nothing Ginko could've done even if he knew this before hand.

We don't know that. Ginko has proven to be pretty resourceful given that he knows exactly which mushi is affecting someone, and to what extent.  
If the kid managed to live through several years of rains and floods, he'd live through more.

> What he did is give the mother and son a normal life even just for a short while.

They weren't unhappy before he had given them the brew. Sure, kid was a little cold and a hair's breadth from being a windowlicker intellectually, but they loved each other as parent and child. I'm sure she'd be happier with his kid still around, even if warped.
>> ARTICLE
The mushi gave the kid couple of more years to live, episodes like this shows the harmony of the mushi and humans and how mushi can help humans (I'm saying this now as I also just finished watching the Light Thread episode). 
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap. This season's been especially dark. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that was a very dark episode as opposed to the other episodes which were more sad. I think it was the fact that the dude was willing to kill his nephew, even after his nephew said that he didn't hate him, that I found most disturbing. 
>> ARTICLE
In for a penny, in for a pound. :\
>> ARTICLE
There was a lot going on in this episode, from the powerful visual metaphor of carrying vestiges of the deceased to Ginko letting Sousuke talk through his lingering hang-ups on the callous custom of abandoning the dead on the mountain and losing his father. Mushishi places its exploration of human drama above all else, and this is reflected in the manner in which Ginko conducts his investigations and the degree of his success in applying some form of remedy. When questioning Shigeru, Ginko abruptly stops before any inferences or accusations can be made on his behalf. Shigeru was seeking forgiveness not unlike what he denied his brother Shinobu. But Ginko is not here to deliver that, and Shigeru meets his demise when Sousuke denies him that release as well in their final confrontation.

Mud Grass bears the signature mark of beauty in aesthetic that we've come to expect in the show, but this story is relentlessly brutal. Not an offering I've come to expect of the show, but one that I'll certainly accept.

Three weeks until the final chapter. There is much to do to prepare myself for it.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is great that way in that some of the human drama might even be mundane if it isn't enhanced by the supernatural and given a twist to look at the drama from another angle. Mushishi reminds me of some of the better X-Files episodes in that regard, where the human drama is filtered through the mysterious and the supernatural. So even when the themes may not exactly be the most innovative, the way they're approached is unique thanks to the mushi interaction.
>> ARTICLE
Wow a fantastic - yet dark- episode. I was trying to play detective on how the weed was growing on the uncle towards the start; but once we got to the reveal of him murdering his brother out of rage I couldn't look away. It was an engrossing episode to watch, even if it was really dark as others have said.
>> ARTICLE
The question is was that grass silhouette the nephew's or the Uncle's? I am guessing the uncle's as his body probably washed up further up stream and the silhouette looked too big to be the nephew's.
>> ARTICLE
It's the uncle's. Ginko even mentioned at the end how he didn't even get to return to the mountains. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode gave me the heebie jeebies. Having uncontrollable warts/plants/parasites growing on me is one of my biggest fears tbh
>> ARTICLE
I was squirming the entire time. This episode was really uncomfortable for me as well.
>> ARTICLE
I love Ginko's thought process. He's very different from "shamans" portrayed in anime - he thinks like a doctor, a *scientist*, which is rather unusual in an universe where exist god-like creatures like mushi (everything from causing wind, through summoning rain, time manipulation, and ending in alternate fucking dimensions).

Oh, and *fuck me* that scene where murderer thinks he sees his brother's corpse apologizing to him... "Nii-san... So sorry...". Bloody hell, I haven't been so scared since Ghost Hunt episode with Urado.
>> ARTICLE
Argh, this episode made me so uncomfortable all over while I was watching it since I kept on getting goosebumps every few minutes (because they continue to show the seeds/warts on people).

Just when I thought I was sort of getting used to that they show us the uncle with the actual weed/dead grass growing on him. 

I watched every episode of Mushishi and had only been slightly discomforted by that one episode where there were mushi in the girl's eyes. But this one is on another level, more akin to nightmare fuel but it's still such a beautifully woven story.

Pretty sure this is the episode I'll skip if I re-watch Mushishi again though. orz I'm still getting goosebumps even after the show is over. I think the idea of growing those seeds/weeds on your body is just a really disturbing thought. LOL I think I'd rank this as the most disturbing episode of mushishi I've watched yet.
>> ARTICLE
The other one like this I remember was that one where the lady mushishi had the plant growing in her lungs or something, or the one where the couple gives birth to multiple spore kids. *shivers* Needless to say, I'm generally not in a hurry to rewatch those.

But yeah, combine the seeds and weeds with the dark subject matter, and it goes up there with the tree episode from earlier this year in creepiness (that tree one was practically Criminal Minds level but without the squick factor today's had).
>> ARTICLE
Oh god that spore one. I've still had nightmares about that one.
>> ARTICLE
The spore one wasn't too bad tbh, I didn't feel any discomfort for those since it's not really something akin to body horror in a way? (I actually don't remember the plant growing in the lady mushishi's lungs.. was it the same mushishi that acted as Ginko's mentor?)

But yeah oh man, I like how Ginko's basically pointing out the truth without saying it directly and not judge the uncle for it? He sort of leaves it out there that he knows what the uncle did, but he'll still try to help as a mushishi. 

Even now I'm still having goosebumps here and there, argh this is going to take a while to get rid of. I regret watching this last after all my usual Saturday animes haha.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, she might not have been a mushishi, been a while since I watched that one. And yeah, different people get squicked by different things, since the spore one got to me more than today's.

And yes, I loved how Ginko handled it. He knows and is willing to help, but at the end of the day it was up to the uncle to do what needed to be done and I think they both knew that. I was sad but not entirely surprised at how the uncle decided to handle it. :(

HummingBird is the only website where the original series has a higher rating than R2.

That's actually a really weird statistic. Normally, the second season is higher rated simply because the people who dislike the series never get to it. They drop it in the first season and then never touch the second season, resulting in slight inflation. On Hummingbird, the general userbase agrees that R2 was a large enough drop in quality from R1 that they even get past this inflation. My own opinion on R2 vs R1 aside, this is a pretty interesting statistic.

It would have been easier with an entire freaking army to capture the people he wanted to protect from the school and keep them in the military base, but being smarter than everyone else and overcomplicating things is what leluch (sp) did best.

Personally, I think R1 is much better than R2 simply because R2 is such an insane trainwreck. The ending saved it from having a lower rating than what I currently think of it.
>> ARTICLE
I actually felt completely different. I felt R1 was the trainwreck and R1's ending/R2 saved the series for me.  I even rewatched the series and came to the same conclusion. Of course, R2 (and R1) had lots of flaws themselves, but I just cant imagine Code Geass as a whole being better without R2. Maybe a better way of putting is I think R2 had higher highs and lower lows than R1. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel as if R1 was better because it was more strategic. R2 basically devolved into whoever had the best mech would naturally win. Oh shit that mech is so powerful, oh man now my mech has new stuff on it so I'm better, OH SHIT I HAVE A MECH THAT CAN DESTROY EVERYTHING WHILE STANDING STILL AND SHOOTING LASERS. Though the ending was very very good for R2 which is why people rate it highly imo. 
>> ARTICLE
I get that, but I dont see why people treat them almost as two different shows because of it.

R1 still had lots of strong mechs that single handedly turned around the battlefield and made strategy redundant. Examples include the the always incredible Lancerlot, Gurren and Lelouch's fucking Gawain)

R2 still had a lots of strategy and wit underneath the fights, including the escape from the chinese, the destruction of the tower, strategic positioning of the armies in the huge final battle. All of this that people *seemingly* forget just because there is a Lancelot and Gurren flying around.

You see. People act as if there are two extremes, R1 was prefect strategy and R2 was a stupid mecha-power circlejerk. But if you look closely, you can see each season actually has a lot of both. This is why I think the distinction between R1 being 'so much better' than R2 is just foolish. Strong Mechs and Strategy *is* Code Geass. If you just want strong mechs, go watch Gundam, if you just want strategy, go watch Legend of the Galactic Heros. But you cant just like Code Geass and then ignore half of what it is. Accept all of it or none of it.
>> ARTICLE
I just wish someone could explain to me why R2 was a trainwreck. What am I missing?
>> ARTICLE
I think it mostly boils down to the fact that the plot goes a bit haywire and introduces a ton of meaningless characters. I personally consider Code Geass one of my favorite animes but I honestly can't recall anything that happens between s2e1 - s2e22. It's very unmemorable save for the ending.

[CG R2](/s "Sure you can! For example, one of the best scenes in the entire show is when Rolo kills Shirley. The bunney suit Kallen is all over the place too. What about how freaking cool Suzaku as a knight is!?")

MAL should seriously combine all the Gintama series except for the movies .

By the time the new Gintama comes this year  im 100% sure half of the list of the top 10 would be Gintama for a long long time  and I love gintama but still !
>> ARTICLE
I agree that MAL should reconsider when they combine entries. However doing so presents some clear challenges.

Firstly there's the question of what you do on the database side when combining series. Delete everyone's old ratings or try to average them out? At some level you'll lose data because inactive users won't come back and change their ratings, and inevitably you lose the information of which half is higher rated (even though selection bias arguably makes that question meaningless).

Secondly you open the more difficult can of worms of what criteria should be used to determine when series should be combined? When the second season follows directly from the first in style? When they air within enough time of each-other? When the MAL user base votes that they should be combined? What about splitting up Death Note into two halves on the same basis or going all the way and rating individual episodes?

I think it's clear that MAL will need a better system for dealing with the fact that most anime now take up several MAL entries, in this age where increasingly a show will get an 11 episode first season, 9 or so 2 minute specials, an OVA episode, a split cour second season, recap movies and finally a sequel movie.

The solution that I do think will eventually be implemented will actually be some sort of franchise system, but even that presents the problem of how do you divide up something like all the Ghost in the Shell anime.
>> ARTICLE
Easy

Allow a rating for the entire franchise but also allow people to rate individual seasons/segments/episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Consider the following example with made up ratings that do not reflect my actual opinion:

GITS SAC 2 episode 11 is rated 8.48

GITS SAC 2 is rated 8.55

GITS SAC (S1 + S2 + Solid State Society + Solid State Society 3D + Laughing Man +  Individual Eleven + ...) is rated 8.62

GITS ( GITS + Innocence + 2.0 + ARISE + SAC + GITS 2015 + ...) is rated 8.34.

Personally I think that's a lot of data to process at once. Furthermore it would put a strain on the servers to store that much more data as well as all the calculations needed to pool all those numbers together. I don't think it's impossible or even a bad idea per se, but I do think it would be difficult to implement in such a way that it's nice to use (both in terms of performance and UI).

I always find it endearingly peculiar that the ANN top 25 has three Maria-sama ga Miteru seasons. By the way, it's a very pleasant series.

[All the seasons are on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4U0FQ15BX8D1-lCVHli3WNK7KhVOuBtH)
>> ARTICLE
Now that you've pointed that out I've been consumed by curiosity? Was it a belligerent effort by /u/ or some such organization in a bygone era? Do ANN's users happen to be similar to the other sites for the most part, but have an unusually high ratio of Class S fans? Is this an oddity of the algorithm ANN uses to get their averages?

Cowboy Bebop and Baccano! both in the top 25 on hummingbird, with Bebop nearly in the top 5. Sounds like my kind of site

It's fairly out of date at this point, but if we're looking at lists, [there's also this AniMetaCritic List](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/) from The Cart Driver, which compiled the MAL ratings of a bunch of anime critics/bloggers. It's unsurprisingly slanted towards the kinds of shows beloved by people who like to write a lot of words about their media, but with a number of surprising picks as well.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow nothing in the top 11 surprises me, except maybe Aria. Didn't know it was that well acclaimed critically.

It's likely just reflective of the general self-selection that goes into sequel ratings - if you're watching the third Aria series, you're probably a person who's inclined to like Aria.

Cross Game and Nodame in the top 25, could AniDB actually have good taste?!

Summer Wars should be bolded, looks like.

Don't say such things around here, people will run you out of town for liking good anime.

I enjoyed Cross Game, would you recommend the other 2? 
>> ARTICLE
If you have any classical training or just enjoy classical music, you will love Nodame. If you liked anything like Honey & Clover, you'll still like it even without that.

Summer Wars is basically my favorite movie ever.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. Think I'll also check out Summer Wars because I looked it up a while back and the bunny looks pretty cool from what I can tell. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved Nodame. It's a music slice of life, so if you're not into that, don't watch it, but the characters were nice, the music was fantastic, and I enjoyed it thoroughly to watch all 3 seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. I'm meh with slice of life. Last one I saw was Nichijou which was hilarious but I'll give it a shot if I'm in a slice of life mood!
>> ARTICLE
The AniDB results look majorly affected by the fact so many of their entries have so few ratings. Nodame has 6490 AniDB ratings compared to MAL 51210 ratings and Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season has 437 AniDB ratings compared to 8695 MAL ratings. Furthermore they seem to inconsistently amalgamate anime with all 3 Madoka Movies occupying a single entry and Mushishi Zoku Shou having 2 entries.

That's not to say that it's not possible that AniDB has good taste per se, but rather that their top rated anime list is messed up.
>> ARTICLE
Ima get rekt by downvotes for this, but **seriously,** why is FMA: B so universally loved? I watched the whole series 3 times just trying to understand what I was evidentially missing; as far as I could see it was just averagely good?
>> ARTICLE
One of the few shows that goes on for that long and actually has a cohesive, structured beginning, middle and end. Just a well told story is all.
>> ARTICLE
It's the anime equivalent of a western fantasy novel. Great world building, unique story, diverse cast, great character development, some twists and turns, satisfying ending, mix of action, drama, and humour, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I think to get at the top of lists like this, it's less important for it to be loved, than for no one to hate it. It also benefits from fame and popularity - it gets voted 10/10 by a lot of a newcomer anime watchers who have nothing else to compare it to.

It also exemplifies really well its genre. People who won't like FMA:B don't watch it in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Because its a perfect 10. The way they blend the dramatic moments with the soundtracks (and sometimes ED), the action is top notch, the VA's are *phenomenal* and its funny. 

Whats not to like? 
>> ARTICLE
different people like different things
>> ARTICLE
Can different people think different things?
>> ARTICLE
you don't say
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't mean that those different people liking different things don't have their own personal reasons for liking those different things.  lilelf29 probably was asking for examples of those personal reasons specifically referring to why people like FMA:B.

Basically, why do different people like different things?
>> ARTICLE
A big reason is because it's an easy to reccomend show, free of some of the dumb tropes that plague anime like random upskirts, MC's falling on vags, etc. I did like it a lot, but I definitely find some big problems with it, my main one being the ending. The main villain was probably one of the most boring villains in anime, and that ending was so shonen it was unreal. I actually thought that the original FMA was better, the villain was more interesting, and the beginning was much better (they skipped a lot in brotherhood)
>> ARTICLE
The biggest thing is that it's just a very solid show across almost all aspects. It is a great first anime and can appeal to everyone with a story that can be embraced by all, yet still holds quirks that make it uniquely it's own and uniquely an anime. It doesn't seem to excel at one particular thing, be it animation or sound or drama or comedy, but it still does all of those elements very well, and the combined overall goodness is it's biggest appeal. It's a jack of all trades in a way, and it just an overall balanced show. It also helps that the plot is one of the most well wrapped up storylines I can recall, and that "OHMYFUCKINGGOD" moment when everything comes together is really memorable.
>> ARTICLE
It has the largest draw and I think is consistently good in all aspects and all around very enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's universal. Anybody of about 12 or older could watch it and enjoy it. It's got good animation, well fleshed out characters, a great and original story, and plenty of philosophy. It's got funny, happy, sad, exciting, tense, scary, and thought provoking moments all wrapped up in one 60 episode series. It can be shown to anybody as a sort of "entrance to anime," yet a veteran watcher can enjoy it just as much. It has very few flaws (nearly none, actually) and does everything it tries to do extremely well. It covers all of it's bases; It ends the story in a satisfying way, it fleshes out it's characters thoughts, feelings, and actions and the reasons for each, it doesn't use bad CG and has an appealing art style, the pacing is good and doesn't leave much to be desired, it has a good english dub, and a million other things.

The show is just perfection incarnate. It's good because it doesn't fuck up. Steins;gate fans will admit that the show up until the latter half was slow and uninteresting. Gurren Lagann fans will say that Yoko was a bit overly sexualized, and that some bits at the end could have been omitted for sake of time. Cowboy Bebop fans (like me) will admit that the episodic nature bores some people, and the show is really only a 7 or 8 out of 10 until you've seen [spoilers](/s "the last episode"). But FMA:B is just ***good***. It's not that something about it is so keenly sharpened that it stands out. It's like a clean, sharp kitchen knife. It's not your sharpest, but it's flawless. It shines, no scratches, cuts everything equally without fail.

Maybe I'm exaggerating when I say it's perfect, but it's damn near it. I would go as far as to say it has no glaring flaws at all. But yeah. That is, at least, my take on why it's considered the best. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your detailed reply, you have convinced me to give FMA:B another try.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but as an FMA:B fan, I can easily admit the show leans too heavily on the action shonen tropes (The whole last few episodes in particular) and Ed and Al are very sidelined down the line. The first 13 episodes are also rushed through pretty hard, which makes some scenes lack a lot of emotional power. Not only that, the humour can easily come off as obnoxious due to its placement (IMO its better in the manga). FMA:B absolutely is great, and it does have a universal popularity factor that pushes it forward for the younger audience of anime, but to say it has no points of contempt is absolutely ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly your point about the rushed early story is why I recommend starting with FMA if you're at all interested in the fullest experience. I'd say as a whole the original FMA is much weaker, but after watching it first FMA:B's beginning was VERY short indeed. I didn't care too much because I wasn't really looking to re-watch all of that again, and I think that might have been something the creators considered.
>> ARTICLE
As I always say,  FMA: B assumes you've watched FMA, so it skims over the beginning
>> ARTICLE
> I watched the whole series 3 times to understand what I was evidentially missing...

There are shows that I adore that I haven't watched that many times.  Maybe you like FMA:B more than you think?


>> ARTICLE
I think Brotherhood is so widely enjoyed because it's the most western. Other factors help, of course. The source material was incredibly well-written, and the adaptation was extremely faithful. Few anime tell a single overarching story so well, connecting every dot and and plot point. I could talk about why I like Brotherhood for hours.

But if you ask why it's so universally loved, I think the lack of Japanese influence is a big factor. No difficult to pronounce names with difficult-to-translate symbolism, no unfamiliar references or settings, and very little reliance on puns or wordplay for humor. I struggle to think of anime with as little to do with Japan as FMA: Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
You could actually be on to something there as I would say AoT is similar in terms of being western and it didn't enjoy it.

The animation quality was flawelss in AoT, but just about everything else was pretty poor imo.
>> ARTICLE
How did it in Japan?
>> ARTICLE
Really average actually. I don't remember exact numbers but the Blurays sold under 10k, maybe closer to 5~7k, despite the manga's immense popularity. To put it into perspective FMA:B sold as well as Guilty Crown, slightly better than Dog Days S1 and less than Hyouka. 

FMA:B was quite a long series though so that may attribute to its low sales. 
>> ARTICLE
I've got another one:  Attack on Titan is also a strictly western setting.  Based on its popularity I'd say your diagnosis is correct.
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B is just the anime that appeals to the most people. There's lots of action which appeals to a younger audience, yet there's also science, strategy, and questions about humanity and religion which appeals to an older audience. There's some very sad moments and a lot of comedy. There's some romance but it doesn't spend too much time on it. While FMA:B is outclassed by other anime in pretty much every area, FMA:B is at worst considered averagely good and many people consider it the best anime because it has so many different aspects going for it.

I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time, as bold of a claim as that may sound. It's what happens when you mix in a perfect adaptation of the source material from an anime studio with absolutely phenomenal writing. And to have that consistency in both writing and animation for a full 150 episodes is what solidifies it as one of the best. 
>> ARTICLE
> I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time

And not everyone shares that opinion as evident by a couple of top 25's. I think that's fine, it would be rather boring if everyone likes the same things. As they say, variety is the spice of life.

That's true, and I'm not necessarily saying that these rankings are literally wrong just because HxH is not on it, because there are a lot of anime deserving of a top 25 spot. Simply explaining to /u/Heizenberg what /u/bloodgods was trying to say.

Anime isn't 'dying' but I don't know why these charts would make for a convincing argument that it isn't.

What the airing year table tells us is that anime fans have only a very limited sense of the anime past.

Might get some hate for this, but since it's in 4 of the 5 lists now's as good a place as any to say it: 

Wolf Children isn't as good as everyone says it is, and I don't really think it deserves a spot so high on so many lists. 

Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with plenty of touching scenes and is, without a doubt, visually beautiful. But I don't think it's the masterpiece so many people seem to say it is. I'd hardly call ti equal to most Ghibli movies and, other than having a slightly unusual premise, wasn't anything too special. Since I should probably back up these opinions, I'm going to get into spoilers. So If you haven't seen it: turn back now.

My biggest problem with this movie is the ending(s). I feel almost totally robbed of an emotional climax. Ame becomes the real focus of the story for the last quarter and he's honestly kind of unlikable. For his big emotional scene all we get is a

"No, don't leave" 

"I have to leave" 

"Okay" 

kind of interaction. Which I suppose could be impactfull if they did a little more with it, but as is it feels very anti-climactic. Yuki doesn't even get that. All she gets is one confession of her identity (in an admittedly cool 'shot' where the curtains blow in front of her as she transforms and whatnot) to one kid. I found myself asking what this reveal is supposed to mean for Yuki. Does it mean she's accepted her wolf side even though she wants to be human? If so why does she continue into a life where her wolf side is so hidden? Again, it felt like some big realization or emotional peak was closely missed almost altogether. 

I'm also not a fan of the length/pacing. This movie is just under two hours, but not a whole lot really happens in that time. Some segments feel like they get a huge space of time to be developed even after we already get what's happening (I'm looking at you extended "it's hard to have young kids" montage) and others feel pretty rushed. (particularly the ending) 

It's a good movie, with an excellent premise that looks very nice and has a few interesting time lapse, POV, and other scenes. But beyond that Wolf Children really didn't blow me away like it did so many other people.
>> ARTICLE
All I did after Wolf Children was to go hug my mother, she's raised my brother and I by herself almost single-handedly right after migrating to Australia. The film resonates a lot with me personally so it's one of my top films.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a good film but I can't see any way that it's one of the best 25 anime titles. 

But then again if I wanted a really solid stab at that kind of list I'd assemble a committee of people I trusted and have them fight it out and then write up an opinion with collective responsibility, rather than aggregating the ratings of thousands of randoms.

It's interesting in a kind of anthropological way that thousands of randoms loved Wolf Children to bits.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I accept your opinion, but I disagree.

Let me start by saying that I think that Ghibli is generally overrated. It's sort of funny, because endings are generally where Ghibli falls apart. Miyazaki wants to tie things up too neatly, so the climaxes of his films tends to come out of nowhere, and break the themes and characters of the films just to wrap things up happily. Spirited Away is most egregious for this - no, the film is *not* about the main character's ability to supernaturally sense whether the pigs are her parents what are you even doing Miyazaki!!!

In contrast, I think Hosoda's films have endings that flow naturally out of the themes and characters. Even if this means that they are open ended, or often very unhappy.

The main character of Wolf Children is the mother, Hana. The theme of the story is this core question - can she hold to her resolution that she would allow the wolf children to make their own choices in life, and love them unconditionally for that? Even when the choice is one that she does not want them to make, that takes them away from her? The tension in the story is between that resolution and her desire as a mother to do all that she could possibly can for the children. The story ends when she finalizes this resolution, when the children develop their own choices, when the story moves on from her story to the untold story of these children and how they live the rest of their lives.

The point of the ending is that the viewer occupies the same mental space as Hana. Adulthood comes all too suddenly and against your will. An emotional catharsis is denied. There is no one big realization, only the culmination of small choices that take place without you knowing it. You become only a small part of someone else's story, a story that is denied to you. This is an incredibly brave and personal choice on Hosoda's part, and one big reason I find the film really special. I can understand it not working for everyone though.

(As an aside: Yuki revealing her identity is about the changing of a secret. Her wolf side was previously a secret shared by the three members of the family. Now it's a secret shared with one she loves. Thus, the secret of her wolf side is recontextualised, it's not something that holds her back any more from the human interactions she desires, and so something she resents and fears. But instead it's a moment shared, that binds her *to* those she loves.)
>> ARTICLE
Also something interesting to note is that Hosoda has been clear in interviews that the film is a tribute to his own mother. Yuki and Ame represents himself - the path he felt his mother wanted him to take, and the path that he did take.

I thought the Gintama manga was fairly amusing, but I'm surprised that it rates so high on so many of these lists.
>> ARTICLE
While you don't hear masses of people talking about all the time it's a constant undercurrent. I can't speak about the other sites but on MAL, along with other long shows, it also benefits from the requirement that you need to have seen a fifth of a completed title for your rating to be valid, which means a lot of the people who try and drop it don't register.

I suppose I shall have to try it myself one day.

damn. I see gintama everywhere and probably it'll be longer that one piece, those are good news actually. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok, lets do this... Clannad explain it to me. White album 2 is one of my favorite shows, the relationships portrayed in that show feel very genuine and the struggles the characters have make for a incredible show. I know almost nothing about Clannad other than the character designs put me (way) off and from the few screen grabs I have seen it looks like the literal poster child for generic moe blob harem show.

Are the characters well written? Is the setting actually interesting? Is it more than just a love dodecahedron? I think I just need a push to get over my gripes with how the characters look, but as a outsider it seriously just looks like the most generic 90's Harem anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Its not for everyone, but there is a reason why it is considered a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is rather generic yeah, but its still pretty well writen and the chars are likeable.

Now thw senbd season, Clannad:Afterstory(the one that appears on the tops), it's a whole different beast, while the first 8 ep are rather crappy, when the afterstory kicks in, it just leaves anyone speechless.

It's a family tale, a tale of reconciliation, and the feel trip is otherwordly.

PS: sorry for typos
>> ARTICLE
I literally stopped like 7 or 8 episodes in and haven't touched it yet. It just bored me to death, so I moved on to something else. Maybe I'll give it another try.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't give it another try, I watched the entire two series because people kept saying it got better. 

*It gets better after the Fuko Arc*

*It gets better at AS*

*It gets better in the second half of AS*

*The last few episodes make the series*

Complete waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
I came into afterstory expecting too much (reading all the hype for it) after watching clannad. I was always waiting for that special moment to happen and i was waiting to be impressed for the entire series yet nothing spectacular or minblowing ever happened. Sure there were sad moments but didn't make up for the boring first 15 episodes. So clannad and AS as a whole was a huge disappointment for me.

Do you think it is worth a rewatch in some time to maybe get a different opinion of it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i have to agree with you, and i didnt even get that much hype, only from my one friend(who got me into seasonal anime) and he loves literally everything japanese. He would basically be a weaboo, except he actually has japanese blood. So obviously i didnt buy into that hype and my reaction was nowhere near as positive as his. I really dont feel like the good emotional shit of the last 2/3rds of AS can justify watching through the mediocrity(imo) of most of the first season and the first 8 episodes of the second. Im only like halfway done making my MAL, and i really have no idea how the fuck im going to score the series.
>> ARTICLE
well overhype can ruin a lot of stuff, so is normal.
It really depends, for me i know it's worth a rewatch since i liked AS a lot, but you need to be conected to the characters, or the feels wont hit home run xD.

I would recommend you to start a rewatch, and if you see yourself in some of the characters, continue watching, if you don't feel any special interaction, it's probably better to just jump to another anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you know little about Clannad, by all means go in and watch it. Hype can a real destroyer for some people, and I'm grateful I watched both seasons of Clannad with an open mind. The character designs did throw me off a bit, but it only took minutes to get over it. I'm by no means well-versed when it comes to these types of shows, but it really packed an emotional wallop with an intelligent story supported by a super strong cast of characters. Honestly, I can only think of a handful of shows that measure up in quality with Clannad. 

Speaking of White Album 2, I'm planning on watching that after I finish K-on! It's been hyped so much to me, but hopefully I can approach it without any major expectations. 
>> ARTICLE
The second half of the second season made people cry so the entire show is amazing, that's what Clannad is.
>> ARTICLE
Did someone say [90's Harlem animation?](http://reenied.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Super-Globetrotters.jpg)

I'm guessing you meant Harem? Clannad is a slice of life comedy, the MC's ok, the girls are ok. The *feels* are forever. It is no where near WA2 in character depth or scope, but if you liked any KyoAni's stuff (K-On, Air, Canaan, Haruhi) then it falls in a similar category.
>> ARTICLE
> Did someone say 90's Harlem animation?

Lol fixed
> The feels are forever

This is the part I have heard about, and the reason I want to watch the show, but can you really feel a emotional kick when all the characters are just "ok." Oh and if the characters in Clannad have half the amount of awesome interactions Kyon and haruhi do then I think Ill enjoy the show quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Kyon x Haruhi is much better imo. But you get a solid first season of interaction followed by a story going legit sad. It puts more effort than most shows. If you've seen AnoHana or Steins;Gate then you'll understand what I mean. 

KyoAni series: Haruhi > Hyouka > Clannad > K-On > the rest. To give you a rough idea of expectations.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is indeed kind of harem-y, with one male raking in chicks by helping them with their problems. It's enjoyable, pretty moe, and gives you intermediate feels. 

However, the second season is much more mature, and deals with the life of the male protagonist beyond high school, and focuses on his relationship with one girl for the most part. The second half of After Story is known as monstrous rollercoaster of emotions, and the feels level is through the roof, which is why it is considered so highly . I without a doubt recommend that you watch the series if you can put aside the art style and generic plot at first. 
>> ARTICLE
Wolf Children and Spirit Away? I feel like anime movies should be in it's own list like most lists when they say the best shows and best movies.

You can think Parasyte is a good anime and still undeserving of Top 25 status.
>> ARTICLE
True enough. Judging by the tone of his message, though, he's obviously not a fan.
>> ARTICLE
The ratings of anime that are still airing are infamously inaccurate. Raters haven't seen the whole show especially the ending (which invariably changes opinions), those people who don't rate shows they haven't completed haven't contributed their opinions and often the sites use different algorithms for determining average ratings while the show is still airing (in particular MAL only counts your rating if you have seen one fifth of the episodes that have been released). Even after long after an anime has finished airing their scores tend to gradually change over time for innumerable reasons.

I would offer the hypothesis that AnimePlanet's Crunchyroll integration is partially to blame for whey the score of Parasyte in particular is so inflated compared to other sites.

Of course that's not to say I think that it should be in a top 25 anime list (at least not so far). But what are you expecting an anime community not to have shit taste?

bleh I hate shonen too many episodes fuck Hunter x Hunter

Hummingbird masterrace!
>> ARTICLE
Hummingbird lost any respect I might of had for it when it listed Avatar as an anime unironically 
>> ARTICLE
Depends on how you define Anime.
>> ARTICLE
Anime is animation made in Japan

That's the definition- even this subreddit agrees on that as it's right in the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_everything_posted_here_must_be_anime_related)
>> ARTICLE
I think it is up to someone's interpretation. But to call one side wrong is well, wrong.
>> ARTICLE
That is *a* definition. Not *the* definition. It may be this sub's chosen definition, but it is not the only (nor widely - meaning outside the anime community) accepted one.

Merriam-Webster (somewhat of an authority on language, at least English) states this as it's definition: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime). You will notice that the emphasis is on style - one that originated in Japan - but makes no statement that it cannot be produced outside Japan.

Again, regardless of either of our opinions on the definition of anime, it's silly to say that that is the only definition.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hear any of that, but even if they did at this point, I wouldn't mind it too much. I don't see that as an anime either, but I judge the website for it's overlays, accessibility, ease of access, w/e.

That's an arbitrary reason for losing respect. It's not anime but it's close enough, who cares? 
>> ARTICLE
If I had never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime I would not believe that for a second

They are pretty far from being anime, mind I still like some of those cartoons very much on their own merits.

And there are many other reasons I dislike Hummingbird, the fact that they include non-anime is just one of them.
>> ARTICLE
Ah the old anime argument again. I take it you are in the camp that says anime = cartoons from Japan? If so, I present yet again: Le Maison Petit Cubes... (aka Tsumiki no Ie, aka Pieces of Love) an anime which you would probably say was not anime had you "never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime"...

This whole argument is ridiculous tbh, but please do go on and tell me why you think Avatar is not anime while Tsukimi no Ie is.

Terra Formars because I enjoy seeing colours, not a black screen.

All I think. The last hand full of episodes that I've watched have been uncen. I'm not sure if the early censored episodes are now uncen.
>> ARTICLE
At what episode did you notice they had stopped censoring? Cause I stopped watching after episode 2
>> ARTICLE
It was a little after that. Probably episode 3 or 4.
>> ARTICLE
dropped "world trigger" because toei can't do animation right.

 "Grisaia" because of the rushing of the last 2 episodes and picked up the VN instead.

 "Terraformers" because the first 4 episodes was just bodies dying which wan't enough to entertain me.

Lastly "Trinity seven" because i just wasn't that interested but i'm looking to pick it back up because the discussion threads look fun
>> ARTICLE
Trin 7 isnt all too amazing, but it is still interesting.  I nust hate the mcs eyes.  They piss me off
>> ARTICLE
The Trinity Seven OST is freaking AMAZING!
>> ARTICLE
I want to drop Trinity Seven because I really can't get into the characters or story, but the animation style is exactly what I enjoy and the humor makes me actually chuckle out loud. I end up catching up on it when I'm out of my other anime's to watch. I'm not that interested in what's happening, but the outright fan service makes me laugh. 
>> ARTICLE
I have been contemplating whether or not to continue watching the Grisaia anime. I haven't read the VN, but people have been saying that it is really much better. I really enjoy shows with interesting characters and great development; also enjoyed this anime. However, idk if I have 50+ hours to do so. Is it worth it? I've never read a VN before and held off the anime since ep 4
>> ARTICLE
I'll always recommend people read visual novels, it's my current favorite medium. In my opinion, grisaia is an above average VN in its genre and worth reading, if you like the genre. 

Vndb and fuwanovel are the two sites to go to for info, as well as our own /r/visualnovels
>> ARTICLE
VNs are just like regular novels in that it's easy enough to put down and pick up later. It took me weeks to find the time to read the entire thing, and it was amazing all the way through. 
>> ARTICLE
as an anime only watcher, i'd say go read the VN.
The last few episodes have felt so rushed you don't get time to get attached to the character and sympathize with their backstory before everything is suddenly over and the show moves on to the next
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. It's particularly bad in this case, since one of the strengths of the VN is how much time it spends introducing and developing the characters before even hinting at their pasts. Not having that attachment really kills the "Holy shit" factor that *should* come when you understand why they behave the way they do. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't dropped any as of yet, however I'm thinking about putting UBW on hold. Just so I can binge watch it later on.
>> ARTICLE
You guys are really gonna have to try hard to avoid spoilers. There will be a massive explosion both at the end of this cour and partway through the next cour.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it will be a problem. However I'm currently playing through the Fate route in the VN. So most likely I'll continue with the UBW route after that so spoilers might not be an issue :p

Oh god yes. And it's not like the internet isn't already a minefield of spoilers for fsn

Similar for me. I'm putting it off until I have a chance to do the VN.

Haven't dropped anything but then again I hardly picked up anything either, the only ones I'm watching right now are FSN, Parasyte, Log Horizon 2 and 2nd season of Chaika.

I've dropped:

* **Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai** - watched two eps and it seemed pretty ...bland.

* **Denki-Gai no Honya-san** - the comedy was hit and miss, for me. I like the characters so I might pick this back up later.

* **Sanzoku no Musume Ronja** - dat CG. Too childish, as well.

* **Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete** - The first (or second?) episode was pretty interesting but when I dropped it, it just seemed like a generic harem with a bit of a twist. Not enough of a twist to keep watching, tbh.

* **World Trigger** - Dropped at first episode

* **Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji** - the dude in it is a fucking asshole

* **Gugure! Kokkuri-san** - meh. 

* **Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Crystal** - For whatever reason it's just not as interesting to me as the original. I've watched about 20 episodes of the original and I only managed 7 eps of this.

* **Girlfriend (Kari)** - Not what I expected, but I'll watch it at some point if it ends up being a *good* CGDCT series.

* **Orenchi no Furo Jijou** - uneventful

edit:

>***On hold***:

* **Shingeki no Bahamut Genesis** - Don't hate me! I want to marathon this when it's done.

...I dropped a *lot*, but I'm still watching 15 shows. c:

The latest episode aside (because it was terrible), SMC is something I think mostly would only appeal to those who have that childhood nostalgia associated with the series. I'm really excited about it... most of the time... but the crappy CG doesn't endear it to anyone.
>> ARTICLE
If you fully intend to watch something after its airing, then you didn't really drop it. If anything, you put it on hold. Dropping an anime, at least the way its been defined in this community, means that you don't intend to watch it anymore, at least any time soon. 
>> ARTICLE
Aww, Kokkuri-san is pretty funny, though.

If you plan to binge watch Shingeki no Bahamut, then you haven't dropped it. You've only put it on hold :p

IMO the plot gets better, but I'm no fan of the characters so, watch those that are out atm, and decide after that :p

Its probably just not the type of show for you then. It's quality has been fairly consistent across the board, but you may be more drawn in as plot/character's develop.

True, although I hate using my on-hold list ~~because it's so full already~~ ; u ;

I've only dropped Selector Spread WIXOSS. I think I just lost interest in the story, the characters annoyed me more than usual and I don't like Yuri.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the exact same thing until I saw episode 7. Things are getting serious, you should pick it up again.

I *might* pick it up after it finishes airing but I doubt it. Tell me this, is there still Yuri in the show?

Kinda, yeah. But it's a very relevant plot element.
>> ARTICLE
Selector Spread was at the point where I was ready to drop it, and then the latest episode happened. Guess I won't be dropping this show, shit got very real
>> ARTICLE
I usually drop series when i find myself literally falling asleep when watching them.

-Trinity Seven (i dislike generic harems so there's that too)

-Girlfriend (Zzzzzz)

-Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai (Zzzz)

-Donten ni Warau (Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz)

-HisCoool! SeHa Girls (never owned a console so..)

-Sanzoku no Musume Ronja (being cg helped too, and a little too childish)

-Orenchi no Furo Jijou (I did watch Love Stage and want none of that ever again thx)

On the edge: 

-World Trigger ([ayy lmao](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2lq1q8/toeiplsstop/))

-Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (wating for that sweet plot twist that will probably never come)
>> ARTICLE
Depending on what EP you dropped Donten ni Warau I'd recommend picking it back up, but that's just me, I enjoy historical fiction. Also i'm 3 episodes behind on Yuuki Yuuna, should i catch up?
>> ARTICLE
Last episode was quite interesting, i'm curious to know where they will take it from there.

And i dropped Donten ni Warau on the second episode, disliked the main characters.
>> ARTICLE
> Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (wating for that sweet plot twist that will probably never come)

Same director as *Angel Beats!*, *Humanity Has Declined*, and *Arpeggio of Blue Steel*, so shit'll probably get real in the last 3 episodes or so.

I beg to differ. Episode 6 was by far the most cliche and uninspired out of the bunch so far. I'm just sticking to it because it's KyoAni and I'm over halfway done anyway.

Not really dropped, more like put on hold but:

-**Nanatsu no Taizai**: Already read the manga and don't have much time to watch it

-**Sanzoku no Musume Ronja**: Haven't even finished the first episode, but wanted to give it a try since the plot sounded aight


-**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso**: Read the manga as well, but don't know if I'm going to pick it up from the looks of the manga. Takes too long for MC to realize/admit his feels for the girl. And half of the time I feel like to him Piano>Girl


-**Yowamushi Pedal**: Read the manga heh


-**Kiseijuu**: Overall it's hard to watch anime where I already know what happens because of the manga. Unless the manga is like a 12/10

-**World Trigger**: First episode I dropped. Tried to read the manga and dropped that after 10 or so chapters.

Everything else is still a go!

I only legitimately dropped **Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji**. Not because I necessarily think it's bad, but the way Kyoya treats Erika, it makes me cringe and I can't get past the cringe.
>> ARTICLE
I have dropped:

* **Girlfriend (kari)**: I just can't do it. SoL with zero plot. Basically cute girls doing cute things. Not my thing. Dropped after Ep1.

* **Gundam: G no Reconguista**: The art style didn't go well with me. Even though I'm a big mecha fan, the characters just annoyed me way too much and it seems to be too kiddy for my liking. Dropped after halfway through episode 1.

* **Shingeki no Bahamaut**: This one is probably the most controversial. I've watched the first episode like 2 times trying to get into it, but for me I just can't. I don't like the characters at all. I'm not saying its bad, but I guess there are just some animes that won't click for everyone. Dropped after Ep 1.

* **Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete**: The animation for the series is just awful. The characters look so out of place that I just couldn't take it anymore and dropped it halfway through episode 2. The plot also seemed pretty boring to me and there was absolutely nothing interesting that stood out to make me look past the animation.   

* **World Trigger**: This one was one of the few shows that piqued my interest back when the fall 2014 season show list was announced. Definitely the biggest disappoint of the season for me. Everything just screamed boring to me and the monsters themselves are just laughable. Dropped after episode 2.  
>> ARTICLE
Funny, I accidentally watched the 4th episode of Bahamut first, had no idea what was going on, and loved it.
>> ARTICLE
I didnt really get hooked on the first episode of Bahamut either, you should consider watching at least episode 2. If you dont like it by then it just doesnt click for you
>> ARTICLE
Bahamaut I don't know if it is because of how stupid the MC looks or what but I could not get past episode 2 
>> ARTICLE
I totally understand! I didn't get into Shingeki until seriously an episode or two ago. Till then, I was just watching because I felt like I should like it, even though I didn't. I'm really on the edge with ushinawareta too - I keep thinking it might get better and have something interesting happen, but it keeps not happening... and I hate looking at the main girl and guy. I didn't even attempt on World Trigger after episode one. 

I am still watching Girlfriend though. I'll watch anything if it's cute enough, so cute girls doing cute things is perfect for me XD
>> ARTICLE
Shingeki didn't click with me until episode 3 or 4 when I realized how freaking smart and subtle the writing is (for an anime). It doesn't hold your hand and walk you through the show, characters develop quietly and their motivations, while obvious aren't explained to you the viewer but to the characters in the show. And everything the characters do make sense, Basically it's really well directed.
>> ARTICLE
Heh, yeah, and that's why I kept watching it. I'm still having trouble getting over Kaisar's pants though o__o
>> ARTICLE
Only thing I specifically remember dropping was World Trigger.

Checked out the first episode and it seemed really terrible.

Avoided Terra Formars since I heard about the censorship, but from the discussions it doesn't look like it'd be my cup of tea anyway.

Still watching 27 shows from the season. 80% of which are thoroughly amazing.
>> ARTICLE
>Still watching 27 shows from the season. 80% of which are thoroughly amazing  

22 shows this season make the cut as "amazing"? I can't fathom how one can be that easily amused.
>> ARTICLE
While 80% may have been a little bit of hyperbole (or might not have been since I'm excluding the 5 or so shows I fell behind on during the exam period)

* Akatsuki no Yona

* Amagi Brilliant Park

* Cross Ange

* Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken

* FS/N UBW

* Hitsugi no Chaika 2 

* Gugure! Kokkuri-san

* Parasyte

* Log Horizon 2

* Madan no Ou to Vanadis

* Nanatsu no Taizai

* Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji

* Ore Twintails ni Narimasu

* WIXOSS

* Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso

* Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis

* Shirobako

* Sword Art Online II

are all exceptional examples of their relevant genres and the shows that I haven't included because I fell behind on them were looking to be quite exceptional as well.
>> ARTICLE
There were a few shows I dropped for the reason of that I was watching a few more shows than I usually do this season, but I decided to pick most of them back up. Stuff like Okami Shoujo and Shingeki no Bahamut I stopped after the first episode, but came back to them around when the 3rd episodes came out. I also stopped watching Cross Ange at the first episode just cause I didn't think to much would happen that I would like, but people are saying it's cool so I'll probably catch up with it in a few days. Daitoshokan I have on hold cause I wanna read the VN first, which will take quite a while since I'll actually have to get somewhere in my Japanese studies.

Edit: Oh yeah, I forgot about Grisaia no Kajitsu. Although that's less so because it's kind of a rushed adaptation, but mostly because I finally finished the VN after a year so I kind of want to distance myself from it until the sequels get translated.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually really surprised with Ange. With the SEED guy involved and those ridiculous pilot suits, I was expecting a complete trainwreck. However, they manage to fit a ton into the 24 minutes they have per episode, the theme/concept is interesting, and the mecha are really cool with the motorcycle-style controls. 
>> ARTICLE
Drops: Inou-Battle, Madan no Ou to Vanadis, Garo, World Trigger  

* **Inou-Battle**: 3 episodes. Not my style of anime, I was hoping it'd be more than a school/slice of life since it had the seemly interesting powers, but it wasn't.
* **Madan no Ou to Vanadis**: 3 episodes. Too much random harem and ecchi, several questionable character decisions (like archer goes in the middle of the road to shoot enemy, prisioner with lots of freedon gets an army, general raids house alone with no protection and so on).
* **Garo the Animation**: 5 episodes. I liked the show, but it is so forgetable that I forget watching it, I don't know why. I may continue watching someday.
* **World Trigger**: 3 episodes. Kuga was too annoying with that =3= face, show didn't manage to pick my interest. 
>> ARTICLE
dropped grisaia no kajitsu because i had no clue what was happening
>> ARTICLE
The visual novel is better in the sense that it actually explains things in detail and it develops the character's backgrounds. The anime adaption cuts out 90% of all content in the VN, and that is the reason why for anime-only viewers, some things seem rushed and make no sense whatsoever.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped:
**World Trigger** : Completely unlikeable characters and just really genuinely stupid dialogue. I'm pretty new to anime but this is probably the worst show I've seen yet.

I haven't watched:
**Psycho Pass 2** : I'm just planning on marathoning it once the season is over because I'm lazy and can't watch it on Crunchyroll. Enjoyed the first season a lot though.

I'm thinking of dropping Grisia or whatever it's called because it honestly seems pretty lame and I've never played a VN before so I don't really understand the appeal. I just don't get it.

I'm tempted to drop Log Horizon 2 because it's been 1.5 seasons and literally nothing has happened. They have an interesting premise and good characters so I'll stick with it in the hopes that it lives up to the hype but right now it just seems so slow and flat. For as much as people rag on SAO at least the characters do things and give a shit about what's going on around them. Log Horizon 2 characters get stuck in a game and just sit around in a city. They don't try to get out or get stronger, they spend an entire season learning how to cook.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the need to point this out whenever people compare SAO/LH2. You may or may not be aware of it already. 

Log Horizon character's are **not** stuck in a game. They woke up in an alternate reality that mirrored the game. The game wasn't a VR like SAO, it was a keyboard and mouse game like we have today. 

Imagine going to bed and waking up in WoW/Everquest/insert fantasy MMO. It has no end to beat, and there is no obvious goal/way to go back to their reality. Its just an alternate world/reality that has some game like mechanics, but **not** an actual game (at least no more so than real life is). Personally I think stabilizing a society and proceeding to use your collective resources for the task is the best route which is exactly what they're doing.

That said this season (Log Horizon 2) has pacing and animation issues up the wazzu.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I don't think it's necessarily an important distinction, but thanks for the clarification. I don't think that the way they act given the circumstances is very reasonable (stuck in a game or in an alternate reality), particularly if they are supposed to be the "heroes" of a story and that's my biggest complaint. As a result I feel like the characters (after the set up) feel very flat. They feel (and act) a lot like NPCs would in a video game. Very static. They just don't act like human beings would given the situation. There is just no urgency.

That being said I've never seen/read the source material and maybe it's all a pacing issue with the anime. I'll stick with it and hope it becomes good. Honestly the main reason I would compare it to SAO is because everyone who talks about them compares them. SAO has it's own problems, but I've always liked that it takes a pretty real approach to human nature. People in stressful situations panic and make poor decisions. People who are trapped try to escape. People in a game act like they would in a game.
>> ARTICLE
Well its a major distinction because if they were trapped in a game there would be a way out and/or a chance of rescue. As it stands "a way out" of their reality is about as realistic a goal as flying to Alpha Centari is to us. Something that is theoretically possible, but we have neither the knowledge or resources to do it. It isn't like SAO where they have the clear goal "beat the game and be free". 
>> ARTICLE
**Denk gai no honya san**, comedy is hit or miss, bland overall. I was hoping for a character driven comedy, I got a comedy with caricatures. Dropped at episode 3

**Gogure kokkiri San** felt very sparse to me, it's pretty funny but doesn't have enough substance to hold me. Dropped at episode 3

**Ookami  shoujo** I hate every character they all are unnecessarily awful people. Plus every episode feels the exact same. Dropped at episode 4

**chaika** maybe it's because I I'm not marathoning this season but it doesn't have enough to hold my attention. Plus I never found chaika cute or endearing. It feels like I'm being retold things I already know every single episode.


Shows on the edge of being dropped:

**Inou Battle** needs to either get to the battle section of the show or add a heaping dose of Mirei.
>> ARTICLE
I just decided to drop UBW. Because Emiya is too generic of a MC.
>> ARTICLE
**Denki-gai no Honya-san** - bored  
**Grisaia no Kajitsu** - Not interested in the premise  
**Gugure! Kokkuri-san** - moe by itself isn't enough to interest me  
**HisCoool! SeHa Girls** - Seriously?  
**Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de** - Interesting premise, but it's a comedy/harem, it's not taking its own premise seriously at all so dropped.  
**Magic Kaito 1412** - Just boring.  
**Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji** - So this being what it is, I expect the girl to fall for the jerk guy. Except he's not just "a jerk", he's a blackmailing douchebag. Unless I get spoilered that she *doesn't* fall in love with him, this is staying dropped.  
**Sanzoku no Musume Ronja** - Just boring. I guess I had higher expectations from Studio Ghibli.   
**Terra Formars** - Ridiculous censorship ruins any little enjoyment that could be found from such a premise. The dumb decisions characters make didn't help either.  
**Trinity Seven** - Not interested in the premise.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped all of those shows except for Trinity Seven. Given the amount of other great shows we have this season, I can't justify spending time watching something I don't particularly like unless the season happens to be slow. 
>> ARTICLE
Grisaia no Kajitsu: The fan service is kind of dumb, to be honest (every girl getting a panty shot in the first episode kind of sets a tone), and I find none of the characters interesting. And it honestly made me kind of angry that they tried to argue that the girl who *pulled a knife on someone they just met* had traits that *totally* make up for it. Trying to cut strangers is kind of a dealbreaker in my opinion. Maybe there's something in her backstory that justifies it, but that doesn't change the fact that the way the characters reacted given the information they had at the time was just nuts.

Inou Battle: The promotional blurb made it sound interesting, but then the actual show came out...I guess I was expecting more from Trigger. The art style is kind of generic and the moments of beautiful Trigger animation are very sparse, and the otaku pandering is a bit much for me. Not that I mind a bit of otaku pandering, but it feels like the show doesn't offer anything else.
>> ARTICLE
> Otaku pandering?


>> ARTICLE
Dropped
Sora no Method - Bored me to death after episode 3
Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso - The story and characters bore me
>> ARTICLE
Yes! Sora no Method = Boring
>> ARTICLE
* Gugure! Kokkuri-san - I don't know. Nichijou is one of my favorite shows but I guess this show's humor just didn't click with me.
* Akame ga Kill! - It would not do this show Justice to keep watching.
* Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete - With a start like that I was hoping this would turn out to be the next Steins;Gate. But I couldn't find anything particularly likable about the characters and the CGI bothers me.
* Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai - Did this show get anywhere yet? The humor is great at times but the original premise kinda got lost by the wayside and I'm behind by two episodes with little motivation to continue.
* Sora no Method - It's pretty, but also not much happening for the first 5 episodes.

Honorable mention:

* Karen Senki - My golly this show is terrible but I'm doggedly keeping up every week to see if it can get any worse.

^^Still ^^Watching: ^^UBW, ^^Amagi ^^Brilliant ^^Park, ^^Chaika, ^^Twintails, ^^Bahamut
>> ARTICLE
On the topic of Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai, it's a bit boring and really shouldn't have taken half the series to get into the plot and explain the whole "Shepard" thing. I'd only recommend picking it back up if you liked the MC as it completely revolves around him deciding if he wants to help people or just be a selfish dick at this point.
>> ARTICLE
Ok thanks! I'll wait until it finishes airing then before deciding if its worth picking back up.
>> ARTICLE
Your Lie in April. This is a show I wanna watch in one sitting when I'm in the mood for that type of anime. It's really really good IMO, sucks that I have to wait but whatever.
>> ARTICLE
Not called dropping m8, it's called putting a show on hold! 
>> ARTICLE
Never said I dropped it?
>> ARTICLE
I don't drop series but put them on-hold instead and here they're:

* Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai - Didn't seem to get any better and I fell behind on the episodes.
* Donten ni Warau - I don't like Historical settings.
* Girlfriend (Kari) - Looks terrible and I don't like CGDCT series.
* Gundam: G no Reconguista - I don't even know why I started this, it looks a bit old and I didn't understand anything at all.
* Ore, Twintails no Narimasu. - Boring as fuck.
* Sora no Method - CGDCT.
* Terra Formars - Horrible censoring, I'll pick up the manga instead.
* World Trigger - Toei butchering the series, the white haired guy was annoying.

EDIT: I'm gonna assume that most downvotes comes from saying that Twintails was boring as fuck. If you disagree with me then tell me what makes it enjoyable and I would be glad to discuss it.
>> ARTICLE
If you don't really like mecha shows and generally don't know about Tomino's shows, I say wait until a few more weeks to see if you the show got better for you. It started to pick up in this week's episode and it will probably get better as it goes on.
>> ARTICLE
> Ore, Twintails no Narimasu. - Boring as fuck

Kruzy! What are you *saying*?! >:|

Mind letting us know your reasons why? Just curious. :3
>> ARTICLE
The animation is whacky. The story is stupid. The characters are annoying. 

You have a guy with a twintail fetish fighting a bunch of perverted monsters over and over. It felt like it's trying too hard to be funny and the whole subreddit treating it as the second coming of Jesus doesn't make it any better. Half-way through episode 4 I just said Fuck it, there is better shit to watch than this.
>> ARTICLE
im glad there are still sane people left without a twintailfetish
>> ARTICLE
We are a very quiet minority around here.
>> ARTICLE
There are dozens of us!
>> ARTICLE
I hate how people have the need to insult those that have different tastes than them.

Oh, you like Twintails? Clearly you have a FETISH for them. Because we live in a black and white world right?
>> ARTICLE
lol calm down and fap on some twintails

    >doesn't have a logical retort

You're right about one thing

no point to argue with a guy who likes the shittiest anime of the year + stalks my comment history hahahhaha

so saalllllllllltyyyyy ;)

whatever helps you sleep at night, twintail weeb
>> ARTICLE
In it's defense, I watch it with friends while drunk and it's amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Im starting to regret watchn these LH2 episodes, and ive jus accepted to watch Trinity seven with 0 fucks given xD
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Denki Gai,Trinity Seven, Yuki Yuna is a Hero, mainly because I didn't start them and I've been busy as hell this semester so episodes have been piling up. I might pick them back up to binge them at the end of the season. Other shows I may be dropping might be Celestial Method, Girlfriend Beta, Grisaia, and Gugure! Kokkuri-san. I think I might power through those though. The first episodes had me a little hooked.
 
>> ARTICLE
Gugure! Kokkuri-san: Loved the first episode, but with the introduction of Inugami the show just stopped being funny.
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting on a lot of episodes for shows like in search of the lost future, lord marksman, and many more 
>> ARTICLE
World Trigger: I really wanted to like it but the animation and awkward spaces drove me away. (episode 2)

Ookami Shoujo: Characters are unbearable and the girl is so stupid. (episode 3)

Akame ga Kill: I really wanted to like this one too but I hate [](/s "when they keep introducing characters only to kill them off. 3 of my favourites are dead and I just don't want to keep watching people die. Plus I really don't like Mine.") (episode 6)
>> ARTICLE
Having dropped any because I didn't pick up much to begin with. Picked up whatever was on CR minus whatever seemed to be getting bad reviews + Shingeki no Bahamut(Funi) and Fate/Stay(Hulu).

If I absolutely had to choose one to drop, it would either be Gugure (because it can be slow at times) or Sora no Method (because middle school drama).
>> ARTICLE
* Grisaia no Kajitsu - I'm reading the VN instead, it's a lot better
* Ookami Shoujo - The characters were either boring or unlikable
* Sora no Method - I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and all I got was little kids fighting about things that I didn't have enough knowledge about to care (i.e the saucer) 

>> ARTICLE
**World Trigger** Couldn't get into it because of the animation, dropped halfway through the first episode.

**Terra formars** Unappealing premise

**Girlfriend(Kari)**I want the 20min of my life i spend watching this back T-T
>> ARTICLE
Fate. Looks amazing, but I feel like watching it would spoil me or something.
>> ARTICLE
That's kind of a stupid reason to drop a show :D
Just watch it as the last show of the week or something, otherwise put it on hold and marathon it when it finished airing next summer.
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting for A week I have off, and gonna marathon everything from the universe.
>> ARTICLE
dropped world trigger. uninteresting mc's.
>> ARTICLE
Terra Formars. I imagine the manga is decent, but everything is just so poorly executed; the pacing is incredibly slow, and I have no reason to care about any of these characters. There's just no exposition.
>> ARTICLE
* **Cross Ange**: Got bored of it after 4 episodes.

* **Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai**: After 5 episodes didn't really care about this show anymore.

* **Donten ni Warau**: Couldn't even finish the 3rd episode before dropping it.

* **Garo: Honoo no Kokuin**: Dropped after 3 episodes. Wanted to know more about the prince than the main.

* **Girlfriend (Kari)**: Grew tired of it after 2 episodes.

* **Grisaia no Kajitsu**: Everything just felt too rushed so decided to just finish VN and maybe giving this another try.

* **Madan no Ou to Vanadis**: For me pacing for this show felt awful. In 6 episodes it felt like the show just went everywhere.

* **Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji**: Not my cup of tea.

* **Sora no Method**: Wasn't enjoying this show.

* **Terra Formars**: Not the best story and censored episodes.

* **Trinity Seven**: OK for a harem anime but nothing else was good about it.

* **Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete**: Was interesting at first but then just fell off from there.

* **World Trigger**: =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3=

* **Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru**: OST was nice but it didn't interest me after 4 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
World trigger. Seemed poop

Sora no method.  Got a few episodes saved, just never watched.

Akatsuki - idk.  I just havent gone back.


>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who likes World Trigger? Lmao.
>> ARTICLE
animes

Dropped:

* Grisaia no Kajitsu, because I'm going to read the VN.

* Sora no Method, because I'm going to wait for it to end.

* Karen Senki, because it's shit.

* Cross Ange, because it's shit.
>> ARTICLE
I think saying "because it's shit" is kind of a cop-out. It'd be more informative to explain what made you decide it's shit. 
>> ARTICLE
Cross ange is pretty cringy but it gets better after 3-4 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
My group of friends that never watch currently airing shows are meeting up with me to watch Cross Ange every week, solely because it's just a train wreck. 

We enjoy watching it so much that i don't know if we're still making fun of it or if we actually like it now.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat...
>> ARTICLE
I'm prepared to be downvoted but I dropped fate stay night have no idea what's going on for real but I do intend too come back to it later after I finish some other shows 
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched Fate Zero? It will make more sense if you watch it before FSN :)
>> ARTICLE
Is Fate Zero the original ?
>> ARTICLE
No, but it was created as a prequel to FSN. It explains everything about the Holy Grail War and the motivations of some of the characters in FSN :)
>> ARTICLE
If you're interested in the world, I recommend picking up the visual novel. Unlimited Blade Works is the second route, so you're kind of supposed to know what's going on, and it's basically just eye-candy for us VN readers. The first route of the visual novel will explain the relevant mechanics of the Type-Moon universe, although there's plenty that it doesn't go over since they're more relevant in Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai, and others.
>> ARTICLE
**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso-** Disliked the female lead and how aggressive/pushy she was. Also found it somewhat boring even though I enjoyed the music. 

**World Trigger-** hated the =3 face and the animation didn't leave much to be desired.

**Denki-Gai no Honya-san-** The comedy fell flat for me. Felt like the characters were trying too hard to be crude and it didn't seem fitting at all. 

**Girlfriend (Kari)-**  Cute girls doing cute things is simply not enough.

**Ore, Twintails no Narimasu-** Didn't find it funny which takes away its biggest strength. 

**Sora no method-** Not a fan of little kid drama. The start was also quite boring and uneventful. 


 
>> ARTICLE
> CGDCT 

Thank you ! Finally found someone who dropped Sora no Method. That show was literally a sleeping pill
>> ARTICLE
I'm putting Log Horizon on hold for the moment - I'm not a huge fan of the art and the story seems a bit jumbled and rushed (after 5 episodes)


>> ARTICLE
I'm also on the same boat as you. Fit me it just seems soooo boring. I find Akatsuki's not even an interesting character and the dialogue is so bland, repetitive and cliche. There's very little I find impressive about this series.
>> ARTICLE
The only show I've dropped with no intention of picking it up again later is **Karen Senki**. Unless you count **Akame ga Kill** since it's still airing from last season.

I'm waiting on more episodes to binge through for **Terra Formars**, **Selector Infected WIXOSS** and **Ronja the Robber's Daughter**.
>> ARTICLE
I feel pretty good, of 15 shows I only dropped 3. 

* Girlfriend: I was never that much into it, and dropped it in the first episode when that German/French girl started talking in that horrible horrible excuse for language. It's probably the shallowest reason I've ever had to drop an anime, but like I said, I was never that much into it so I would've probably dropped it for whatever other reason later on. 

* Inou Battle Wa Nichijou: Another one I was never that much into. Three episode rule, felt pretty generic and genuinely uninteresting. Dropped. 

*  Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai: This one was pretty much the same. Watched the first two episodes. Way too generic and uninteresting. Dropped. 

I also have Shirobako and Log Horizon 2 kinda sorta on hold (nothing especially wrong with them, I just don't feel like watching them right now).  

Other than that I'm really up to date with the rest of my list, so I'm happy. 
>> ARTICLE
Well at first I would have agreed with you about Inou Battle but what really sets it apart from the other generic harems is the MC.  Andou is a harem MC that is actually intelligent and knows what to say at the right times. 
>> ARTICLE
His only personality is that he is nice to the girls and helps them out when they are going through some hard times. Just like every harem MC.  Ohh and he's chuuni.   
>> ARTICLE
Can't say I really noticed it, man... To me he was pretty average. 
>> ARTICLE
It started of quite generic, but because I know that Trigger studios produced some great stuff before (Kill la Kill), I gave it a chance, and I feel like it's picking up pace. It's still not amazing, but I do enjoy watching it every week.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus Fuck, how many of these threads do we need?

Well, notable drops people hate me for:
Shirobako
Twintails
Inou Battle
Trinity Seven
>> ARTICLE
I also dropped Shiroback, but also tune in from time to time to check the episodes.

It's realistic in a sense where people fuck up and drop their issues on one another, but again it keeps the light tone and resolving them with an optimistic outlook.
>> ARTICLE
Grisaia no Kajitsu - I hated all of the characters except Michiru. i get the feeling i wouldn't like the VN either. 

Akame ga Kill -read the manga and it was a pretty meh shonen. The main characters die before I even get a chance to like them.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso - Kaori's eyes really bother me. But no, I'm gonna watch it later by marathoning it.

Terraformars - gonna marathon it later. 

Twintails - I only have so much time in the day and that's not enough time for twintails

I'm kinda freaking out right now.

We're back, it's as if those 7 years never happened and the show just continued.  If it keeps going strong I think this will easily be AoTS for me, hell it'll probably be AotY as well.  Its contemplative beauty is just so stunning.  

And boy do I love that new op.
>> ARTICLE
Having finished the first series, I find it wonderful that they began this season with a depiction of mushi as a benign (perhaps neutral) preternatural force - the first season didn't paint as kind a picture of them in the beginning. 
>> ARTICLE
I could be wrong but doesn't Ginko mention that most of the mushi are rather harmless.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Tundranocaps gave a good example above. They are not malicious. They're like bacteria, neutral and simply living like anything else. They can just cause bad stuff to happen.
>> ARTICLE
Well, he's a Mushishi, he's a doctor. He usually comes around when things go wrong, so it makes sense most of the episodes he's in are with "harmful" Mushishi.

Even if they're harmful, they're still "neutral" in the same way a wave can lap at your feet or be a tsunami.

I LOVE the new opening! I was expecting Ally Kerr again. What a pleasant surprise! (Shiver by Lucy Rose if anybody was wondering.)

I totally didn't tear up or anything. That would never happen. No sir.

It's back, and I couldn't be any more pleased.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who can easily change their mind about an anime by music alone, I feel like I have to watch s1 now because that song is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
S1 op was amazing as well. It's called (I believe) "The Sore Feet Song."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBBFDb0hC4Y&feature=kp
>> ARTICLE
The song at the beginning was Shiver by Lucy Rose. It says it in the opening near the end.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, I was looking in the end credits! Thanks!

Also here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o84y-5-cO0) to the full song. 
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't tell if the visuals in the OP were real or fake, that shit was Makoto Shinkai level
>> ARTICLE
Right? I was staring so hard to try and figure it out. I'm still not sure. If it was fake, it was the realest fake scene ever.
>> ARTICLE
That music video is stunning.  Fits the song so well.
>> ARTICLE
I just realized the music video tells the story of a guy that lost his girl.

That's like one-third of the outcomes in this show.
>> ARTICLE
I went coma after the Opening. The music was so beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Seven years later, and we are back in business, baby. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow. I was hyped for Jojo and it really got my blood boiling because of the sheer awesome. Decided I'd watch Mushishi as a way to calm myself down and holy shit did it work.

Everything from the opening onward was just designed to put me at complete ease. The most intense scene was when the kid tripped and caught himself or when they chased him for a few seconds. 

I used to watch the first season on Funimation channel at like 8:00 in the morning before school started because it was an amazing way to wake up. I welcome these new episodes with open arms.
>> ARTICLE
Same. I'll eventually rewatch the first season with subs, but I watched the dub on TV back in high school, so it's weird hearing the original voice for Ginko.
>> ARTICLE
Ya, that's the boat I'm on, though I only watched Mushishi about six months ago. Ginko's voice just sounds *wrong* to me. I...I might actually have to wait until this season gets dubbed before I finish it.
>> ARTICLE
You had a funimation channel?  Jealous.
>> ARTICLE
[I love my life so much right now.](http://i.imgur.com/R604gyN.gif) It really doesn't get any better than this. All aboard the *Mushishi* hype-train! Choo choo motherfucker!

Also, for those of you who're trying to add Zoku Shou to your watching list on MAL but it won't let you, hopefully the mods at MAL will push the update I made to the airing date - right now, it says the air date is April 5th, even though it already aired.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call it a hype-train, more like a nice relaxing hype sail boat.
>> ARTICLE
It let me add it, so I'm not sure why it wont let you.
>> ARTICLE
It won't let you move it to "Watching" from your anime list page if it's in "Planned". You can get around it if you go to the series page and change it manually to watching. However, it'll randomly change it back to your planned list sometime later - that's what I did last night, and this morning it got moved back to my "Planned" list. I just moved it back to watching; hopefully, it'll stick this time.
>> ARTICLE
I had it in my "Planned" list and still let me move it even though it says "not yet aired"
>> ARTICLE
Ah. I didn't have it in my plan to watch so that's probably why.

Yeah, I binged the last 10 episodes + OVA yesterday.  I'm running on three hours' sleep but I feel great!  Guess I got some Kouki flowin' through me ;)

Who would of thought mushi like to drink? I'm heavily considering going to grab so sake and re-watch this episode in the right state of mind and hope to god I see something cool, fingers crossed, lol.
>> ARTICLE
Mushi are always a bit Shinto, and all gods partake of Sake.  Monogatari references this idea as well, both back in bake with Senjou drinking a bit of sake to commune with her crab god, and in the most reason season with Nadeko getting offered sake by Kaiki.  There was also the sake cup back in Mushishi season 1 ep 1
>> ARTICLE
Remember it needs a golden glow ;)
>> ARTICLE
Your so right....anyone know how to get in contact with Rokusuke? lol
>> ARTICLE
That was everything I hoped it would be. Same as always, magical.
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful OP :3 Yes, sometimes it pays to take an already existing song, where you know what you're going to get, and can fit it to the show.

This was a little piece of real magic, wasn't it? I like how in some episodes, and this is hardly the first, Ginko is just some wanderer wandering through someone else's narrative. The place where the real and the fantastical intersect.

Also, copy of a copy, and yet striving to be real on its own merits, is what the son's sake is.

We're in for some loooong weeks boys.

Damn time

We must fill the void with a dozen other shows, stay strong!

Man, I missed this show. That new OP was heaven. It looks like this could be just as good as last season if this episode's any indicator.
>> ARTICLE
SO LONG HAVE I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS, AND DAMN IT WAS WORTH IT

Definitely loved this episode. The music and storytelling - mmmmmmmm. Waiting a week for the next episode will be terrible...

Definitely got shivers this episode. Very comfy.

That was a great first episode. The ost and OP were great as always , I missed this show so much.

i have so many shows to catch up on, i have to catch up on some of last seasons shows and i have to catch up on jojo's prequel and mushishi prequel im in for a week of marathoning

I'm just going to hold off on Jojo for now, maybe over summer.
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend you put space in between Mushishi because it is a bad show to marathon. Watch 2-3 per sitting tops or at least an episode of something else in between every couple
>> ARTICLE
It's the perfect one-before-bedtime anime.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, it calms you while lots of anime will either get you pumped up or emotional
>> ARTICLE
probably the AOTS just by the first episode, head and shoulders above any other anime released so far
>> ARTICLE
and torso, basin, legs... the rest are at his feet, as literally as possible.

>> ARTICLE
Finally out!
>> ARTICLE
Hooray, finally got to finish the episode!  Great as expected, beautiful art, music, and story as always.  Great start to my first season, and I loved that Isaza cameo!
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know how much of the manga the first season covered?
>> ARTICLE
They covered about 5, and a little bit of 6, of the 10 volumes. The OVA was separate from the manga, so we're more or less looking at the same pacing as the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, it's still Mushishi. Artsy, chill, and still beautiful. One thing that I noticed that felt strange is that certain movements felt like they were really dragged out. Like a guy turning over his shoulder would take a full 2 seconds. But hey, I'm happy to see this airing again.
>> ARTICLE
damn, we get this AND stardust crusaders at the same time, this is gonna be a good season
>> ARTICLE
I've waited way too long for this. Just as perfect as I remember it.
>> ARTICLE
The first episode was pleasant as always, can't wait for more.  

Mushishi is the best kind of show. Beautiful, thought provoking, incredibly relaxing yet never boring and always keeping me deeply interested and attentive of what is happening. Such an absolute joy to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I love the art style, the way the world is put together and how people act.  I was so sad when Mushi ended the first time, now it is back!!!
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if they will continue where the OVA left off, with Ginko bringing Tanyu the shard. I hope so, can't get enough of that ship.
>> ARTICLE
My ears are so hard for the narrations.   
>> ARTICLE
A relaxing episode about sake. A nice way to reintroduce the show before delving into the bitter-sweet stories.

I also liked how this episode adds to the mushi mythos.
>> ARTICLE
Very great episode imo.

I didn't watch the OVA, is that a problem or not?
>> ARTICLE
Well since the show is episodic and none of the episodes tell the same story, the OVA is just like a regular episode that's twice as long. No reason not to watch it!
>> ARTICLE
You can watch this first, but I suggest watching the OVA soon.  It's really good IMO.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I watched the OVA to get re-acquainted with the series, it's been a while since I've watched the first season.
>> ARTICLE
I am so glad I held off watching the first season of Mushishi until a couple months ago. Even then the wait was unbearable. Its so good to be back! I can't wait for a certain ship to set sail....get it Gin!!
>> ARTICLE
It's been awhile, but it's finally back! And it started just as good as the original! I love the intro song, was pleasantly surprised by it. The art is fantastic as usual. This is already looking to be AoTS for me! 
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people are saying that in this thread which I think is hilarious because most of this season's shows haven't aired yet!  But I understand the excitement, I'm excited too!
>> ARTICLE
Haha, very true. I guess I should at least give other shows a chance first!  This one just seems really promising! 
>> ARTICLE
Such a relaxing show. A great way to end the work week.
>> ARTICLE
I love that this show is back, I watched the first season last year so I'm not dealing with that 7 year wait but it's still awesome having more episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Should i watch the prequel before i start this? is that important?
>> ARTICLE
Not really, the episodes are pretty much all one offs. That being said, I highly recommend you do watch it since it is such a great show. Also there are a few recurring characters who you won't recognize unless you watched the first season.
>> ARTICLE
So it's like Space Dandy then?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
also mushishi is actually a good show 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
True. I would have said while Space Dandy is good. Mushishi is objectively amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily. There are some episodes in this series that will relate, but everything you'd need to know would be in the preface to each episode, or in the OVA if you watch that.
>> ARTICLE
I see, thank you.
>> ARTICLE
You should always watch shows in release order.

In my experience it's very rare to have a previous season that's skippable and not really worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but release order doesn't necessarily mean chronological.
>> ARTICLE
chronological is not necessarily the order you should watch it.
>> ARTICLE
True, but it is often the way it will make sense.
>> ARTICLE
if it didn't make sense in release order than there would never be prequels made

something has to stand on its own enough for people to like it before you start trying to fit more non-chronological stories in
>> ARTICLE
A lot of shows that mess with chronological ordering of events end up being better for it. Suzumiya TV airing is much better then the Bluray, or Bacanno is all over the place and is better for it.

So, stick with the release order, it can have nice surprises and doesn't spoil things.
>> ARTICLE
The only exceptions I can think of are remakes that fix the problems of the older series, like the new JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders and the Hunter x Hunter reboot.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking of White Album 2 and the Fate/Stay Night anime.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Mushishi is known for being an extremely episodic series. You should probably watch the [original series](http://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi) to get a better appreciation for the Mushishi universe, but there isn't a whole lot you need to know. From what I recall, some important things include Ginko's backstory and what the "Kouki" is.
>> ARTICLE
OK. I'll watch the prequel and return next week then.
>> ARTICLE
Try not to marathon it, put some space between the episodes otherwise you won't be able to fully appreciate it. I would recommend 2-3 per sitting tops or at least watching something in between
>> ARTICLE
don't marathon this show... you are going to enjoy it better if you take your time to watch it, try watching 1 episode per day, this is one of the most relaxing shows ever and you will get a feeling of comfiness every time you watch an episode. If you marathon this you will probably no appreciate it that much as if you'd take your time to watch it

>Should i watch the prequel before i start this?

Yes

>is that important?

No

Then I will start the prequel.

A great opening episode for the new series! Glad they didn't start on one of their more depressing episodes. They're easing us in to it.

By the way, does anyone know what "zoku shou" means?
>> ARTICLE
Do I need to watch S1 to watch S2? I have the first season DL'd but it's taking me forever to watch. Mushishi doesn't really lend itself to marathoning.
>> ARTICLE
Finally...Everything I hoped it to be.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god so I totally on a whim marathoned the first season of Mushishi yesterday because a friend recommended it to me a couple weeks ago. I looked up stuff on MAL and found out about the new season today and saw when it was airing... april... fifth? holy shit that was yesterday! I was so sad when it was over, but now I can just happily continue the amazing journey! This is seriously one of the best shows and I'm so excited for whats to come. And it looks like this season is gonna hold up to the last very well.

Almost the entire series is the same. If I remember right, there is one part that spans two episodes, or maybe it's just that one thing comes up again in a second episode. But yeah, if you didn't like the first few episodes, you wouldn't like any of them, damn near nothing changes.

I can't fathom /r/anime's obsession with it, truly. I get that it's well animated, and well arranged, and I enjoyed watching it, but it just seems uninspired, and the overall setting seems poorly thought out (Mushi seem to have no consistent rules to them, like magic in the worst way). It's ***just*** a series of simple stories with mushi made up to create conflict.
>> ARTICLE
>Mushi seem to have no consistent rules to them, like magic in the worst way

I think it's magic in the best way. When magic has strict rules, it doesn't feel like magic to me. I like how the mushi are this drifting force that subtly influence life in various ways. I think it strikes a good balance between something recognizable and something humans can never truly grasp.
>> ARTICLE
>I can't fathom /r/anime[1] 's obsession with it, truly.

Is it so hard to realize that /r/anime has 150k subs and different people like different things? 

For example I can never in my life figure out how seasonal shounens are getting such a huge following even though most of them are seeping shitty writing and have glaring problems. I don't really like that kind of entertainment. However, Mushishi is objectively a great show. Doesn't mean everyone has to like it or even tolerate it though. I say objectively, because I haven't seen anyone saying that the show is bad and backing up their statement with some analysis of why it is like that. Some people find it boring, some people hate episodic nature, but that's just a personal preference. The show explores interesting themes, the characters are quite well written and the stories are well built. Also, if I wanted to clear your confusion about Mushi being uninspired, I'd have to write way more than I am willing to do at this time, but keep in mind that it's not a show about mushi, it's a show about humans and mushi are just a tool. Btw, I find Mushi to be really awesome and the things they do are quite original, don't you agree? They are way more interesting than another alien creature trying to conquer the world or another bad guy who is bad because some arbitrary reasons. 

But that's what I enjoy. I enjoy the lack of moral extremes, I love the exploration of human nature, I revel in adventures and fancy different characters. Mushishi is a selection of simple stories telling way more than most shows. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. Again, I enjoyed it, but I don't understand why anyone thinks it's *literally* the best anime ever made, which an opinion many people here express fervently.
>> ARTICLE
Well, probably because it's the best for them. And I don't blame them. Mushishi is in my top 10 too. And it's far from the worst show to admire. I've seen around 200 different shows and Mushishi is something that stands out to me. Very few shows do things as well as this. Maybe it's not on the same level as good literature, but in anime world it's one of the highlights. Everyone has personal criteria on which they rate their consumed media. 

EDIT: Also last season was really crappy(I don't think any of the shows passed 7/10 for me). I am genuinely excited for some good shows. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a personal favorite. I can easily imagine myself watching the whole series every few years, verry little shows get two or more watches from me.

As for why, it has a great universe to explore, very calm tone (not a lot of shows can do this), is not in your face but you pick up stuff as you go. A really well done slice of life in an alternate universe.

It's the closest I've seen to a really good book in anime media. Now, I'm not trying to be a troll here, but just like a book you need to not have ADD for this series, which is a problem in today world since we are all sensitized to everything being NOW (I notice ADD in myself from time to time, hard to get rid of...)
>> ARTICLE
It stays episodic, I heard someone once say it was "bedtime stories." That's a good description, they're just interesting stories.  You do learn a bit about Ginko and there are a few recurring characters.
>> ARTICLE
Just started Kokoro connect without knowing anything at all about it (besides that masturbation gif that gets posted everywhere). Only seen the first episode so far, but it seems interesting. I hope it does it's supernatural theme better than Henneko.
>> ARTICLE
Like others have said, I thought the show had some good ideas, but it was just good, nothing special. I just thought the anime didn't really hold its own and became a bit to focused on the romance side of things, but it seems that for whatever reason people are jumping on this show. At leas the show was good enough to persuade me to read the lite novels, which are actually really good. 
>> ARTICLE
It really steps up from it's first episode. Character development was done right in this anime which is what I cannot say about some others.

However, I have not been able to watch the Final Four episodes. The legal trouble or whatever Kokoro Connect got into made it impossible to view it. I have no idea how to see it for myself. I went to Youtube and see a clip that made me realize that the anime had a wonderful ending.

Recommended, keep on viewing, like the rest of us on team masturbation.
>> ARTICLE
I've just looked up that masturbation gif, and I'm now very eager that to watch that show....this would be strange out of context wouldn't it.

I just watched that recently, I seriously don't understand Inaba's popularity, nothing about her really stands out to me.
>> ARTICLE
how far in did you get?
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first season, gonna get around to watching the other episodes soon.
>> ARTICLE
When that show was airing it felt like a rather sizable percentage of people (myself included) were seriously disappointed and unhappy with that show, but it seems lately that show has gotten terrifically popular for some reason. Was there some kind of blogger or something gushing over it?
>> ARTICLE
I watched it for the first time a few days ago and I definitely agree. The character development was really whack and the romance was lame. Too many people deciding they love one another out of nowhere. Also, [spoilers](/s "seriously the worst character conflict that comes up *more than once* is Iori acting like a different person than what she feels she really is?? It felt so over dramatized and the entire time I was watching it I couldn't help but think, 'That's your problem... really... that's it?'")
>> ARTICLE
I watched it after seeing a few of the gifs.

I went in not expecting anything good, but was blown away; the character development was better than anything I had seen before.

What was disappointing, can I ask?
>> ARTICLE
I picked it up when [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/21stwc/im_rewatching_kokoro_connect_and_this_scene/) thread popped up. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched it recently and really enjoyed it. Especially after the last 4 special episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I think the "Michi Random" arc was the weakest part of the story.  It had the least interesting "phenomenon," and it made Iori the focus, for the third time - completely undermining her character in the process.  I would've been happier with the show if those episodes never existed.
>> ARTICLE
I am still in two minds about the whole Michi thing, as I was also completely shocked how the writers messed with her character, it was really melodramatic and completely pointless. The "phenomenon" was only ever good due to the scenes with Inaba IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
On the other hand.

[Kokoro Connect Michi Random spoilers](/s "It features Inaba winning at the end which is such a better ending.")

Meh.  I still maintain that Yui was the "best girl" in the series, despite her clear B-team pairing.

I started and completed **[One Outs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5040/One_Outs)** this week. It was a brilliant series. **8/10** I highly recommend it.

I as welll started **[Texhnolyze](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26/Texhnolyze)** and **[Slam Dunk](http://myanimelist.net/anime/170/Slam_Dunk)** today. I hope great things from these.

**Edit:**

I forgot about **[Uchouten Kazoku](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=17909)**. I finished it as well this week.

It was something rather unique and was written by the [same guy](http://myanimelist.net/people/13775/Morimi_Tomihiko) who made [The Tatami Galaxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei). I recommend it as well.

I have started technolyze like 15 times, but never finish the first episode. There is no good reason for it, i should really get off my ass and finish it.

I'm watching The Eccentric Family and it is breathtakingly beautiful. I love animes that have the same feeling and Tomihiko Morimi is one of my favorite writers. I would love him even better once my Japanese reading gets better.

I liked Slam Dunk. But I probably have nostalgia goggles on because I used to watch it with my dad when I was still in primary school.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion (11/26)**  
Pretty surprised that I like it. I'm not a fan of mecha or "old" shows, but still, I'm not bored at all watching this.  
So far, it's kinda "angel of the week" episodes, but there's some hints that something bigger is gonna happen.  
For all the complaints I heard about Shinji, I find him okay as a character, not as whiny as people make him to be. (Maybe it's because I've seen Accel world..)  

**Sakasama no Patema (1/1)**  
I loved it. It's just .. beautiful. 
The story kept surprising me. And while I was slightly confused at the end, I managed, thanks to this subreddit/MAL forums, to understand everything.  
The only big flaw is the characters, mostly the bad guy, who is just.. bad. But that's understandable since the movie isn't that long.  
**9/10**
>> ARTICLE
I think one of the main reason Eva holds up so well is it had pretty amazing animation quality for it's time. It definitely looks amazing compared to most shows of the same era.
>> ARTICLE
While watching the series, I didn't find Shinji to be very whiny (or at least not too much. There were some parts where he expresses how much he dislikes piloting an Eva, but overall he wasn't too bad). But in the movie (End of Evangelion), I hated him so much. If I were a character in that movie, I would have slapped him in the face so hard.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like out of context, yes. But after the last episodes of NGE, he couldn't really be expected to do much.
>> ARTICLE
Shinji is by no means a *bad* character. He is a very well written one, but that doesn't count for people saying they don't like him. That's only based on his appearance. 

In terms of *real* character, Shinji is by far one of the strongest (best written etc.).
>> ARTICLE
I think he is a really well written character I still do not like him, (because of his actions later on in the series and in 3.33) 
>> ARTICLE
I binge-watched both *Psycho-Pass* and *Fate/Zero.*I was (pleasantly) surprised that *Psycho-Pass* lived up to the hype.  Being honest, when a series is much-ballyhooed, I usually watch it with undue criticism.  Yet, with *Psycho-Pass,* my only annoyance was the sound effect used when what appear to be spent shotgun shells are cast onto a hard surface - it sounded like brass casings.  That's it.*Fate/Zero* was a bit more within my preferred genres.  I realize it's a prequel, and it *has* to end in such a way that ties it to the existing material, but I felt the second season failed to deliver on the promise of the first in terms of storytelling.  It's still good, but I think it's weaker.
>> ARTICLE
Oui, the second season of Fate/Zero was unfortunately bridled to the beginning of Fate/Stay Night. The story had to pave it's way to set up the beginning of FSN and as a result, it suffered. 

Admittedly, I read the FSN visual novel post F/Z and watched the anime because I was hoping for F/Z levels of brilliance. 
>> ARTICLE
**Log Horizon S1 (completed)**

I started watching this after seeing one too many Akatsuki gifs and deciding that I needed to see her in action. My full writeup on this show ended up being over 1500 words long, so I'll just sum it up more briefly here.

Log Horizon was a pretty great story, and it really nails quite a few things that allow it to do its job. For one, its execution-of-concept is *spot* on. It aims to be a story taking place in a vast MMORPG world, and it never lets the viewer forget that. The world has politics, it has NPCs and inhabitents, it has problems and crime, it has class issues, culture, and cultural differences, it has social dynamics, it has an economy, and more. Although not all of this is explored in any depth, it's all *there*, and the viewer sees it and knows something about it.

On top of this, names of very distant, unvisited cities, of powerful guilds in other lands to the west and north, and rumors about what's going on in these places come up every few episodes. You're always aware of just how much there is in this world beyond what you see and know, making the world feel vast and unknown.

The character work was, in my opinion, appropriate for the show, but I can see some viewers not liking how it was done. To go along with the huge world they created, they gave us an equally huge cast. This naturally means that most characters aren't particularly deep or developed as individuals, but Log Horizon makes sure they're strong as a unit. The show uses this well by dividing up its cast into parties (sound familiar, MMO players?) and telling big, multi-faceted story arcs with lots of parallel events going on in different places, all working toward a goal. They also managed inter-personal sub-plots all over the place on top of this, including up to four distinct romantic subarcs, mentor/student relationships, developing friendships and bonds of trust, and more. Some of it was really touching and realistic, too.

The show's weaknesses mainly come down to one thing: Cliches. Log Horizon is full of them. Bad guys look ugly and evil and are bad because they're bad, the show severely overuses recurring gags in its first third or so (but does tone this down appropriately later), and while its world-building is great, its method of exposition was ham-handed. The whole "monologue to the viewer through your thoughts" thing was used constantly. Log Horizon should take a lesson or two from Hitsugi no Chaika, a show that knows how to do exposition if nothing else.

Animation, artwork, and soundtrack are not stand-out, but of high quality throughout and definitely do their jobs, the OP is as ridiculously infectious as the fanbase would have you think, and the glasses sheen is real.

If you're okay with a load of cliches and occasionally repetitive, predictable humor in exchange for one of the most vibrant worlds you'll find and a sense of wonder and adventure with a great group of people, give the database a shot.

**Humanity Has Declined (5/12)**

I don't have much to say about this show just yet, mainly because it does absolutely no explicit exposition. It really just dumps you in this world as seen through the eyes of our cynical, sarcastic nameless protagonist and has her solving interesting but bizarre problems. The world's state is very, very slowly coming into focus as bits and pieces of information are given to the viewer as time passes.

The artwork is extremely distinct and the color palette is vibrant and gorgeous, it has my [favorite ED in recent memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13w2SGFz0c), and the protagonist is just a fantastic, quick-witted character who reminds me a lot of Kyon from Haruhi Suzumiya or Araragi from Monogatari. I've heard that the show contains a lot of social commentary, but unfortunately I'm horrifically uncultured in general, so this is not something I'm noticing.

Jintai is great to pick up alongside other series because it so far has a very even, purposeful pace. It's told in 2-episode arcs that are pretty disjoint from each other, so you can easily squeeze in an arc when you have 40 minutes to spare and come back later.

I actually do recommend this series to anyone reading for much the same reason I'd recommend Monogatari to anyone: I've never seen anything else like it, and if it's your kind of thing, it's a real treat.

> favorite ED in recent memory

Same singer (band?) did the ED for [Haibane Renmei, "Blue Flow"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fo2myUedaU). [Masumi Ito](http://myanimelist.net/people/8635/Ito_Masumi) looks like the real life version of Uiharu from the Raildex series. EDIT: Wow, she also the did music for Kyoukai no Kanata, she's got quite the resume.

[Natsume Yuujinchou San](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10379/Natsume_Yuujinchou_San)

**Sankarea - 8/10:** Finished this one after starting it last week and all the time I had this one spoiler (Which I'm not even sure is true) in my mind. I found it overall pretty good and really liked Rea although her father was really creepy. I've added the Manga to my PTR list and I hope I'll get to it before forgetting the series.

**Yosuga no Sora:** Next on my list was this show which picked my interest after I saw it under the "Heavy incest" category on the recommendation wiki. I've barely finished the 5th episode and I think it's decent so far. 
>> ARTICLE
I definitely recommend reading through the manga for Sankarea. Just about everything picks up and the English translation only has something like six chapters left.

**White Album 2** (1-6/12)
I'm liking the romantic tension in this show. After watching a good number of drama romance animes, this is the first one where I feel the characters are being the most realistic with their emotions. It is honestly turning into my favorite romance anime. 

**Casshern Sins** (9-11/24)
I started watching this a while ago because I really like the setting the show takes place in, but the pacing of the story was really slow so I put it on hold. Picked it back up and it's still really hard for me to keep up with it. On the other hand, the action is great, and Cassherns relationships with other characters also feel very real.

**Angel Beats!** (1-5/13) - Started this show on recommendation from friends and colleagues on the internet, enjoying it quite a lot. The ending to the Iwasawa episode made me sad.

**Hidamari Sketch x365** (1-4/13) - Started Hidamari's second season on the side, still love Miyako, still love Hiro.

**Spice and Wolf II** (Complete) - Wow. Just. Wow. I loved the second season of S&W so much. I had watched the first season the week before and marathoned Season 2 while a friend was away. Now, left to appreciate what I've watched and wallow in the sadness of no Season 3.

> Now, left to appreciate what I've watched and wallow in the sadness of no Season 3.

I'll offer the same advice given to me: go read the light novels! They're quite good as well. I'm just now on the final one and it's been a great ride even after finishing the anime months ago.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching Oregairu (8/13) and I'm surprised, why this show is so hyped around here. I consider the writing and the characters sub-par and the author doesn't hide the fact very well, that this is actually a RomCom, even with some people here telling me that there's no RomCom. 
>> ARTICLE
It's probably because Hachiman and Yukino their interactions alone made me really like the series. It has a decent social commentary but I find Haciman to be a good MC, he isn't afraid to speak his mind nor is  he is afraid to share his views on the society(as twisted they may be). How much you enjoy a Romance is really how much you like the characters, Hachiman is a really likable MC so I can see the hype centered around it. He also gives some pretty decent monologues, although truth to be told there hasn't been much romance. Guess we have to wait for S2. 
>> ARTICLE
I definitely agree with you on that one. A lot of people here act like it's a super sophisticated social commentary, but it's not too much more than a romantic comedy with harem and satire elements. While it's not bad by any means, it shouldn't really stand out, especially as far as characters go.

**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha (13/13)**

**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's (13/13)**

**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS(4/26)**

I like the series so far, but I'm a sucker for Magitek and lasers. I haven't seen much magical girl anime, so I can't really compare this to the genre as a whole, but it is certainly different than what I've seen so far. Also, Fate is absolutely adorable.

**Cardcaptor Sakura (70/70)**

Madoka Magica aside, my only other foray into the magical girl genre ended in a strange way. The plot resolved nicely, and it was nice seeing Sakura grow a little more confident in her abilities. I was not happy that they ended Sakura's romantic subplot without any actual resolution, though. Hopefully the second movie will give me the ending I was hoping for.

**Gungrave (1/26)**

That is a terrible dub.

**Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (26/26)**

That was everything I never knew I wanted. Lots of extremely muscular men named after classic rock bands killing vampires with weaponized sunlight.

**Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders (14/24)**

Same as above, but with the added bonus of Stands. Stands so far have been so interesting and original, it's great seeing what they'll do next.

[LotGH Spoilers](/s "One thing that annoyed me about the Isenhorn Republic was that even though they supported democracy, their two leaders were chosen by a very small number of people, they clearly abused of Nepotism, placing both Yang's wife and son on those positions and Frederica was clearly military when she was appointed to the position, even though they said they shouldn't place someone from the military there. </end of rant>")

The story telling is very engrossing, the characters and their VA's have huge chemistry and the pacing is fucking fantastic.

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann** (27/27)


I just want to start of by saying I've always said Cowboy Bebop was the best anime ever and considered it my favorite of all time. Gurren Lagann beat it by a longshot.


I've never seen such an epic, uplifting, entertaining, and amazing thing in my whole life. You don't just watch Gurren Lagann: you experience it. Not only did I enjoy it immensely, I also feel extremely inspired to strive to be a more confident person. It just does that to you.


All of the characters were memorable, and the protagonists were super likeable. I loved watching the Team Dai-Gurren operate, and I loved watching them win battles. 


Not only that, but for the first time in my life, a work of fiction made me cry. Episode 26, when [spoiler](/s "Kamina reappears. His death hit me surprisingly hard. I saw Episode 8 at night, and I spent the entire day after feeling really bummed out because of it. No character death has affected me like that before.")


And that final battle? That had to be hands down the most epic thing I've ever witnessed. Seriously, it blew my mind.


The show's funny, epic, ridiculous, inspiring, stylish, emotional, manly, entertaining, and about a billion other positive adjectives. It is, without a doubt, my favorite anime of all time. It just upsets me because I'm not aware of anything that can come close to topping it. It's been several days since I finished it, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It's that good. Ten outta ten.


(Oh, and I had a hard time taking Lordgenome seriously. He was a badass, but... he had the same voice as Jelly Jiggler from Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo. I grew up with that show, so I couldn't unhear that goofball Jelly Jiggler's voice.)


**Baccano!** (2/16)


I honestly knew next to nothing about Baccano! going into it, other than it's supposed to be good.


So far, I'm really liking it. Two episodes isn't really enough to form a solid opinion on it yet, but it's very enjoyable nonetheless. I like the characters a lot, especially Isaac and Miria. I'm not totally sure what's happening, but I'm guessing it solidifies a little later. 


And I need to make a mental note on downloading the theme song, cause that's a damn good tune. 

>> ARTICLE
Have you seen the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann movies yet? The second one really makes the final battle from the series pale in comparison. 
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind with Baccano that even though it jumps between timelines, *each timeline is presented in chronological order*.  You'll never be fed a scene about the Flying Pussyfoot that happens chronologically earlier than another Flying Pussyfoot scene.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann is the most energetic and heroic work I have seen so far. And I share the same feeling with you about episode 26 (I think I had tears of epicness in my eyes for the last third of the series especially [](/s "when Kittan made his final King Kittan Giga Drill Break")).
>> ARTICLE
Baccano can indeed be pretty confusing. Try to keep track of the dates so you know what happened before what, but after it goes on a bit it gets easier as you start to get to know the characters better. Still, it is very much worth the watch.

From my comment in the /r/trueanime thread:

Got off my ass and started watching episodic stuff that I've had on hold for the past 4-5 years. I'm terrible at watching episodic shows so I figured why not watch them the way they were intended to be watched: episodically?

**Mushishi** (5-10)

I definitely appreciate Mushishi more now than when I watched it before. It's stunning how the show develops and makes you care about a character that is only there for one episode. 

The animation and music are extremely deliberate and calming, meshing well with the whole "go with the flow" vibe. 

The voice acting also stood out to me, since it was much more subdued compared to most commercial anime, and it worked to the show's benefit. It just goes to show that you don't need to be yelling, screaming, or crying to show deep emotions of sorrow or anger. 

I like the whole theme of self-acceptance and self-actualization, but I'm not sure if I agree with some of the outcomes in the show (episode six), some of which too easily accept their respective fates.

I'm enjoying this one the most so far, it's very contemplative, reflective, and introspective. Doesn't hurt that the mushi themselves have interesting concepts. 

**Cowboy Bebop** (1-5)

Watched the first two eps however many years ago and put it on hold because of its episodic nature. Looks like I dropped it just before things start picking up more. Episode 3 was solid. Then episode 5 had a huge tonal shift from the previous ones. I'm guessing I'll be fed bits and pieces of the main casts' pasts and they'll all be similar to episode 5 in some ways. 

Animation: great fight choreography from Bones. The OST stands out too, contributing to the whole space western theme. 

I've got really nothing bad to say about it so far. Looking forward to see the characters develop more. 

**Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex** (1-2)

I actually watched the first two episodes before but forgot most of it. I enjoy scifi for its examination of the human condition and the questions it posits about what it means to be human. GitS:SAC certainly delivers on both counts so far. I like how the worldbuilding is presented. Instead of shoving expositional narration/dialogue in your face, it simply shows that some of the stuff just *is* in this universe, like cyberized brains, cyborgs, etc. Very efficient and concise storytelling. Looking forward to the thematic ideas here. 

The Major's outfit is ridiculous though. 

I've also been watching Chu2Ren for the weekly "anime" anime dose. Nothing much to say about that one. 

Still rewatching **Fate/zero** with /r/anime. I forgot how much I liked the Lancer episode with Kiritsugu's speech. Also the flashback episodes were great again.
>> ARTICLE
SAC picks up as the series gets rolling, and is probably my all-time favourite. Though personally I feel the second season was the stronger of the two, the continuing story in the first season is really good.

Also, hang in there, because the Major isn't going to put on some damn pants until 2nd gig.

Good to know. I stopped watching the first time I tried because it was a bit slow.

*Recommended by: roommate*

> If you could give form to happiness, what would it be like?

Started off in a weird place, but soon kicked back into that signature overdrive of pacing after some callbacks and parallels to the first season. There are a lot of dealings with international relations and politics which lead to some grandiose battle sequences. A lot of double-crosses and challenges to motivations. If I had to complain Id say that the presence of the subtext in the dialog isnt as strong as before and the focus is much more drawn to the drama in the plot developments, some of which had me giggling more than anything else. But there is a sense that something very large is culminating and god damn I cant wait to see it. C.C. best pizza girl. Flow best openings. Chinese Eunuchs worst voicing.

[Episode 5](/s "A seasons worth of fanservice with some extreme camera positioning.")

**[Bakuman.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7674/Bakuman.) (1-13/25)**

*Recommended by: relative*

*Theme: scout out a show that the other has not seen but is interested in*

> The future will be nothing more than an extension of the present

Infectious. Right from the start the show exudes this pure, unfiltered excitement from its main duo  and later from the secondary cast  that really ropes you in and leaves you wanting to return. The scenes in the studio are a stand out as we bear witness to the process of creation and the formation of an artistic identity. We also get some understated insight into and commentary of the manga and anime industries through Mashiros uncle and Hattori as a member of the editorial staff. The humor is light but effective and serves the tone of the show. The more drama-intensive segments range from silly to engaging. The romantic aspect is actively frustrating though charming in its own right. Ive also heard enough Ganbatte!s to last me a lifetime. Excited to see where this goes.

[Episode 4](/s "God dammit Mashiro you faked me out twice on that hill I have no sympathy for you anymore.")

> There is no better time to part than when we wish for it never to end

[I could listen to Lawrence & Holo banter all day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wINa_YZj-kg). So the visuals look a little more pristine on the production side of things. Structurally we get two main arcs where the main merchant duo arrive in a new town, meet a new contact, and get involved in a dealing that introduces some risk not only financially but also to the stability of Holo and Lawrence as partners. There is a little more depth thematically and within the actual transactions themselves which was a welcomed change. As always, top-notch romance. Probably picking up the light novels in the future.

**OreImo S1 &specials** (15/15)    
Great comedy, with a pretty good sibling reconciliation relationship thing. Some hints of romance, and it's about a 7-8/10    
**Puella Magi Madoka Magica Rebellion 3**    
As per usual, the artstyle brilliantly conveys a feeling of general creepiness and unease. I didn't enjoy it as much as the anime series, but the story was still good, and the open ending wasn't done in too much an unsatisfactory way. 8.5/10
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Spice and Wolf, both seasons. I would recommend it. The second season ending was not what I had expected but it really did fit the show. I watched the dub for the first season. I tried watching the sub for the second, but I really didn't like Lawrence's voice although I liked both Holo's. 

In the English they both sound a lot older which makes sense since they are both pretty old compared to most anime, while in the sub they sound a lot younger especially Holo. 

Would recommend 9/10

**[Kyoukai no Kanata](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18153/Kyoukai_no_Kanata) (1-10/12)**

I liked it early on but things started getting weird towards the end. Honestly there's not much to say, it's enjoyable but doesn't really stands out in any way. I'll probably try to watch the last 2 episodes soon and just get over it. 

Score: **7/10**

**[Nagi no Asukara](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16067/Nagi_no_Asukara) (1-11/26)**

I expected nothing from it because the cover on MAL is pretty generic, but I'm really enjoying it. The visuals on this anime are just amazing, and I'm really enjoying the story and characters. I'm really looking forward to marathoning the last 15 episodes.

Score: **9/10** - Has the potential for 10/10.

**[Prince of Tennis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22/Prince_of_Tennis) (1-5/178)**

This is my new "filler" anime, something that I watch just to kill some time. There's not much to say about it, I expected a normal shounen-sport anime and that's what I got, and that's fine.

Score: **7/10**

**[Hitsugi no Chaika](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20853/Hitsugi_no_Chaika) (12/12)**

I really liked this one, but definitely needs a season 2 to close the story out. The show has potential and I like most of the characters.

Score: **7/10** - Probably a 8/10 if the second season closes the story out. Also pls more Red Chaika.

Nagi no Asukara is kind of an oddball, I loved it but by the end it wasn't what I believed it would be, whatever is the reason you are liking it so far I suggest keeping your expectations in check.

I'm with you on Kyoukai no Kanata, it had a great start but then it slowly started to go downhill and with every episode that passed I liked it less and less. I wanted to like it so hard and just couldn't.

**FLCL** (ep1-end)  
Really crazy and cool, smart little over-the-top action series. (Rating: 8/10)

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Lagann-hen** (movie)  
Watched part1 of the movies the other day and finished now. The movies are a bit rushed but the fights are a lot cooler. I think if they would have mixed a bit of the movies into the series it would have made it even better. (Rating: 9/10)

**Mawaru Penguindrum** (ep1-3)  
Crazy looking, interesting and funny for now. Looking forward to watch this further.

**Yuru Yuri** (Complete): All in all, a pretty nice season. Decently amusing, and some pretty nice character chemistry. Episodes 10 and 11 were pretty nice, but the attempted drama in the second half of Episode 11 didn't really work for me.  
And then there's **Episode 12**. I already had some idea of what to expect (the [tomato](http://i4.minus.com/ibpPJtvRn4P5cL.png) and the [murder scene](http://i1.minus.com/ibdPFfbJtnZFQO.png)), but never expected it to be this insane. It's like they saved all the craziness for this single last episode. Well, not complaining, this episode singlehandedly bumped the show to 8/10 for me.

Also, not many shows can go out with a literal bang.
>> ARTICLE
I finished Non Non Biyori just yesterday and wow, I enjoyed it. I'm not too much a fan of slice of life shows like this, but I feel like I enjoyed it because of the setting, and the difference in age between all the characters made it feel refreshing. Needless to say, I can't wait for season 2.
>> ARTICLE
**The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.** I just finished the Endless Eight arc. It wasn't as bad as I anticipated given people's complaints about it. I got a little tired of the dialogue after a while but I enjoyed picking out the differences in each episode and trying to figure out how it all was going to wrap up.

Also **White Album 2.** It's my first real drama/romance anime, and the tension is real. I'm not looking forward to how it ends because I know I'm going to end up sad for somebody.
>> ARTICLE
My biggest problem with Endless Eight is that they spent 8 episodes out of a 14 episode season repeating the same thing.  If it was a 26 episode season, that'd be different, but they spent literally over half the season repeating the same events over and over.  That was unforgivable, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It was definitely a huge risk on the creator's part to invest over half the season on the same set of events. But I look at it as the creator trying to make us empathize with the character of Nagato. She remembered and lived through every repeat, but couldn't do anything to stop it; she merely had to observe the events. Just like us. All we could do was watch and see what happens. The show hints that Nagato was starting to become emotionally compromised from the ordeal, and I think they wanted us to feel those same emotions. I don't know how they decided that eight episodes was the right number but whatever. 

The thing that bothered me the most, is the events that took place are never mentioned again. It's as if repeating the same two-week cycle over 15000 times had absolutely no effect on the characters afterwards. 
>> ARTICLE
**Haibane Renmei (13/13)**

This was a nice, poignant, slow-paced show. I enjoyed it, but I couldn't help feeling like it missed quite a few opportunities to develop itself further. 

Don't get me wrong; there's nothing wrong with leaving things unexplained in order to preserve a sense of mystery. But for instance, I thought one of the most thematically interesting sections was [spoiler](/s "early on, when we see Rakka trying to stay strong and deal with her emotions after Kuu's departure, and all of the 'normal' townsfolk just see her as a 'lucky' Haibane who ought to be bright and cheerful all the time. That was a really clever parallel to the way you often hear people with depression describe being treated, and I was hoping the show would explore it further, but it just sort of got dropped.")

**Hunter x Hunter (23/148)**

I've been putting this one off for months, just due to the sheer intimidating number of episodes. But now that the finale's aired, I'm diving in and giving it a shot.

So far I'm not blown away or anything, but it's pretty enjoyable. It feels like the show *ought* to feel very formulaic, but the details and plot twists continue to surprise and entertain me. As it is, I'd probably rate it at least a 7/10; but from what I keep hearing, it gets even better around the Chimera Ant arc, so I'll definitely keep watching to see how that plays out.

Also, [spoiler](/s "I know Killua comes from a family of assassins and all, but *holy shit* I did not expect there to be this much straight-up murder.")
>> ARTICLE
About your spoiler x spoiler: lol.

Good luck with the rest of the series if you're surprised about that.

**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun**: One of the funniest shows I've ever watched. As everyone's already said, this show really is a deconstruction of a romance show, but in a humorous way. The characters, gags, art style, voice acting, and music (OP and ED) were all fucking awesome; there aren't a lot of things to hate about it really (in fact, I hated nothing about it at all), unless you're going to be extremely critical, which I wouldn't bother. I nominate Mikorin as BEST GIRL of this show. Hoping for a second season. 10/10

**Rail Wars**: Well, well, well. This show got a lot of shit because of the forced Ecchi. But honestly, it wasn't a bad show. Sure, I can critique it for being bad as an Action show (or a show about trains, in general), but once I've figured out that this show was obviously meant to be a Ecchi/Harem with women mysteriously falling in love for the wimpy MC, I just stopped caring and enjoyed it for what it was. **TL;DR Failure as an Action. Succeeds at being a Harem/Ecchi. An OK show in general.** 7/10

**Hyouka**: I liked it a lot. This show is like a SoL version of Detective Conan (being a lot tamer in both setting and cases they're involved). We have a 8man-esque protagonist, except a lot less cynical. All the other characters are likeable and are interesting in some way. I like how one of the mysteries they solved isn't a completely happy resolution, and I think it helps Houtaro realize of what he's actually capable of. Also, that OVA (Ep 11.5) was really good. I mean, it wasn't anything special compared to the rest of the episodes, but I love how they handled the fanservice. It was tastefully done in a way that it doesn't violate the characters. Good stuff, KyoAni. Last episode wasn't much of an ending, but it'll do. [ ](/s "God damn it, Houtaro you should've just succumbed to a rose-colored life with Chitanda.")  9.5/10

**Rokujouma no Shinryakusha?! (ep 10-12)**: I was very pleased with how they handled the harem. [Potential Spoiler](/s "Every girl was happy in the end and everyone's happy just by living alongside Koutarou.") Speaking of Koutarou, he was a very competent harem MC. Probably one of the best I've seen. I heard that this season was only a Prologue to the real plot, so I'm hoping that people would support this show so we can have Season 2. I want more Yurika in my life (seriously, she's always saving their asses but never rewarded. I want to give her a huge hug.) Also, I haven't read the LNs yet, this is just a speculation, but I'm pretty sure [ ](/s "both Koutarou and Sakuraba, being the Knight and Princess, are immortal beings who can travel through time and dimensions. I bet the guy which every girl in the harem seem to look up to is and was actually Koutarou.") All in all, an enjoyable anime as long as you don't expect too much out of it. 8/10

Edit: I forgot to mention that even though most of the VA cast for Rokujyouma were first-timers, they were all really good, especially Sanae's and Yurika's. I just hope none of them somehow fall into H-titles like most beginners do.

I liked how it wasn't as Shonen-y as Code Geass and I liked how it fit inside the timeline nicely. Aside from that, I like the fair portrayal (as of now) of each side of the conflict. Plus, the CG was Arpeggio of Blue Steel levels of tolerable and it was woven in pretty well.   
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I quite enjoy the way the OVA presents something that is recognisably in the same extravagant world but has a colder, chillier mood. IIRC the outfit that does the 3DCG work for it is Orange, who did a decent job on Majestic Prince, too. The second episode has some of the finest 3DCG mecha action I've seen in anime, though I'm not quite convinced that they get the cloaks to work.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched the second one. I'm planning to keep it on hold until 2015...the one year gaps between each 40 minute episode is almost unbearable.

Quality over quantity I guess. It's like waiting for a new Berserk chapter! 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes. Gundam Unicorn was a similar experience. But spare a thought for people who watched Giant Robo as it was [coming out](http://puu.sh/bRJGN/870f8bf0e0.png) that gap before the last episode is fearsome.

Haha that 3 year wait was like me waiting for the 3rd Evangelion rebuild movie. 

And as a Berserk fan, there was a period of time where we only got a chapter a year.....

Not a whole lot, thanks to grad school starting up this week. 

[**White Album 2**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2) **8/13**

Really enjoying this so far! I decided I'd stop because I was afraid it was going to start getting sad, based on everything I've heard about it. I'm probably going to end up finishing it later tonight though... I didn't actually think I was going to enjoy this as much as I am, because I never thought I'd like something that was focused around music. 

**EDIT**

Finished it. Fuck that. I didn't cry at all, I just rolled my eyes and got really angry [because](/s "Haruki is a fucking asshole. You don't just cheat on someone because you've 'loved someone else for longer!!!' like whatever, yeah you slept with another girl and then went with your current girlfriend to say goodbye to the other girl and kissed her and yeah fuck that. And Setsuna is blaming herself and trying to tell Haruki it's okay, when it's just clearly not."). Liked the first 3/4 of the show, but fuck that ending, man. Brought what would have been a really high score for me down to a 6. Would be even lower, but the first 9 or so episodes were amazing.

I'm watching **Samurai Champloo**, which I really like. I'm also rewatching **Bakemonogatari**, and while it's still not amazing, it is better the second time around.

[Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=5081) (episode 1): Solid so far, not totally blown away but still pretty good. Gonna try to finish the whole thing (which means first season) next week.

[Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=10165) (1-17): I give a lot of 10s, but I think all of them deserve it, including this one. Many lol moments. Was really busy this week so I couldn't finish but on the other hand still have some episodes left so more epic moments.

I finished **Initial D** through the fourth stage as it's being taken off Netflix as of October 1st. I also finished **Eden of the East: King of Eden**, **Dance in the Vampire Bund**, and **Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne** for the same reason.

I've started **The Rose of Versailles**, **Macross**, **Psycho-Pass**, and **Bakemonogatari** because of /r/watchinganime.

I really like *Initial D*, but I don't think binge watching is the best format for it. *King of Eden* wasn't as good as the series and I wasn't thrilled with the ending of *Dance in the Vampire Bund*. I have mixed feelings on *Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne*. I think there's some good things in there, but they kind of get lost amongst the sex and gore.

So far, I'm not a fan of *Rose of Versailles* as I don't like most of the characters other than the lead. *Macross* is as fun as I remembered it, while I haven't really got interested in *Psycho-Pass* yet. As for *Bakemonogatari*, I'm not a fan of Hitagi.

I remember putting Baccano! on hold because of all of the airing shows.  Now that I finished all of them, I decided to watch some Baccano!

I'm now 13/16.  This is because there are 3 specials and I look forward to the last 3 over the next few days.

Overall, it was such a great ride on the Pussyfoot.  [Spoilers](/s "There was like 7 opposing forces at once on that train, holy shit and was it god damn entertaining.  If I can remember there were: black suit guys, white suit guys, news paper people, rail tracer, Jakuzi's gang, Isaac and Miria, Immortal kid.")

The amount of gore, blood and swearing as well as a great English dub just couldn't make me any happier for this show.

All characters are best.  If I could choose my favorite, it's got to be the pair of Isaac and Miria.  I can always be happy whenever their presence is around on screen or off screen.
>> ARTICLE
I think Baccano had one of the best English dubs I've ever heard, but I can't get over how amazing Isaac and Miria are in Japanese.  It's a shame their classic intro dialogue wasn't really translatable.

"Nee, Aizakku~"

"Nandai, Miria?"
>> ARTICLE
Do you recommend watching Baccano in Japanese?  I'm real curious on what you're talking about in terms of their intro dialogue for Issac and Miria.

I believe Baccano was like the only English dubs I've watched all the way through besides Clannad, Angel Beats!, Kanon and Air.  The only other good English dubs I hear is this one, Welcome to the NHK and Cowboy Bebop, that's about it. :/

X-post from TrueAnime:

**Cardcaptor Sakura (complete)**

---

I can't remember the last time I watched this many episodes of a single franchise. It was fun, but honestly kind of exhausting. Even emotionally draining. It's sad to see some of these character go after spending so much time with them, but at the same time I'm kinda glad it's over with. It was interesting to get back to the "heart" of the modern Magical Girl genre, as CCS is often seen as one of the cornerstones of the genre. And you can definitely see a lot of the now ubiquitous tropes at work. Though in a surprise twist, I actually thought Kero was one of the most compelling characters in the story, a feat I wouldn't see repeated until Madoka. On the other hand, the monster-of-week format certainly felt less refined than what I'm used to in this genre. How many cards show up at Sakura's school, honestly? Not a single one decides to fuck around at the high school? It's awfully considerate for so many of them to cause mischief in places that Sakura has easy access to. I would have liked more break-in style and problem-solving. I'm also used to the episodic conflicts being more reflective of the victims or the protagonists. In CCS many of the cards felt like they just showed up because the plot demanded it. Episodes like the Silent or Dash episodes felt much more effective to me. I have to confess that after a while, I just threw on the terrible Animax dub and let the episodes play in the background. Not that they weren't enjoyable, but it was alarmingly easy to predict which episodes were going to be substantive enough to warrant full attention. 

One of the other things I liked  about CCS was definitely its design aesthetic. From Tomoyo's many outfits to the individual Clow creatures. Everything felt distinct and fresh, drawing ideas from tons of different sources(Chinese and western mysticism particularly), but also felt believably grounded in a singular vision. From the adorably feral Dash(which I can't help but feel looks like early concept art for Espeon) to the feminine beauty of cards like Mirror or Song, and everything in-between. The character designs were equally distinctive and recognizable even after costume changes, which is sometimes hard to pull off in animation. 

I've already talked a fair bit about the characters, and I think they got a pretty satisfactory amount of development. This was a long show, and it definitely used that to flesh out most of the cast into believable people. Most of the the cast. Some late-arrivals and a few supporting characters didn't really evolve beyond their single-note personalities. Meiling in particular was "girl who likes Xiaolang a whole lot" right down to her final big character moment. The final villain also felt bafflingly inconsistent in terms of personality. Swinging from masterful troll to wise mentor sometimes in the span of a single episode. Nakuru felt more consistent and vibrant in her(his? Its?) interactions with Toya, and I think that's a bit of a problem for a show's big baddie to have. Overall though, definitely likable and well-realized characters for children's show with such a large ensemble cast.

I gotta say though, my biggest problem with the show was the romantic subplots. Most of them felt incredibly forced, and directionless. It felt like most of them just existed for the sake of the big reveal in the Act Two finale, and they didn't know where to go with any of them for the last arc. The romance I felt most invested in was Toya's romantic subplot with the Mirror card, and that doesn't seem like a good place for a story's romance elements to be in! Sakura and Xiaolang's relationship was too clunky and jokey for me to really buy into their feelings for the final episode. Really good, close friends? Definitely. Romantic partners? I wasn't feeling it. Tomoyo's largely unspoken love for Sakura felt far more natural by the end of the series. I didn't mind the conclusion, but it definitely lacked the impact that the show intended. 

Anyways, it was quite an enjoyable stroll through Magical Girl history. Certainly more so than SM:Crystal has been. CCS has an essence of unrefined beauty to it. A landmark series that paved the way for dozens of successors, and ironically can't quite to live up to its own legacy. But there is still plenty of good, even great, things at work in this show! And it's a testament to those things that CCS continues to stay relevant after so many years. 8/10.

**Petite Princess Yucie (12/26)**

---

Continuing my adventures into old anime for little girls, Petite Princess Yucie is an odd little show. Ostensibly an adaptation of the Princess Maker RPG, this honest-to-goodness shoujo anime comes to us from good old Gainax. And I mean literally the good, old-Gainax. This show's staff list is kind of mind-boggling. It's directed by now ex-Gainax alumni and Trigger co-founder Masahiko Ohtsuka. Yeah, really. It's also scripted by Steins;Gate writer Jukki Hanada. And those aren't even the most surprising names attached to this show. Credited under "Supervising Director" is none other than Mr. Mindfuck himself, Hideaki fucking Anno. [I shit you not.](http://i.imgur.com/gp7tMDS.png) That's right, The creator of NGE plays what I assume is equivalent to a Producer position on a cutesy-poo fantasy Magical Girl show. I don't even. 

But sure, names aren't everything. What is this show about, exactly? Well, it's the story of the naive, child-like Yucie who lives with her adoptive father Gunbard and her steward Cube in their quaint little home in the forest. Yucie is stubborn and quick-tempered, but she's a happy child with an overly doting father. And one slight problem. She's not actually a child at all. For some mysterious reason, 17-year-old Yucie has never physically aged beyond her 10-year-old body. Fed up with always being treated like a child, she wants nothing more than be a real grown up. She gets her golden opportunity when she unwittingly stumbles upon a magic tiara hidden deep within her kingdom's castle. It is an omnipotent magical item known as the Eternal Tiara, and will grant one wish to whoever possesses it. The catch is that only the chosen Platinum Princess can claim the tiara and make her wish. And Yucie has just been named a candidate. She's enrolled into Princess Academy where she'll learn what it takes to be a princess. She'll have to overcome many challenges and the other candidates in order to get her wish. 

So, to put it simply, a young girl who wants to magically become an adult must first overcome a quest and grow as a person. That is about as straightforward as these things can get, I think. The moral of the story is built into the friggin' synopsis! "You don't become an adult by growing older, but by growing wiser" Real subtle guys! In fact, it's pretty easy to draw parallels to FLCL here. Being superficially "adult" doesn't make you grown up! But this is a kids show, and that's a pretty important lesson to learn. What follows is mostly a lesson-of-the-week style story where Yucie works part-time jobs(part of the academy's curriculum), makes new friends, and travels to the other magical realms to gather the pieces of the Eternal Tiara. It's a surprisingly engaging little story with fun characters and just enough individuality to be refreshing.

I love Cardcaptor Sakura. I used to watch it with my sister when it used to air on Taiwanese television when I was in elementary school. I've since then revisited it and it still holds up.

**[Itazura na Kiss](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=3731) (13-25/25)**  
7/10. Pretty cheesy but that's what I was looking for so I can't complain! I enjoyed the two main characters but everyone else was pretty weak to be honest. The second half was more like a slice of life which I enjoyed.

**[Fate/Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=10087) (7-13/13)**  
7/10. I started this two months ago and put it on hold because I wasn't really feeling it. But after picking it up again I enjoyed it more, I'll definitely watch the second season sometime.

**[My Little Monster](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=14227) (13/13)**  
7.5/10. Better than I expected, a good rom-com with a solid cast. The MC is a nice change of pace from some others I've seen. Definitely worth the watch, hopefully we get another season.

**[Ao Haru Ride](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=21995) (12/12)**  
7.5/10. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, I think I'll watch more shoujo romances. I wish [Ao Haru Ride](/s "it didn't have such an open ending though, they really built my hopes up for some romance. Guess they just want you to buy the manga to find out. But I suppose an open ending is preferable to an original ending, so I can't be too mad."). Worth watching, definitely!

**[K-On!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On!) (1-5/13)**  
I was told there would be cute girls doing cute things and that's pretty much what I'm getting! It's a nice change of pace from my usual choice of dramatic shows.

Woo one of my favorite parts of the week!

[Ano Natsu de Matteru:](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=11433) (12/12)

I dropped this show a while back for some odd reason. I went back to it and realized that this is one hell of a good show. I still have a little bit of a problem with some of the characters that i'm not really gonna go into but no matter what this show is great and gets a 8/10 from me. [Ano Natsu spoilers](/s "That ending tore my heart out, cooked it for dinner, and then fed it to a mangy mut. Poor Glasses-kun")

[Kaichou wa Maid-Sama!:](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=7054) (26/26)

Easily my favorite Shoujo show. Everything about it was so likable and there never was a dull moment. Usui is 2cool4me and Ms. Tsundere is really indecisive but that doesn't matter because they go pretty well together. 9/10. Don't tell me that Kimi ni Todoke is better because I've already been told that millions of times. I'll get to it someday. 

[Noragami:](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=20507) (12/12)

Easily the best show I have watch this week. I really couldn't find anything wrong with this show. I feel like this show is perfect in every way. I may just have a shit taste in anime and can't see the flaws in it, and that's probably true. I mean it even has a reference to my favorite game series Monster Hunter, like Noragami you didn't need to earn these extra points but you did it anyways. 10/10 

[Jormungand: First season](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=12413) (12/12)

Explosions! Muscular men and women! Guns! This show is really fun and reminds me of my first time watching Black Lagoon. Little lighter on the cussing though. Koko is the best character of this show and really pulls everything a long. And Jonah is a beast for just being a kid. I'm excited to watch the next season and I feel like it's gonna get a lot heavier then what this season was, and I'll accept that. 9/10
>> ARTICLE
That's how I felt about noragami, exemplified by that fact that monster hunter is also my favorite game series. Season 2 is also really good but hopefully the novels pick up pace and we can have a final season soonish!
>> ARTICLE
In the past week I watched:

Zero no Tsukaima (all 4 seasons)
Started it knowing nothing, but it may or may not be a good idea unless your into stuff like heavy fanservice, or just a big fan of romance/comedy.
Literally half the show was fanservice, but the other half was a good attempt at plot...  Enjoyable enough, and has some feels to it [S2 finale i think](/s "Main character dies, so yeah. Feels. ") 

I also began a rewatch on Mobile Suit Gundam 00.

Ok so maybe it wasn't this week, but LAST week, I watched Log Horizon and enjoyed it, though at some points it moves a little slow (not necessarily a bad thing)
>> ARTICLE
So I have an exorbitant amount of free time right now due to my class schedule this fall. I've absolutely been powering through anime and manga like it's my job (because I haven't started my job yet), so I'll only talk about a few I watched this week. I've also recently found out what josei is so that's predominately what I've been watching as I happen to be 24/F who loves me some romance. 

[*Kuragehime*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Jellyfish)- This is a truly a fabulous anime with an excellent opening and ending song. I love the animation on the [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJoeGEEu5L4) especially. I think the characters are endearing, the story is a little something different. I've never been so excited about a cross-dressing male lead before, with the exception of Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club. If you like comedy, slice of life, and a scootch of romance please give this a try. You won't regret it. That being said, the anime sort of gives up the last episode because there was no chance for a second season. The manga is much more intricate and allows for more character development of the other Amars. Considering that I give it a 9.5/10

[*Natsuyuki Rendevous*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsuyuki_Rendezvous)- This is another josei. This is much more romance oriented. There is some humor in the form of the main man, Hazuki, and the deceased husband, Shimao, getting into funny spats. Hazuki sort of reminds me of a more self assured Hachiman. I thought the animation was gorgeous. I liked the first 6 episodes especially, be then it kind of fell off for me. Overall I would recommend this one. It was visually pleasing, romantic, and somewhat introspective. It gets a 8/10.

[*Kokoro Connect*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoro_Connect) 10/13 episodes- Like most people on this sub, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about after the best girl contest. I mean, how can this chick beat **Shinobu**?! Freaking *Shinobu*!! So I had to find out. Honestly, I dig it. I think the show does an excellent spin on a somewhat well established body switching scenario. I definitely will finish it soon. However, Inaba is no kiss-shot acerola-orion heart-under-blade. That being said, I'm thinking 8/10 at this point? It could get more points depending on the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter :(
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate - It was just as good as everyone said it would be. 10/10

Ben-to - Silly and somehow entertaining. It was surprisingly good. I think I gave it a 7 or so.
>> ARTICLE
**Bakuman** has been my current "older" show watch. Since it's 3 seasons and 75 (?) episodes it's taken me awhile. I think I just hit the finale to season 2.

Really enjoying it. It does seem kind of slow at times, but I enjoy the quirky characters. I've never been a big fan of slice-of-life, but for whatever reason this story really drew me in. Started watching because of a comment from one of the Nozaki episode threads when someone asked if there were any other series that dealt with mangaka.

Also, so far, this series has one of the best bromances I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman. Amazing show, easily my favorite manga of all time.  But God dammit, pretty much all of the problems in that show would be solved instantly if the characters would have just fucking talked to each other about their problems.
>> ARTICLE
**Samurai Champloo.** I enjoyed Bebop quite a bit, so I thought I'd give its spiritual successor a try. I'd It has the same primary problem as Bebop did: the episodic structure of each plotline. However, it works a bit better here, since the plots tend to be less serious in this show. It's more about the dialogue and music. 
>> ARTICLE
I finished Durarara last week and gotta say I really like the show. I am looking forward to the second season I heard about.

I started Katanagatari as well and am watching 1 episode per day because those many dialogues are exhausting after an hour. It's a pretty good show but I was let down by the off screen fight in episode 4.

**Ai Yori Aoshi**

**Nodame Cantabile**

**[White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2) (2-6/13)** - Well, that's one of best romances I've ever watched, even tho it's pretty obvious how will it end (unless I am wrong).

**[Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9379/Denpa_Onna_to_Seishun_Otoko) (7-10/12)** - I love Shaft, I really do. Every single anime from this studio is awesome and this one is no different.

**[Haiyore! Nyaruko-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11785/Haiyore!_Nyaruko-san) (3-9/12)** - Great parody, laughed really hard few times, also love this opening, so catchy.

**[The Tatami Galaxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=7785) (4-6/11)** - It's just impossible to describe this anime, every single episode is really big dose of mindfuck. However this is enjoyable show.

Just marathoned Psycho-Pass due to my friend telling me I should watch it since Season 2 is coming out in a week away. Really liked it but I just wished some of the characters had better backstories. 
>> ARTICLE
Over the past 3-5 days, I've marathoned pretty much the entirety of the Monogatari series. Bake > Nise > Neko > Second Season > Hana.

Jesus christ some of these episodes. All in all, I loved the way the shows were paced and I especially loved the various animation styles and quirks. But some of them... the stories ended in ways that just made me shake my head and think, "That's now how this is supposed to happen..." The episodes which made me think like this seemed to exclusively be in Second Season. I'd love to talk more in terms of specifics but there is far too much to sift through now that I've marathoned it all.

The two arcs in particular were [Spoilers for Second Season](/s "Nadeko Medusa and Shinobu Time. Nadeko Medusa was simply jarring because I simply did not expect Nadeko to go quite so insane; I thought she would at least be talked out of it by the end of the arc. But that didn't happen, and no satisfying resolution was reached until Hitagi End. At least there's hope for her. As for Shinobu Time, I was enjoying it as one of my favorite stories in the entire series up until it made me cry. Although I've looked ahead at chapter names in the LNs not-yet adapted, apparently there's one called Mayoi Hell which gives me hope that we'll see Hachikuji again. I just hope that the name doesn't imply a sad end for her, and if someone's read the LNs I'd honestly love to be spoiled and told if she gets to come back from the afterlife.")

One thing's for certain though: if Taiga Aisaka had to lose to anyone in the best girl contest, I'm glad it was Shinobu. Also Kaiki is a worthy challenger for best guy.

**Yowamushi Pedal (38/38)**

I don't even remember why I decided to watch the first episode. But damn am I glad I did. This anime is WAY to hype to be about bicycles, and every single time someone activated another freaking trick during a race to "power-up" I couldn't help but lose it. The weakest part for me is the MC, and although he's pretty lame all around, when he starts to get serious I can't help but smile. Also it might seem insane to have 4 episodes to get to the first checkpoint of a race, but I felt like they filled the time well. Super fun watch, and I'm dying til Grande Road next week

Macross Frontier, just finished the first Macross and Macross Zero a few days ago and am about to start frontier. Not sure if I'll like it, I don't like the design of the Main characters.

**GJ-bu**: Eh, it was there. I don't really have much to say about this show because not much actually happens in it. None of the characters really stands out as all that great and there were one or two scenes that were decently amusing. I didn't keep a count, but I think there were a total of maybe 5 scenes that took place outside of the clubroom.

**Hanasaku Iroha (15/26)**: Characters! Plot! More than one setting! I've watched 15 episodes of this in the last 3 days. Its fair to say I'm enjoying it, at least more than I did "Nothing Happens The Animation." Honestly, this has been on my 'to watch' list for a while, and I finally got around to watching it because of something an anonymous user said in the last Glasslip post. Thanks, random guy/girl!

Of the 3 JoJos I've watched so far, I think I like Joseph the best. Stardust Crusader's Jotaro isn't really doing it for me. 
>> ARTICLE
**Hanayamata** was disappointing. The whimsical and fantastical tone of the first episode, particularly the opening and when Naru first meets Hana was different, and I would have liked it if it continued in that direction, however the rest of the episodes are straightforward cute girls doing cute things, dancing, and quite a bit of contrived drama. There's not a whole lot of Yosakoi dancing, but there's a good sense of progression start learning how to dance, making their costumes, suffering setbacks and continuing on. The drama is where I felt the show really fell on it's face most of the time. It felt very fake, drama for the sake of drama, and dealt with in way that seemed just too neat and tidy, like [spoiler](/s "Machi's issue with her sister"), and [spoiler](/s "Hana's leaving for America and then returning just as they were going to perform"). 6/10

**Toradora (Completed)**  
I really feel the need to talk about this, as it left the biggest impact on me I have experienced from anime in a long time. This is a fantastic show. Easily one of the best romance anime ever. The sheer amount of emotion it can pack into a scene when it needs to, while remaining largely lighthearted and comedic the rest of the time is truly an impressive feat. The characters are brilliant, and the way they interact with each other is just delightful. I may not have enjoyed it to its fullest extent, but that's mainly because of stupid shipping reasons (Minori best girl, all the way). Overall, it's a very special experience, and something nearly everyone should watch.

**Mahoromatic**  
This is a fun show. I'm only 6 episodes in, but so far it's pretty good. It's a fanservice-filled, easygoing show, with a dash of Gainax awesomeness. It suffers from early 2000s animation, but it doesn't detract too much from my enjoyment.

I did the first season of **Maria-sama ga Miteru** in the last week. To be entirely honest I'm not super sure about it, it feel like its a comedy but I don't know if I'm laughing at the right parts of it or if its just sort of awkward (I mean, it is awkward, but is it supposed to be funny awkward or is this just me reacting to situations as I see them instead of what they want)

I'm ready for season 2 though, to see more Very Good Friends
>> ARTICLE
Comedy? Marimite is a character drama. It doesn't shy away from humour, but they're not really the "point".

Also you should watch the DVD specials (Maria-sama ni wa Naisho).
>> ARTICLE
the bloopers, right? I caught those

but I dunno, there was something about the first season that made me think that they were sort of winking and nodding over some of the more over-blown yuri/class S cliches, a little bit of self-parody I guess

I might just be in the wrong mindset/too old to take high school drama seriously
>> ARTICLE
**Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei (2.5/12)**

Kind of funny, but not really pulling me in. I thought I would like it since I liked Welcome To The NHK and WataMote. 

>> ARTICLE
After the Aldnoah.zero ending and recent akame ga kill chapter I decided I needed something funny to watch, so I started watching Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun). It's hilarious. 
>> ARTICLE
i watched the entirety of Neon Genesis Evangelion, plus the end of Evangelion. I'm probably going to watch it again, and another time after that. I barely got the plot, i didnt even try to get the *symbolism* and *2deep4me meaning*

yeah, i'll just watch it again. Definitely one of my favorites.
Oh and Asuka is a total bitch, and i'd probably be a wimp too if i were in shinji's postion. Rei is best girl

Blew through [Hataraku Maou-sama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama!) this weekend. It was pretty enjoyable but I honestly think it was more slice of life than I was expecting. It felt like nothing happened through the whole thing. Enjoyed it as a good little time killer though. 
>> ARTICLE
Finally finished Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari. Second season has been amazing so far. Should be finished by the weekend.

I've been watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and I am almost done with it now. While I definetely would call it a good show, it doesn't deserve the #1 spot on MAL by any stretch of the imagination, the writing is simply not that great and the antagonists seem to be about as smart as a bunch of potatoes.

I watched GJ club, loved it wish there was more but was pretty satisfied with the ending.

**[Baka to Test to Shokanjuu (6-13/13)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6347/Baka_to_Test_to_Shoukanjuu)**

**[Baka to Test to Shokanjuu: Ni! (1-13/13)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8516/Baka_to_Test_to_Shoukanjuu_Ni!)**

I found this to be much more enjoyable than I first expected it to be, it is (as far as I know) as original concept (with the whole ranking system and summoned beasts). The characters aren't anything too special but they don't make the show worse either. Overall for both series I would give it a **8/10**

---

**[Welcome to the NHK (13-24/24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/NHK_ni_Youkoso!)**

I finally got around to finishing this quite depressing series. If you haven't seen this anime, then don't take what I said in the wrong way! It is an extremely good show with a realistic insight on the ongoings of a hikkikomori's (probably spelled that wrong) daily life and the struggles he faces. Overall I gave it a **9/10**

---

**[K-On! (1-5/13)](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=5680)**

One of the two animes I watched this week that focuses more on the daily life of high-school friends. For this one it specifically gears towards the revival of the light music club. I've mostly avoided the 'music' genre of anime and was at first reluctant to give this a try, but I decided to go for it and I don't have any regrets so far, I would give a rating but I haven't really watched too much yet.

---

**[Lucky Star (1-20/24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=1887)**

Another cute anime following the simple life of 4 (3 really) high-school girls. The comedy is good and original. It has a sitcom feel to it that works really well. I'd say it is a **8/10**

---

**[Clannad (1-5/23)](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=2167)**

I haven't watched too much of this yet to give a good opinion on it so far, but it seems like it will be a good anime.

---

**[Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru (1-6/13)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14749/Ore_no_Kanojo_to_Osananajimi_ga_Shuraba_Sugiru#MoLYyMsdyvx1Xvto.99)**

I only chose to give this is a shot as it was listed as a recommendation under [Oregairu](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=14813) as the main protagonists were both anti-social people forced to join a club (for completely different reasons). I'm not too sure whether I really like Oreshura or not, it isn't really terrible but it doesn't give me anything new either. I would say it is a **7/10**

Started watching Bleach because it's the only one of the big three that I have never watched/read. Already 40+ episodes in and it's not so bad

**Mars of Destruction** (Completed) 


I wonder what their thought process was when they made this OVA. I like to think that they made this anime terrible on purpose. Imagine a group of the most imaginative minds in the world come together in a single room to create one of the worst anime to ever exist. They piled together all of their lunch money and hired the nearest person they can see to do the VA, Art, and effects. After everything was finished, they all watched it together and had a good laugh and released it to the rest of the world for all to see the master piece they had done. 



**Pupa** (Completed) 


I thought the art was nice but their execution of literally everything was off the mark. Sadly, I enjoyed this show too much. I don't know why, but I somewhat liked the story.



**Issho ni Sleeping: Sleeping with Hinako** (Completed)


I have never felt so awkward and pathetic because of an anime in my entire life. I tried to RP together with the girl in the anime and sadly, the girl in the anime was successful. I fell asleep because I couldn't stop not looking at the screen. She was looking at me the entire time and it just felt too awkward, but I did respond to her words. I'm never gonna RP with a video for the rest of my life. Never again.



**Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World** (Episode 1-5)


This was a breathe of fresh air. After binge watching all of those terrible anime, I couldn't help but feel ecstatic when I started watching this show. The story is great and the characters are lovable, but the art is sub par. I'm a huge fan of Mushishi, so watching this show which had the same feel as Mushishi but a bit more realistic is really great. I can't wait to watch the other episodes tomorrow.

DEATH NOTE. This anime has been an amazing experience, 10/10, I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes anime generally, because this show's writing and plot is simply awesome!
>> ARTICLE
**[Fate/Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10087) (13/13)**

Probably the best contemporary fantasy I've ever seen (not that I've seen any others...) **7/10**

**[Fate/Zero 2nd Season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11741) (12/12)**

Better than the first season, still a **7/10**

Also, the soundtrack is godlike.

**[Fate/Zero: Please! Einzbern Counseling Room](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13263) (6/6)**

These are probably the longest specials I've ever watched. **5/10**

**[Fate/Zero Remix](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13183) (2/2)**

Good summary, although I probably shouldn't have watched this right after the series. **7/10**

**[Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5114) (13-19/64)**

**[Ao Haru Ride: Unwritten](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24151) (1/1)**

More Kou middle school backstory? Yes please. **7/10**

**[Squid Girl Specials](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9888) (2/2)**

They took the best episode of Squid Girl and expanded upon it in two specials. I'm happy. **8/10**

**[Yama no Susume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355) (12/12) + [Yama no Susume: Kabette Kowakunai no?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17341) (1/1)**

Beautiful (and short) slice of life series. Onto the second season! **8/10**

**[Fate/stay night](http://myanimelist.net/anime/356) (24/24)**

I liked this more than Fate/Zero, which probably goes against what everyone thinks. That or I'm literally Satan himself. **8/10**

**[Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6922) (1/1)**

So we'll be getting a TV version of this route? Should be interesting, but I didn't like it as much as the first route (maybe that will change with the release of the new series?). I plan to play through the VN sometime soon anyways. **7/10**

**[Gundam Build Fighters](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19319) (1-9/25)**

I also started watching this with no knowledge of what I would get. Even if it seems to be geared towards kids, I'm still enjoying it.

**[Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081) (1-2/15)**

This is a very strange show. I was expecting something similar to Mekakucity Actors (which I disliked), and I can say It's somewhat similar, but it's nowhere near as bad thus far.
>> ARTICLE
How...how did you like Fate Stay Night more than Fate/Zero? Be honest, was it the moe? Or the basic shounen protagonist? Or the horrible melodramatic romance? 

Sorry, I can't control myself when I think about how bad Fate/Stay Night is. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm reading the Fate/Stay Night novels right now and they are definitely worth the time invested. I've finished Fate and I'm on the last day of UBW and it's really, really good.

I have yet to watch any of the animated stuff ( Fate/Zero, Deen F/S N, Deen F/S N UBW ), so can't really say if all the hate the stuff Deen made is justified, but I'm definitely super hyped about the ufotable UBW adaptation.

From what I've been told, most hate seems to come from the bad animation quality and mixing up all 3 routes in to one. 
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero a 7, and DEEN's fate/stay night an 8/10? I'm... I'm conflicted, on one hand I believe you've committed sacrilege of the highest order, and should be burned. But on the other hand I feel compelled to pat you on the back for being brave enough to say it. 

Touch Approva, touch.

Just an FWI, it seems that the Mushishi OVA on Crunchyroll is available for everyone to watch, not just subscribers. I can load the video just fine and it seems I can watch all 44 minutes of the special.

Forgive me, when I said sub-only, I meant that it's subtitled, not that it allows only subscribers. I'll go fix that right now! Thanks for pointing that out!

Don't worry about it, dude. We get a little excited when on Mushishi!

I just finished the first season to see this, going to get to the OVA soon. I'm assuming this will cover the last half of the manga? The entire first season made me wonder how you could possibly end this series.

I assume so. I haven't seen any information that elaborates on that, though, so it's more me just hoping, in the end :P

I know how you feel man, It's a bit hard balancing watching Evangelion and Yuyushiki. Talk about polar opposites... It's messing with me quite a bit. You can't expect to go from a mindfuck of a show to cute girls doing cute things and expect to remain emotionally stable.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm gonna have to take a break on the slice of life/romances for a bit. Takes too much out of me lol. After story probably wouldn't have made me cry so much if I hadn't just graduated high school this year and can relate to the show so well. I think I'm gonna have to watch something that is funny because it's so dumb to cheer me up.
>> ARTICLE
I'd give Nichijou, YuruYuri, and Tonari no Seki-kun a try for pretty mindless comedy. They're usually my go-to when I need something to just laugh about.

Will have to keep those in mind Ty.

Finally got around and watched Steins;Gate. Fucking amazing, if you ask me.

Now everyone! Join me in the intellectual experience that is Dr. Pepper!

I just finished Steins;Gate as well, but the movie pulled everything together really well.

I just watched the first 4 episodes...definitely intrigued and plan on finishing!

Cool, I just finished this as well and I loved it. IF you didn't watch the dub then you missed the [best engrish ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bf0aYBk0OQ)

That needs to be on a t-shirt.
I know I'd buy it.
>> ARTICLE
I also finished Steins;Gate and it blew my expectations  away. I am glad I watched it through. Still haven't watched the movie yet and will be watching it soon. The music is awesome as well.

>> ARTICLE
I just finished that a few days ago after much pressure from a friend.  I'm so glad I did.  I'm also really proud of myself for figuring out that [Steins;Gate Ep. 16](/s "Suzuha was Daru's daughter") an episode before that was shown. 

I've since started watching Fullmetal Alchemist after much pressure from this same friend.  I've made it to the end of episode 16 just now.  I'm so glad to actually have free time now that exams are over and it's the holidays.
>> ARTICLE
About your episode 16 spoiler, I did the same thing. It's probably one of my favorite aspects of Steins;Gate  it's an anime that just makes you think while you're watching it. It's just so immersive.
>> ARTICLE
One of the greatest things about Steins; Gate is that you will probably miss some things when you're watching it for the first time, but when re-watching it you catch these little things that foreshadow later events.
>> ARTICLE
[Steins;Gate spoilers](/s "When I rewatched it, some of the things Suzuha said blew my mind. Mainly when she doesn't understand what corn is and when she freaks out at a helicopter flying overhead. Pretty good foreshadowing.")
>> ARTICLE
Finished Gurren Lagann.

Started Haruhi Suzumiya.
>> ARTICLE
I also started Haruhi Suzumiya, and am weirded out by the apparent unexplained time skip for the baseball episode.
>> ARTICLE
I thoroughly enjoyed the broadcast order.  With jumping around you see facets of the story from different angles but by the end you are left with a complete picture.  
>> ARTICLE
Depending on the order you watch it, the show is out of chronological order.

That... doesn't surprise me. I'm watching on Crunchyroll in the order the episodes are listed.

**Shinsekai yori** - 25/25

Dropped after one of the first few episodes back when it aired since it didn't seem all that interesting. Finally decided to finish it since everyone was giving it rave reviews (subreddit logo was also made me curious) and it was absolutely fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
I stumbled across it back around February. It's a total gem, thrilled that it's getting more exposure. Reminds me of slow-paced western science fiction(ish) in the vein of The Giver. 
>> ARTICLE
Finished [Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) this week! Wow, what a series.

I really liked it up until End Of Evangelion. The old art style didn't bother me at all, I think the show still looks great and it doesn't seem to have aged to bad. I really liked the fight scenes, especially the one with Eva-02 in EoE. The characters were great too, as was the OST.

I was so confused after End of Evangelion that I didn't know what to think about the series. I didn't know if it deserved a 10/10 or a 1/10. After reading up on some stuff and after watching some videos explaining things, I can say I understand most of it now and I think the series is really clever.

Overall, I'd give it a 10/10, it was a great action series that evolved into something really fantastic near the end. Only complaint I have is that it should have asked me out to dinner before it mindfucked me.
>> ARTICLE
Are you planning to watch the Rebuild movies also? They're essentially all the cool action without most of the substance and with a higher budget; good for cleaning your palette.
>> ARTICLE
I do plan on doing so, yes. I'm just iffy about the CGI on the Evangelions... Do they use it for every action scene or only some? I've only seen three clips, every one was CGI.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I also finished NGE recently, and the ending really bothered me because I did not know what the fuck was happening. People told me that the movie wrapped everything up, but the only that the movie did was leave me even more questions.
>> ARTICLE
**Puella Magi Madoka Magica Episodes 2-4**

I picked it back up after /u/Novasylum I should probably get it over with. [Here's a link to my writeup on these first episodes](http://i.imgur.com/5cgvDi7.png)

Here's hoping I have fun with every episode after (finally)!

**Psycho-Pass Episode 7**

Still confused about how I feel about the utopia/dystopia that the world of PP presents. On the one hand, the figurative (and in today's episode, literal) death of creativity and the removal of natural suffering has led to a degradation of the human condition; the focus on punishment over therapy for those who Sybil system deems to be a threat to social order. On the other hand, I can't say that the purposeful spread of death and suffering that I think Makishima is implied to advocate is right, either. It's complicated...

...I guess it's not supposed to have an easy answer, huh?

**Tegami Bachi (Letter Bee) Episodes 1 - 10**

I sort of got tired of cycling between two Urobuchi shows, so I went to a random number generator, and picked the first show from my PTW list that matched a number.

It's a nice shounen, I guess? A Studio Pierrot production, the show is about a child and his desire to become a 'Letter Bee' - a member of the national postal service - after being saved by one in his youth. 

It's pretty by the books. It follows many of the same, fairly typical shonen tropes - protag doesn't want to hurt people, is a bright-eyed, naive youth, makes friends everywhere, has a secret ability that makes him special, etc. - and in that sense it's really nothing special. The art is also...well, low budget. Let's just leave it at that. It's not ugly, but it's clear Pierrot was working on a small budget with this show. It also doesn't have great writing, although it does take cares to not get too melodramatic or too preachy. 

But there is one thing that the show has a lot of: [heart.](http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s106/DaHaloChick/Blog%20Photos/Bleach%20Troll%20Blog/theheart.jpg) 

"Heart, you say, Garlock? I never learned about heart in my seminars on literary criticism!" And you're right, heart is an undefinable thing and is as far from an objective criticism of any show as you could possibly get. But still, that's all I can really describe it as. Thematically, the show is about connecting people; the letters are always described as feelings of the heart, and the Letter Bees themselves use magic guns powered by their heart to fight the beasts they encounter on their courier routes. Perhaps that's what lends it's strength? That it's so focused on thoughts, wants and desires of the heart that it resonates with the viewer (or at least me.)

The show is very innocent and heart-felt. Though the writing isn't particularly clever, it is rather charming and earnest. There isn't a drop of cynicism, but at the same time, it's not saccharine. It's just very...genuine. 

I think I needed this show. It's not cerebral or dense enough to make me want to take notes, but at the same time, it doesn't feel like empty calories. I probably won't rate this show higher than a 6 or 7, but I can't say I'm disliking what I'm watching.

Seto no Hanayome is really good, too bad season 2 is never coming...
>> ARTICLE
Are you going to read the Berserk manga now that you finished the anime series?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure. I'm not that big a fan of reading manga, but I also want to see more of the story. 


I probably will, just not yet
>> ARTICLE
I personally haven't seen of read it yet, but heard extremely good things about it, so I think I will watch and read it during downtime (watching 6+ shows atm).
>> ARTICLE
If you choose to read the manga, you probably won't regret it especially if you liked the movies/anime. It's my personal favorite, the only downside is that the author is taking forever to write the next chapter.
>> ARTICLE
I had the opposite experience. A friend introduced me to the films, which I thought were fantastic. I've been reading the manga because I liked them so much and it's just... incredibly dissapointing. It turns into directionless shonen drivel after a while. There are still "shit that's cool" moments, but not much compelling happens after the golden age arc. It reminds me of every other serialized 900 issue manga. I was quite let down.
>> ARTICLE
I like it more after the Golden Age, personally. Became a true seinen manga in my mind.
>> ARTICLE
I'll have to agree that yes, after the Golden Age Arc the quality dropped, but I still found it good.
>> ARTICLE
Given the Anime's cliffhangy ending, I'm surprised you haven't already rushed to read the manga! It's absolutely worth reading the manga, make sure to start from the beginning instead of where the anime leaves off, there's some things left out of the anime that are important to building character.

 Also be warned, it might be a bit jarring to go from the anime to the manga, after the Golden Age arc, a comic relief character is introduced, and this can be a little jarring given the show's dark nature.
>> ARTICLE
I started and finished Berserk this past week as well, and wanted closure so I tried the manga however I found that I really didn't care for [how the focused is towards supernatural/horror/demon compared to how the anime was 23/25 medieval fantasy](/spoiler)

I still have the the 3 movies to watch, but I have a feeling that I won't really care for more than the Golden Age Arc and the manga might not be for me. 
>> ARTICLE
It really does become more of a horror manga than medieval fantasy. I actually really liked that, but I can see why it might feel like a bit of a bait and switch to someone who started with the anime. In the Manga, there is an arc at the beginning that sets up the demon shit right away, but in the anime it starts from the Golden Age arc.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren 12/12**

I had high hopes going in after the first season, and I have to say that this was a huge let down. After I finished watching, I started reading the discussion threads here on /r/anime to see what other people have said, and it was cathartic to realize that I wasn't the only one that was disappointed. 

[Chuunibyou S2 spoilers](/s "After establishing in S1 that Rikka and Yuuta's relationship has progressed past friends, it remained stagnant for 12 whole episodes. It's like any form of character development was thrown out of the window. After 12 episodes, we finally get the big buildup to the kiss only to get blue-balled by the cliche phone interruption. But hey, at least Chimera had kittens.")

[Shichimiya Satone spoilers](/s "It's also usually not a good sign when your favorite character for a season is considered a side character.  I just felt so bad for her after episodes 9 and 10.  I'm usually a proponent for the canon couple, and even though I think Rikka and Yuuta are right for each other, I still think that Satone is more compatible. She has much more emotional growth than Rikka and even pushes Rikka towards Yuuta despite her own feelings. She's just a tragic character, and her arc was my favorite for the season.")

**Nanana's Buried Treasure (11/11)** (Watched 6-11 this week) 

This show was fun, but I think the lack of a proper ending ruined the whole enchilada for me. 6/10. Felt like a waste of time. If it gets a second season, I'll probably watch it but this ending just left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Meh.

**Monster (51/74)** (Watched 49-51 this week)

I don't know why but this show bores me for some reason. I love the story, but I seem to only be watched 3 or 4 episodes a week. Oh well. I'm almost done.... kinda. I hope to finish by the thread for the 27th. Mainly because I'll be watching season 2 of.....

**Fate/Zero (13/13)** (Watched 1-13 this week)

My co-worker/friend suggested this to me, saying it was 'the only anime he ever enjoyed.' Well, with him putting in his two weeks notice the other day, I realized I should watch it. This was great. That being said, I would have been so mad if I was watching this when it was airing. Total cliffhanger at the end of "Season 1." The whole idea of the show is awesome. I was genuinely surprised when [Season 1 spoilers](#s "Caster showed up and started acting so nice towards that kid, letting him go out of Ryuunsuke's house, and then BAM, Caster kills the kid. I was flipping out. So well executed."). Rider best girl. Can't wait to watch the rest!

**My Neighbor Totoro (Movie)** 

Only my second Ghibli movie since starting anime.  I'm starting to get the hype around these guys, they make fun movies. I really enjoyed watching it, but it seems like every Ghibli movie starts way too slow. That being said, it was fun! I'll give it a 8.75/10.

**Toradora!**: 9/10. Almost perfect, and easily my favourite Romance anime. Quite a feat since I don't usually like Romance anime.

**Madoka Magica: Rebellion**: 8/10. Still trying to process this one in my mind. What. The. Fuck?!

Currently watching **Gunbuster**, but that 80's animation and sound is making it very tough going.
>> ARTICLE
Toradora is probably my fav rom com as well. Loved every bit of it!

Madoka, I thought was absolutely brilliant. However, I don't think I can ever rewatch it because of the impact it left on my soul after finishing it.

I also did gunbuster this week. Try *80s*.

Oops, typo. Thanks for that.

Hey man gunbuster has great animation and it's a lovely show and story

The animation in Gunbuster is great but done in bursts with corner cutting in other places. Never noticed anything wrong with the sound. If you're watching the Blu Ray version you'll have the shitty re-done audio from 2006 though. Watch the [EtB] or [G_P] DVD release

I watched Rebellion on Friday, and after staring at my screen for over half an hour alternating between muttering and exclaiming "*What!?*", and sometimes following it with "*..the hell!?!*".

After I finished reassembling my mind I managed to find [this image](http://i.imgur.com/sxuUbY7.jpg) (**SPOILERS**) which I felt helped explain the ending.

Not exactly \*this past week* but what I finished this morning at 5:39 AM was **Cowboy Bebop**.   

Man, was it a blast. To be honest, when I first watched the first few episodes, I was sure the series could only be 12 or 13 episodes, since the visuals were so stunning there was *no way* they could keep it up without a massive budget. Except they did. Also, I loved [Spoilers]( /s "how very very subtle the romance was, if it was there at all. So much of the ending was left to the viewer's imagination, such as Faye and Jet's reaction so Spike's death.")    

I gladly give this a **10/10**. The episodic nature of the series didn't hold it back in any respect. If you haven't seen it, do. Its Sci-Fi is actually fairly plausible, and sticks to its rules. Guns don't have infinite ammo, and it's one of the very very few things I've seen that actually have RCS on spaceships.

**Maoyu** (12/12) It's only 12 episodes long, and it feels a little rushed.  It has a few interesting concepts, but the execution is off.

**Black Bullet**(13/13) It's entertaining enough, but the story line is obviously truncated.  A lot of the characters seem like canon fodder, for plot advancement, or for emotional manipulation.

**Love Live** (marathoned both seasons + ova)

First of all, *I don't really dig idol anime* and hell I even dropped Idolmaster, AKB48 and Wake Up Girls. But this one, well I'll be damned goddammit. After finishing first season, I definitely felt the labor of love Sunrise put into this. Season 2 toned down the drama but blasted away with tons of music which is damn enjoyable. You want to see anime characters dancing to pop songs and *having fun* while doing it (not to mention many of the songs in the anime is almost full length)? Look no further and watch this. Also, prepare some tissues when bracing S2.
>> ARTICLE
>Also, prepare some tissues when bracing S2.

Cannot overstate enough. It may not be the same for everyone, of course, but the show really did suck me in in that way.

Honoka's father scene at the end of both season accurately depicts what I felt during those episodes. I wasn't prepared for that and it instantly broke me right at that moment.
>> ARTICLE
Going to shamelessly cross post my /r/TrueAnime response

Didn't watch much this week because of the Dota 2 International, so all the time I had was sucked up by it or watching airing shows.

What I got around to

**Free! (12/12)**

It was...surprisingly good? I mean the fanservice was just as obnoxious as I thought it would be (seriously where are their nipples?), but the show still had that beautiful KyotoAni art going for it. The story wasn't anything too new, just the typical sports anime story of overcoming personal conflict with sports, this time the fear of falling off into obscurity and whatever the fuck is wrong with Haru. Not too much there but what is there sparkles.

**Nismemonogatari (3/11)**

Bakemonogatari seemed to be about 60% Arararararagi shooting shit with people, 30% helping the girls with their problems, and 10% creepy fanservice and weird stuff. Nisemonogatari so far has been like 50% shooting shit and 50% creepy fanservice and weird shit. I haven't gotten to the tooth brush scene yet! I'll keep trucking along through this, if only to see Monogatari Second Season considering how highly rated it is.

**Shinsekai Yori (1/25)**

Reminds me of that book by Lois Lowry, The Giver. Probably the whole simplistic village with very controlled method of how people advance in life thing. Gotta say, so far I'm feeling the hype. I love the art-style and the direction it seems to be taking, can't wait to see where it goes.
>> ARTICLE
The Giver is a great comparison for Shinsekai Yori; peeking into the darker side of a utopia. 
>> ARTICLE
**Monogatari SS**&mdash;In the middle of the Shinobu arc. "Are you Italian?" made me crack up and is probably my favorite line. I've greatly enjoyed all the stories so far. [Spoilergatari](/s "Really liked seeing Hanekawa and Senjougahara together. Hachikuji legal version. Sengoku losing her shit.") When I got into anime, I never thought I would enjoy watching people converse so much.

**D-Frag**&mdash;About halfway through this. I really like things with oddball, out of left field humor, and this show has it in spades. Every episode is full of laughs. Roka? Takao? I can't pick...

**Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko**&mdash;Only through the first arc. More Shaft goodness. [Spoilers -5](/s "I hope we haven't seen the last of Futon Erio.")

**[Oreshura](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=14749)**

I seem to be going through a period of watching harem shows, and Oreshura is one of the better typical harem shows. The show is nice enough with some mild drama, but I really was able to get behind the romance within it. The fact that it ends fairly conclusively helps, but overall the themes of self identity and being able to be oneself were very nice. It was a decent watch.

**8/10**

**[Futakoi](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=125)**

You ever watch a harem show and just think, I wish there were more girls, but the artists were feeling lazy? That's Futakoi for you. Basically, Harem 101 but each girl has a twin. Nothing out of the ordinary at all, but it was nice enough. Aged pretty well, considering it's from like 11 years ago. 

**7/10**

**[Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=4744)**

Basically, I watched this because I heard Rie Kugimiya was good in it. Pity the show around it was pretty pants. Stopped after 5 episodes.

**[Henneko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15225/Hentai_Ouji_to_Warawanai_Neko.) (rewatch)**

Henneko is one of my favourite harem type shows, mainly because it really isn't your typical harem. Yes, all the girls are after Yokodera, but we get a focus on one relationship pretty much from the outset. From then on in, Yokodera helping the other girls is always affected by Tsukiko. 

On a second watch through, the bread crumb trail of the over arching plot is much more noticable, and I appreciated how the show used that to really bring in the weight of said issue. I really got behind the central relationship, and I found it rather lovely how the series wrapped up. 

**8/10 added to pile of fluffy jumper shows**

Watching [**HeartCatch Precure**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7645/Heartcatch_Precure!) (finished ep 25). Decided to give this show because of the manga, [Shinozakisan Ki Wo Ota Shika Ni!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinozakisanKiWoOtaShikaNi), which they kept referencing it as PrePure. 

Surprisingly enough... I love it! It's essentially a kid's magical girl show, but with DBZ-like battles. That and I love the art style and transformations, despite the obvious merchandise advertisement lol. Cure Sunshine is ~~badass~~ cute too. *Real magical girls duke it out with fists!*

I've been really meaning to check that series out. I hear it's one of the better PreCures.

I was watching [Kanon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/144/Kanon), [Air](http://myanimelist.net/anime/101/Air), and [Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka). 

Kanon and Air were rather confusing and disappointing, not nearly as enjoyable for me as Clannad and they followed the basic ideas behind them. Plus they were just...confusing at times.

Hyouka is hilarious and good fun. I like the lack of dramatic drama in place for real fun and a bit of regular intrigue that you could honestly believe a bunch of highschoolers could have. If you aren't particularly interesting in over the top romance, drama, adventure, or the supernatural, give it a try. I'm not nearly done yet, but I'm really enjoying this change of pace. 

I'm also rewatching [Clannad](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2167/Clannad) and hope it lives up to my initial impressions.

Just finished Haruhi (Melancholy and Disappearance), and now I'm feeling empty inside, such a great show. 

So now I'm torn between GitS:SAC, Spice and Wolf, Nisemonogatari, Kuroko no Basket and Tatami Galaxy (the ones I can watch but have not begun) to fill that void, but I don't know which one to watch, so in the meantime I'm rewatching Madoka.

Watch Tatami Galaxy. It's a masterpiece, and almost none of /r/anime has seen it. It's a shame. 
>> ARTICLE
**Joshiraku** 2/13 - I'm certain about 90% of the jokes in this went completely over my head. But that's okay, because I still enjoyed it.  
Decided to watch this one cause of some picture someone put up somewhere on reddit(I think), and then someone recommended it to me when I wanted to watch something wordy.

**Shinryaku! Ika Musume** 1/12 - It took one gif to make me watch this. Just the one. I'd heard it before, but hadn't really a clue what it was about other than a girl who is a squid.  
I'll probably be slowly getting through this one, as there is a fair amount of stuff out there, OVAs, S2 and whatnot. It's about what I hoped it'd be though, so that's nice.

**Yama no Susume S1** All of it! - Prior to this season starting, I looked through the shows that were coming up, and saw S2 listed. I wasn't aware at the time that it was a short series, and I burnt through it all in one sitting. This was a really easy watch, and if you want something just to relax and watch, this certainly suits that bill nicely.

**Ai Mai Mi** All of it! - Same deal as Yama no Susume, at least in the reasoning for watching department. This was rather silly, and didn't make a single bit of sense. Pretty funny at times, definitely would suggest people give a look at these shorter series. I've so far found them more entertaining than full length ones, simply as I tend to get burnt out on 30-minute shows, and with about half of them they never get finished simply due to the commitment.

And not sure if this counts here, but I'm currently rewatching **Monogatari Series - Second Season**, and when I first watched it, I didn't find myself enjoying it as much as I had earlier seasons(particularly Bakemonogatari). With this rewatch, that most definitely isn't the case. Just a couple of hours ago finished the [Arc name spoilers, nothing more](/s "Shinobu Time arc"), and I only started this rewatch about 4 days ago, intending to go through maybe an episode each other day, to try and line it all up with Hanamonogatari starting up. That isn't quite working out.

I watched [NANA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/877/Nana). It was suprisingly interesting considering I usually don't like slice of life animes. The characters really pulled me into the show and made the anime a lot more interesting. It's a lot more realistic than other romance animes.
>> ARTICLE
I finally got around to finish fucking **[Binbougami ga!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13535/Binbougami_ga!)**  and it was actually pretty funny. HanaKana in a not shy role is always good, the little parts of drama were acceptable and the references were Seitokai no Ichizon level.

Deadman Wonderland and now Durarara!!! :P

**Ore no Imouto ga konna ni kawaii wake ga nai**  S1 + S2 + Specials (32 episodes)

I finally said 'fuck it' and dove into this series.  The premise was great and the Kyousuke / Kirino dynamic in season 1 reminds me so much of the Kyon / Haruhi relationship.  Haruhi is one of my top series so that was a great plus.  All the scenes of Kirino entering otaku mode were pretty adorable too.   

Season 2 though changed the dynamic entirely.  All of a sudden every single one of the female characters was inexplicably attracted to the MC even though they are all rich / super models.  What was a slice of life tsundere otaku comedy turned into a generic harem which pissed me off.  The ending was a total clusterfuck of wrong I should have seen coming.  Manami is the only girl in the cast with any sort of sense.  Overall though I liked it but the ending totally ruined it for me.

8/10

**Beyond the Boundary**  Last 6 episodes

This was a series Ive had on hold for the past few months but finally finished.  The last episodes had really great action but there was a bit too much hand-waving done about critical plot points for me to care about the actual story.  Still this series has great characters and fantastic animation (KyoAni) and I'm glad I finished it.  

8/10

**Log Horizon** 2/26

I've heard this series was really good but the first couple of eps seemed really generic.  Am I missing something?  Does it get good later?  I'm putting this one back on ice.

6/10

**Sengoku Otome: Momoiro Paradox** Last 4 eps

What's with all the rule 63 Nobunaga these days?  This is a light comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously.  I've always liked seeing how well normal people can fare in fantasy worlds and this one does it pretty well.  The ending was particularly satisfying.

7/10
>> ARTICLE
Man... Another manami bro. Hold the line. 
>> ARTICLE
Manami and Kuroneko are the only ships I see with any legitimacy.  The other 4 characters I just don't buy their motivation.  I heard Manami got a lot of hate for that confrontation at the end but she was 100% justified in trying to shine a light through that cloud of bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
Manami also gets a lot of hate for shit that was revealed in the LNs, which imo is entirely irrelevant to show watchers.

Log Horizon gets much better later on. At least it doesn't go SAO style. You do have to enjoy stuff like tactics and politics to truly enjoy the show.
>> ARTICLE
Really I haven't seen an MMO based anime since .hack but the genre seems pretty popular now with SAO, NGNL, and Accel World.  It made me want to try one of them but I might have chosen poorly.
>> ARTICLE
NGNL is not an MMO based game, that I can tell. It is really good anyway.

I found Log Horizon to be the best of the 3 you mentioned. In terms of story and characters, it is far superior than AW or SAO. It is has a very different tone from either of those since it is much more based on strategy and human interaction. It feels more "real".

If you prefer more action, AW is the next best choice, though many people don't like it. Finally, SAO, since it completely goes downhill after episode 3. This is personal opinion though. A lot of people can enjoy SAO even if it's story and characters are mostly not the best.
>> ARTICLE
>I've heard this series was really good but the first couple of eps seemed really generic. Am I missing something? Does it get good later?

Yeah, the first episodes are a bit generic with the pervy knight and the tsundere ninja and their quest of trying to save the loli, but it gets much better later on, and luckily those "hilarious" antics between those two stop soon.
>> ARTICLE
How much farther is the "later on" part?  This is a pretty common problem with series that are known to get good later on.  It's hard to tell when you should give up.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 5-6 I'd say. In episode 5 you begin to learn more about the world and the mechanics of the game, and episode 6 is when the big mindgames by the main character start happening.

OK,  that's same as what another poster said.

**Tari Tari**

When Tari Tari started airing I had lost my mother 4 months ago, which made me drop the anime. This week I decided to try it again. No regrets. **Tari tari is a fantastic slice of life** which I recommend to everybody who likes the genre. It has fun moments, sad moments, happy moments, ood music, good animation, nice characters.
>> ARTICLE
**Colorful**- Kind of surprised I've never heard of this until this week. Gets a bit slow in the middle, but it's worth it in the end. Not sure what else to add other than it got me, and I really enjoyed it. If you got a few hours to kill definitely check it out. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the entirety of **Kill la Kill** in 2 days. I always ignored it, casting it aside as a "Gurren Lagann with more tits", but it was an interesting ride. Not really incredibly awesome like the hype made it out to be, the main character had a lot of random power-ups that came out of nowhere and made it feel like a battle shonen which I didn't really like.

7/10
>> ARTICLE
I had lots of free time this week, which directly translates to 'I had lots of time for anime this week'.

1. **Hataraku Maou-sama [13/13]** -- Man I loved this show. It was perfect for me. The comedy and the characters were right up my alley; I liked how the jokes and gags were more inherently and genuinely funny instead of just goofy, slapstick, "everyone turns into a chibi to react" typical anime humor. If anything, I'd had wished that we would have gotten some more romantic development with either of the two female leads, but, I mean, it's not like I was expecting that to actually happen. **9/10**

2. **Working!!** and **Working'!! [13/13]** **[13/13]** **[REWATCH]**-- This little rewatch here got me to remember why I loved this show so much. It just has a certain lovability and relatability to its characters that no other anime does. On this second run-through, if anything, I noticed that it's much more tropey than I remember, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, even if the humor sometimes stumbled a bit. I found myself uttering "I fucking hate this show" one second and "I fucking love this show" the next, and that's pretty funny. Also both OPs were love. **8.5/10**

3. **Binbougami ga! [7/13]** -- Absolutely adoring this series so far. Love the comedy, love the abundance references, love the art style and character design. I really appreciate how the humor actually gets adult or contemporary, how it's actually funny and not just more slapstick anime humor (although there is certainly a very, very huge amount of slapstick humor in the show; it's just actually funny). Also loving the OP and ED, might be some of my favorites. Will be finishing this as soon as I can.

3. **Ga-Rei: Zero [2/12]** Oh God damn it [you guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ag28k/spoilers_tokyo_esp_episode_1_discussion/civ2ud8?context=3). And my week was so filled with comedy and happiness, too. Er, well, it's pretty good so far. Appreciate the well-animated action, like the character design. Also really enjoying the sound design, most notably how the sound of the fire was left audible as the credits rolled at the end of the first episode. That really made the impact of that first episode pack even more of a punch. If nothing else, I also have to give it props on how it's giving us action and blood and dark themes without falling into the whole angsty-teenaged-bullshit grimdark "I'm cool because gore" kind of category of shows. I'll be finishing this one in a bit.

I finished watching the Kara no Kyoukai movies, ufotable's animation blew me away and the characters and suspense was nothing short of thrilling, I'm giving this series an **8/10**.

Stein's Gate absolutely blew me away, the synergy between Okabe and Kurisu is one of the best I've ever seen in anime, the movie added another layer of complexity to Kurisu and showed us how far she and Okabe have come since the start of the series, overall I give both the show and the movie a **9/10**.

I'm up to episode 10 of HxH and I'm hooked, it was cool to find out that Sawashiro is voicing Kurapika, I plan to watch the 3rd Madoka movie because I've been putting it off for a while.
>> ARTICLE
Finished Gurren Lagann, then thought to myself-

*Man, Kill la Kill, Sword Art Online, and now Gurren Lagann? God I need something more emotional*

**Golden Time**

I enjoyed it a lot. It was a little unorthadox in terms of how I usually see romances work out, but I enjoyed it. Banri was a good character on his own, his *other* friend that tagged along with him was a pain in the ass and I absolutely hated him.

Koko was a bitch for the first 15 episodes, just saying that whatever character development they gave her they immediately ruined it by making her act like a bitch.

Side characters are side characters *except 2D-kun, who is best kun*. Some get annoying and the rest get little involvement in the story.

Plot is fine, will get annoying when you first hear about it, but it grows on you when you realize they do it realistically.

Story ends blissfully.

Kaiba 12/12

Amazing experimental anime that is ultimately about love and memories. Great themes explored. The only real problem I had was I was a little confused with a few things in the series but that might not be a problem with the series maybe its a problem with me being too stupid or not paying enough attention. I look forward to re-watching it in the future to maybe get even more out of the themes and hopefully understand it better.

8.5-9/10 Masaaki Yuasa is a god.

Trying to blast through **Gintama**. I have episode 103 on pause right now as I write this. So far, it's goddamn amazing. Everything that comes out of this show is somehow original, and it usually ends up being hilarious, and the parts that are supposed to be serious are also executed perfectly. It's just really great, there's nothing more to say. I can't wait to get to some of the episodes that people are always talking about.

Finished my re-watch of Oreshura, Masuzu's antics are helped by context from Jojo. The series is still both very pretty, using (it's pastel tones and thin lines to good effect) and uses it's characters well(using cliches in a fun, playful way), still have a strange love for that opening... 

Watched the first episode of Another, struggling to get a feel for it and haven't got attached because it feels far too forced.

Got to SAO and watched the first episode, nothing much to say except it's a start.

**Blue Exorcist (10/I'm on mobile and I forget how many episodes there were)** - watching this one because a friend wants to do a cosplay with me of the MC and his brother. It's kinda generic shounen stuff so far - kid finds out about secret powers, tries to figure them out while fighting monsters and going to school. There's nothing I particularly dislike about it, I'm still laughing every so often and I don't hate any character, but its not really jumping out to me.

**Katanagatari (4-6/12)** - I'm taking this one slowly and trying to soak it in as much as possible. I'm enjoying this one immensely. Every character is fantastic, the humor is great, and it just looks good. I was a little put off by the style of the characters at first, but its really grown on me. I love how Shichika is growing as a person, from killing the owner of the third sword just because she was the swords owner and didn't want to give it up, to recognizing the value of people's lives and sparing them. I look forward to see where it's going.

The only thing I'm a little disappointed in so far is the Maniwa corps. Each one could be a great character in there own, but almost none of them make it past one episode. A lot of the time, they just show up, get built up as a cool and intimidating enemy, and then immediately get killed and then the real fight starts. Right now, they seem pretty much useless beyond another force hunting for the swords, but I really hope that changes.

Also, what the HELL was episode 4?? They built up Shichika's huge fight and even animated it for the preview, then never showed it. But then they describe it in detail after its done pretty much just saying, "Man, wasn't that fight totally badass? It was so cool and you both had so many amazing abilities! I'm really glad you won." I had to laugh because it was just so absurd, I couldn't even be mad about it. I hear the ending of the series is truly a masterpiece, so I'm excited to finish this one next week.
>> ARTICLE
Although I agree that the Maniwa corps could have used more screentime, I will say one of my favorite parts about the show is how they managed to build very clear and ranged personalities for each member. There are many who only have a total of around 20 minutes screen time, yet they feel very fleshed out. A great example of this is the Insect squad, [Katanagatari Episode 4](/s "who feel incredibly fleshed out in the few minutes they are given before being murdered by Yasuri. I actually felt really bad for them and that scene had much more impact with those few minutes they used to establish character.") It really shows Nisio Isin's skills at characterization.
>> ARTICLE
Rewatching Evangelion and EoE. As always, spectacular, still catching things i didn't notice the first time through. On a lighter note, I also started Yuyushiki after finishing YuruYuri a little bit ago, and gosh this show is so adorable I love it, really hoping for a second season at some point. 

Also I haven't actually started it, but I plan to watch Humanity has Declined and FINALLY picking up Mushishi again, I could save those for next week's discussion, but i tend to blow through shows, so I may have finished them by then since it looks like I have all this week to myself!
>> ARTICLE
I'm slowly making my way through Revolutionary Girl Utena, but it seems to be catching its stride, so I may finally get through it after a couple of weeks of "I"ll watch ot when I feel like it."
>> ARTICLE
Watched Nisekoi, Black Bullet and No Game No Life these past few days.

No Game No Life was pretty fun to watch, bit too much on the ecchi sometimes but overall it was a pretty fun watch, sort of Deathnote meets games and magic in a happy setting.

Nisekoi, still dont really know what the fuck was going on in the show pretty much everyone was like i want to ask him out but im too scared to do anything fun for a few episodes but damn it gets annoying.

Black Bullet, fun to watch, plot was okay nothing really new though

  
>> ARTICLE
I agree, Black Bullet was completely mediocre.
>> ARTICLE
**Psycho-Pass** (ep13-end)  
Pretty good anime overall. I like this dystopian settings. I got quite the Death Note feel from this. Hoping season 2 can keep up with this! (Rating: around 8.5 rated as 9 on MAL)

**Ghost in the Shell** (movie 1)  
Liked this, but it was a bit too much things dragged into one film. I think I could have enjoyed it more if things were more talked about. A normal 12-24 episode show would be much better. (I don't know if the animes touch the same story or not). (Rating: 7.5, rated as 8 on MAL)

**Baccano!** (ep 1+2)  
This is... different. I didn't most of what happened in the first episode but I assume things will clear up. Nothing really much more to talk about right now.
>> ARTICLE
The first episode of Baccano is a recollection of the events that chronologically happens at the end of the series, with a kind of meta touch. It will all clear up soon.
>> ARTICLE
Currently about halfway through Psycho-Pass.
>> ARTICLE
Monster and already at episode 26 and I cant stop watching.
>> ARTICLE
Picked up Love Live at gunpoint.  It's fun enough, but the performance scenes switching to CG and back again half a dozen times is kind of odd to watch.


>> ARTICLE
ERABU.

I just watched [My Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering with My School Romantic Comedy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19221/). I really enjoyed it, 10 episodes of mindless fanservice and absurd comedy. 10/10
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Nagi no Asukara**. I can easily say it is one of the best drama series I've watched. 16/20.

Finally watched **Black Lagoon**. It is not my cup of tea, but it is a nice show nevertheless. 15/20.

Watched **Seikoku no Dragonar**. It actually isn't that bad^except for the tentacles . It had a relatively decent story and characters, and I liked the general concept. 13/20.

I'm now watching **BTOOOM!**, probably going to finish it today, because I like to suffer and wait for a second season that's never going to happen. So far a 16/20 but I have to finish it first.
>> ARTICLE
Went through and watched Neon Genesis Evangelion again.  I still have mixed feelings about it
>> ARTICLE
Finally watched kaichou wa maid sama and it was amazing! Pretty sad that there isn't going to be a season 2 though :(
>> ARTICLE
**Higashi no Eden (Eden of the East) (1/11)** Having seen only one episode, I can't comment on much, but I will say that I like it already. The visuals are pretty great, the character designs remind me of Honey & Clover(which is a good thing) and the premise is interesting. I also appreciate the effort put into the voice work, in that the English-speaking people are actually voiced by native speakers(though the writing quality of their lines varies quite a bit). I have high hopes for this.

**Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (The Tatami Galaxy) (1/11)** I've only seen one episode of this show as well, so once again I don't have much to say, but man this show is different. Looking at the premise and story alone, without regarding the characters or the crazy visuals, makes it look like the start of a very safe and generic romantic comedy, but I have a feeling that is really not the point of the show. The fact that the main character speaks at a headache-inducingly high speed is in itself a tell, as are the aforementioned crazy visuals, but even more than that, the show *feels* like it's about something entirely different. I actually don't know where exactly this show is going, and that's interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Episode one of Tatami Galaxy is insane. They throw you into an insane scenario at breakneck speed with absolutely no explanation for what's going on. It's an amazing show, but I didn't really love it like I do now until the final episode.

Also, you're spot on with the point of it not really being a generic romcom. The MC adresses it in the last episode, and it's one of my favorite lines in anime. 
>> ARTICLE
What do you think of the opening for Eden of the East? It's one of my favorite openings of all time!
>> ARTICLE
It is pretty great. The song is the best part, obviously, but the visuals are pretty interesting as well.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the middle of watching Shuffle. I like it so far.
>> ARTICLE
Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (6/12) - This has been sitting on my list for an absolute age, mostly because the premise sounded really cool. So far I'm not that impressed, there are a couple of scenes that are quite beautiful but the plot seems to be progressing so fast that I'm finding it hard to keep up with. It's just pretty meh to be honest...
>> ARTICLE
**Higurashi no nai Koro** 20/26 I picked this up on a whim after hearing about it as one of the best horror anime and the VN is getting an updated release on steam so it seemed a good time to pick it up.

So far the show has been excellent ignoring any DEEN quality I've enjoyed all the characters and story lines though I have a lot of questions in relation to it and what's going on. I hear the next season has the answers so that should hopefully help. 

As for the scariness it actually rather is with it giving me quite a few jumps and being generally creepy and off putting especially [spoiler](/s " when Rena goes all dead eyes and talks about being stalked by oyashiro-sama or in the first arc where her and mion keep getting possessed and getting cat eyes before confronting keiichi")
>> ARTICLE
Henneko BBS!

Legend of the Galactic Heroes

its quite fucking good but after having people praise it like the second coming of jesus every time its talked about I still kinda expected more
>> ARTICLE
Durarara! (currently at episode 22/25)-

This anime is gripping from the first episode, and ALL of the characters are really likeable and kind of scary at the same time. The storytelling is very well done too. I'm approaching the end, and the show still hasn't slowed down or dragged out anywhere. I wish I had tried this one earlier. 
>> ARTICLE
Mirai Nikki.
>> ARTICLE
Sword Art Online:  Damn this show started off strong and slowed down hard.  I don't think i'm gonna stick with it, to be honest it seems like a show i'd like, but i'm just not digging it. 

Currently watching Knights of Sidonia.  I'm enjoying this show quite a bit, seems pretty cool.  Animation framerate is kinda disappointing, and i can't seem to differentiate the girls at all, but otherwise its pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
Someone on  r/mecha posted Knights of Sidonia at 60FPS. 
>> ARTICLE
Im watching the netflix version.  The framerate isn't bad enough that i'd really try finding another version.
>> ARTICLE
I finally startet watching K-ON!, 5 episodes in and I love it so far! Feels good to know there is a second season with double the episodes and a movie and I'm just at the beginning.  
In addition I finished Hitsugi no Chaika which I first dropped after three episodes when it aired but now I'm glad i catched up because it was awesome and I'm looking forward for season two in fall.
>> ARTICLE
I finished full metal panic (fumoffu is just awesome). And I got 9 episodes into high school of the dead.
>> ARTICLE
Finally finished Asu no Yoichi Samurai Harem. 

Watched a bit of the great Boys Over Flowers.

I'm slowly working my was through the classic rom com Maison Ikkoku, I'm now in the 50s.

I'm rewarching the orig sailor moon to prepare to binge watch the reboot once it's all released. Just started the R season.

No Game No Life is the most recently released show I've watched this week.

Started watching Death Note this week. Just started watching anime this summer. So far I have watched, Attack on Titan, SAO, and Black Lagoon, So far I am enjoying it!

Gunsmith Cats, because it's awesome.

**Monogatari Series Second Season (10/26)**

So far I've been extremely impressed with this show, the characters have much more depth and there are quite a few really touching moments in the show so far.  Araragi has become my favorite MC, he has all of the traits of the stereotypical hero but he's also a very flawed person, which makes him feel much more human despite the fact that he is a semi-immortal ex-vampire.  The last arc I completed has definitely confirmed my feelings that Shinobu is best girl, her relationship Araragi is really cute.  Overall I think this season might be the best I've seen yet, I'm really excited for more.

**Selected Infector WIXOSS (12/12)**

I saw some people recommend this show saying it was underrated and noticed the second cour will be airing in the fall so I thought I'd give it a shot and I was reasonably impressed.  Sure its probably a bit over the top melodramatic at times but I thought it was quite an interesting character drama.  The ending of the the first cour was really good and definitely has left me wanting more so I'm excited for the conclusion in the fall.  I should probably go watch Madoka Magic now because it seems like you can't bring up this show without making the obvious Madoka comparison.
>> ARTICLE
With as full as this new season is it's been difficult for me to watch much else. I was able to get to a few things, however. 

**Kaze Tachinu (The Wind Rises)**  
Great story, well paced and full of emotion. Loved it.  

**Isshuukan Friends 6-9**  
I fully intend to finish this tonight or tomorrow, it's a shame I fell so far behind last season.  

**Origin: Spirits of the Past**  
I'd already seen this one before, but had completely forgotten about it. So when I saw some mention of it online it caught my interest again (I'm a huge fan of post-apocalyptic stuff with forgotten technology). It was as mediocre as I remember it having been though. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the entire series of C Money of the Soul and Possibility of Control in one day(favorite anime btw) and then the next day watched the entire series of The Devil is a Part-Timer. I have no life 9.9
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Bakemonogatari**. I had started it, but then put it on hold for quite a while. But then I discovered a Soundcloud [playlist](https://soundcloud.com/dakroz/platinum-disco-nisemonogatari) that had a ton of the popular full song versions of the OP's. After a few weeks of listening to it non-stop, I gave in and finished. I enjoyed it a ton more going back into the story than when I started out. I think I appreciated the dialogue driven aspect of it far more this time around. I'm excited to start Nisemonogatari.

I also watched **Hajime no Ippo**, and dear lord is that an awesome anime. I didn't particularly care for boxing, but my friend was always raving about the manga, so I gave it a shot. I've only seen the first 75 episodes and the movie, but it's just so good. 
>> ARTICLE
Got up to episode 8 of Ping Pong the animation as I didn't watch it last season. Pretty impressive so far.
>> ARTICLE
Akagi, it's Death Note with more table games and less death gods and blondes.
>> ARTICLE
**Ie Naki Ko 32-51 (END):** The tone in the second half of the show is very different; rather than a tragedy every other episde, it's more upbeat. Although I found that the tragic moments had more of an impact on me than all the happy ones, I think I preferred the second half. My main gripe with it would be the "plot by coincidence" that goes on, if that makes sense. So many characters just happen to meet other characters by chance, which shouldn't really happen since France is fairly large and most people are on foot. And all the instances of people just missing each other when trying to meet was frustrating to see.

Other minor niggles include the fact that Remi and Mattia can apparently speak English (or everybody in England can speak French), and that all strangers are just too nice. Sara had this issue too, so I suppose it's just a symptom of it being a children's novel.

**Jewelpet Happiness 30-36:** The plot that was hiding in the background has crept in quite quickly. The amount of humour in each episode has gone down as a result, but there are still a few perfect scenes each week. And finally, the cause of those pitfalls has been revealed.

**Isshukan Friends 9-10:** I'm trying to finish this before this season gets properly started. I can't say I like the drama that this new guy has brought with him at all, and it is probably less effective than it should be because I only care about Kiryuu and Saki. Why are the supporting characters usually more interesting in this kind of show?
>> ARTICLE
K On!/K-ON!!- Was halfway through S2 but the site I stream from had a massive issue that caused nearly all of the old videos to break. This means they have an ETA of a few months, and I've not found any other site with nearly as good mobile support so I put that K-ON!! on hold for now. I've been really enjoying it though- its got that perfect balance between comedy and SoL and when they actually play music its great music. The only fault I can think of is that some of the animation is pretty janky, especially when they are moving at anything faster than a walk. Looking forward to continuing when it comes back up.[](/sp)

In the meantime I've picked up Watamote. I find it hilarious so far, although at the same time it has some things that really annoy me. The biggest being that certain parts feel really "2edgy4me", and strike me as fan service designed for people who would insert as Tomoko. That being said, I'm enjoying it so far and I'm pretty sad it has so few episodes.[](/sp)

Not entirely relevant, but I'm planning on watching either Another, Kin-iro Mosaic or Infinite Stratos next. Any suggestions on which I should see first?

Non Non Biyori 4/12

Heard about it from a friend, decided to pick it up. Very nostalgia-inducing, great anime so far. Highly recommend to anyone that's looking for a fun, lighthearted series to cool off.
>> ARTICLE
Finally got around to finish Slayers. I absolutely loved this show, it was a blast from start to finish. I really enjoy the anime from the 90s, stuff like dragon ball, fushigi yuugi etc. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good adventure/fantasy anime.

I'm fairly new, I just finished Steins;Gate... It was one of the best shows I have ever seen. I haven't found anything that even remotely compares to it.
>> ARTICLE
I have been watching Code Geass, I just finished the 20th episode of season 2. As it is getting late, i will finish it tomorrow.

I realy like it so far, but I was rather disappointed with how they ended the first season, building up lots of tension and questions, and then just start one year later like nothing happened. They did explain what happened and it all makes sense, but i wish they had continued the story and not just done a huge time skip in the middle of the action.

**Ano Hana (11/11)**
Surprisingly, I didn't cry, though I did get pretty damn close at times. I felt like the whole love dodecahedron was a little contrived at times, but the whole concept of getting one last impossible chance with the girl you loved so much is heartbreaking. I did laugh at Yukiatsu at times, though. Not sure that was supposed to happen. 
Also, Menma is *adorable*.

The OP and the ED were great. I don't think I skipped the OP even once.
>> ARTICLE
* **Redline**: If you liked any part of TTGL, you'll love Redline. Why? They're the exact same principle, just in different settings. 8/10  
* **Hanasaku Iroha: Home Sweet Home**: It fills out the stories between the characters, and does it in a really sweet way. 7/10  
* **Parasite Dolls**: It felt like a few episodes of the Law & Order... And I fucking love Law & Order! 9/10  
* **Toaru Hikuushi e no Tsuioku**: Much more interesting than A Certain Pilot's Love Song. 8/10  
* **Cat Shit One**: WTB CoD mod with bunnies. 9/10  
* **Eiken**: I've made some bad decisions in my life. Eiken is one of them. 3/10

Shin Sekai Yori, Nagi no Asukara, and AnoHana

**Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo 10/10** 

I do have a soft spot for this kind of show (reminded me a tad of kokoro connect), well executed, had some minor flaws but it was very enjoyable. Really looking for some suggestions of similar shows.

**Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R1/2 10/10**

VIVA LELOUCH VI BRITANNIA, 10/10. why did I wait so long to watch this? probably because of the mechs, I normally hate mechs, but it didn't bother me in code geass, classic imo.

Finished Chaika. Watching now Hataraku Maou-sama (8/13).

I'm enjoying Hataraku Maou-sama quite a bit. I was expecting it to be something on the lines of Keroro, but oh boy was I wrong. I hope it does not flop on the ending like most series tend to do.

And about Chaika, it was a fun series to watch. I hope the story really picks up in the next season, since it barely got going.

Chaika.

**Wolf Children (2012 movie)**  
I had a few free hours at AX, so I decided to go see this film that I'd heard a few people gushing over in the past and boy, what a stroke of luck I did. It's a slow, plodding story, but that's what makes it so sentimental, for lack of a better term - it's a *good* story, and it's one that you don't mind rewatching just for the warm fuzzy of the brief moments of comedy and the interesting characters that it spins. Hana for Mom of the Year.

10/10, would rewatch

**Summer Wars (2009 Movie)**  
Y'know, I should really watch more of Studio Madhouse's work, because after Wolf Children and now Summer Wars their animation style is really growing on me. That said, masterpiece of a film - "family entertainment" isn't normally a label you'd apply to anime, movie or no, but this is definitely a film you can sit down and watch with anyone.

What I think I enjoyed most was the escalation of plot while maintaining the same core themes - the strength of family, in particular, but also the side symbolism provided by the Jinnouchi's history of standing up against overwhelming odds. Add in some sprinkles of very well-handled romcom and thriller elements and you've got a very well rounded and thoroughly enjoyable final product.

10/10, planning to rewatch (my brother'll enjoy this).

**Little Busters (1/26)**  
I was a fan of the VN, which I was unable to complete due to issues with typsetting in the English translation, so rather than digging through a million old torrents I decided to skip straight to the anime. So far, I'm liking it - a lot of the same fun quirks and characterization elements seemed to be preserved, even an episode in. Also, I adore the soundtrack (*everything* Key Visual does gets good music), so there's that.

?/10 (too early to call)

I've been finishing up Log Horizon.  Also, playing Transistor.  It's an awesome game.  Y'all should check it out.

Finished One Week Friends; didn't like the ending. Was hoping that at the end of a 1 cour show they'd be able to wrap it up with her not forgetting her memories, but nothing was really resolved. That's just how I feel. Art was still amazing and Fujimiya was still adorable.

Started Kyousougiga. What the FUCK was that episode 0. Then episode 1 kinda helped. Will most likely watch Episode 2 tonight.
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching a few animes. As of the last week, I'm watching:

Log Horizon - Was pretty interesting to begin with, but now I'm losing interest. The story definitely intrigues me, but it's a bit slow on execution and progress development.

Nourin - Started out well, but there hasn't been as much development as I would have liked so far. Albeit, I'm only at episode 4.

Outbreak Company - This one is pretty funny.
>> ARTICLE
With you on Nourin, finished that yesterday.
>> ARTICLE
Cutting down since I picked up a lot of series this season.

**Gintama** (30/201) - An entire episode fighting over sukiyaki? This is the first episode Ive found to be really amusing. The Death Note parody went over my head though since I haven't seen it.

The episode with the underground fighting ring and the orphans was touching. Revealed a good side to Sogo that I hadnt seen before. Glad to see the fallout from that with the rest of the cast in the next episode too. Oh, Sachan.

And then ew, cockroaches. The ogre hunting for the sword and running into Kagura was fun though, as was the crime mystery story with Otsu. No idea how many references I ended up missing there.

Also a new opening and ending. I already miss Mr. Raindrop. Overall it's still hit and miss, but I'm enjoying it more as I go along.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (8/64) - Barry the Chopper and the Slicer Brothers! I dont recall the former being so humorous.

**Beck - Mongolian Chop Squad** (1/26) - Okay start. Not overly fond of the animation or the individual voices so far but the dub does a decent job with the setting. Not sure how this one will go.

I'm also steadily advancing through the **Fate/Stay Night** visual novel, but I won't talk about that here since it's not an anime series. About 20 hours in and I'm really enjoying Saber's story; the VA for her also voiced one of my favorite characters so I'm enjoying that (Lafiel in Banner of the Stars, who even has a similar personality).

I just finished Death Note for the first time. Wow, thats about all I can say about it. The ending just killed me. Even if the second part wasn't good in my opinion, just the entire series as a whole was full ingenious plots, even if they were a bit far fetched. Still a great anime, 10/10

I just finished Mirai Nikki, that was pretty good, aside from a few nitpicks I had with the show. I really did not expect a lot of those twists! (also such a good first op, the others fell short)

I also rewatched Neon Genesis Evangelion, because I love the crap out of that shit, and finally got around to watching those Rebuilding Evangelion films, which were pretty sweet. I felt the third one was lacking compared to the previous two, but it was good enough for me to enjoy it and I cant wait for 4.44!

About halfway through both Nagi no Asukara and Shinsekai Yori. Both VERY awesome and intriguing so far. The art style is also fantastic! Would definitely recommend based on what I've seen, both 2 cour, so it's a bit longer.

Also, it's one of those shows that kinda blurs the line between anime and hentai

Finished: [Hataraku Maou-sama!](http://hummingbird.me/anime/the-devil-is-a-part-timer)

Went in with close to no expectations since I just wanted to see why it was mentioned on Hummingbird's [2013 - The Year in Anime Slideshow](http://hummingbird.me/2013/) so often. Easy to watch with standard but likeable characters. Actually hoping for a second season now

Started: [Suisei no Gargantia](http://hummingbird.me/anime/gargantia-on-the-verdurous-planet)

Started out of the exact same reason as for Hataraku Maou-sama! Only watched the first episode so far but I really like where this is going so far.

Also, I just found out that there's a [sequel](http://hummingbird.me/anime/jormungand-perfect-order) to [Jormungand](http://hummingbird.me/anime/jormungand). Holy crap. So I'll definitely start watching that, too.

Fate/Zero. I can't believe I had not gotten around to watch this earlier. It was absolutely amazing! I watched Fate/Stay Night quite a while back, and I know it's not a popular opinion, but I enjoyed it. Haven't gotten around Unlimited Blade Works yet, but it's on the shelf of things I need to watch.

Been watching **Gankutsuou** over the past week. I'm upto episode 18. It's a wonderful story and I love the way they've done the art style. The only issue is the character of Albert is so incredibly frustrating to watch. His naivety gets in the way of enjoying the rest of the story. Hopefully I'll be able to finish the series this week.

I'm fairly new to anime as a medium really. I started watching some stuff a couple months ago and have quickly fallen in love. Recently I was working my way through Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and I am loving it so fucking much. I'm on episode 57 right now so the end is just around the corner and I really don't want the ride to stop. Also was wondering is The Sacred Stars of Milos part of FMA Brotherhood or just FMA?

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** Ep. 38-64 [3rd Rewatch]
I normally like to rewatch shows 5 or 6 months after (re)watching them. This rewatch is pretty fun for myself mainly because the long wait had me forget about most parts of the show

**OniAi** Ep. 2-12
After looking around the subreddit /r/imouto and seeing a post of it, I really wanted to watch it because the very interesting plot. (story plot that is *cough* *cough*) But I am actually really enjoying this anime

**Mayo Chiki!** Ep. 13-13

I seen this one a recommended post here, wanting to check it out I actually quite enjoyed the show. I can easily say the characters are pretty damn likeable.

Dog Days 13/13 and Dog Days' 6/13.

Was a bit reluctant going in, but it really caught my attention after 3 episodes. Very nice anime to watch inbetween more "serious" series.

**Kyousougiga** - Man, I was really surprised by this one. Wasn't aware of it when it aired, and in fact had only just recently heard anyone talk about it. Heard good things from people I trust and decided to give it a go. 

First episode had me confused but *extremely* intrigued and by the time I got through episode two I thought to myself, "I think I've found something amazing".

Honestly thought I might end up finally giving a fourth 10/10 rating and breaking something into my top 5 after it's been left unchallenged for so long. In the end, I was *incredibly* happy with it, but it wasn't quite a show that I would call a masterpiece. **9/10**

- Bleach-(30/344) Watched 21-30 this week: Yay! Soul Society arc has started. Looking forward to seeing Ichigo kick some ass. I really love the new opening song, and I am looking forward to seeing how Ichigo will rescue Rukia. 

- Fate/Zero-(13/13) Watched 1-13 this week: Wow. Major cliffhanger at the end of Season 1. I can't wait to start Season 2! Animation was extremely well done, and even though the plot was pretty slow at the beginning, things have definitely picked up! 

- Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam-(22/50) Watched 21-22 this week: This one is a pretty good entry into the Gundam franchise. At times, the plot can be somewhat confusing, but I am looking forward to finishing it. 

- Black Lagoon-(12/12) Watched 1-12 this week: Revy is such a freaking bad ass! I liked this one, and I am looking forward to started The Second Barrage as well as the OVA.

**Danganronpa** 13/13

I got told about this shows a while back and it ended up on my watch list until finally this week I watched it and I am rather mixed on it. At first it was somewhat interesting and weird and then it's ending felt so sterotypical shounen that I dropped it's rating to a 5/10 .

**Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou** 12/12

I liked the sorta slice-o-life no school drama BS upbeat comedy and I loved Senpai's voice. leave it to Kana to be everywhere and all the while I still love her voice.

7/10


**Sword Art Online** 25/25

This is a show I actively avoided for so long but at least I also avoided any spoilers. The show started sooo strong and was really interesting up until the whole log cabin bit. After that was rather so so. I definitely understand why the reception is so mixed.

7/10

**Escha & Logy no Atelier:** 4/12

I just started this one so I have not gotten far but fantasy and its weird charm work for me.

**Date A Live II** 4/10

I almost dropped the show after ep 1 but at least it has gotten better. I liked the first seasons stupidness and s2 definitely feels right at home.

I downloaded Steins Gate.

**Katanagatari (12/12)**

Holy shit, I loved this anime. I was worried at first from hearing about how dialogue-heavy it was, but never once during the show was I bored. Also that ending was super epic and satisfying.


>> ARTICLE
When I first started watching Katanagatari I thought fuck me 50 minute episodes, but it turned out to be an amazing little mini-movie about each sword! Honestly the ending is one of the best I've ever seen in anime and I've re watched it a few times just to get the feels...

**Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works Movie** by Studio Deen.   

I wanted to see how it was since i just finished the route in the vn. I understand that they had two hours to cover a large amount of content, but their pacing was horrible.   

Things did not flow well,  even for people who haven't watched the latest version or read the vn. The moments that were suppose to be shocking were not foreshadowed beforehand,  so they come off as just a scene. 
>> ARTICLE
[mfw](https://i.imgur.com/rGldt3O.gif)

I'm sure this goes without saying at this point, but if you haven't seen their original anime adaptation yet, don't.

Unfortunately, I watched it 5 years ago. At the time, I heard it was decent and I really liked the concept/synopsis that I read so I decided to try it out. At the end, I thought it was ok, but nothing to write home about.   

A year or so later, I found out it was based off a visual novel and I started that. It blew my mind, even thought it was just the first route. Things I didn't understand were explained in the prologue, and it just got better from there.  

When I started watching Fate/Zero in 2013, I had forgotten all about DEEN's version (seriously. I have no idea what happened except for the Berserker fight and a small part of the CGI dragon scene). At this point, I don't remember anything but the UBW movie. Also, *don't * read the youtube comments for the movie. It will make your head hurt worse than the movie itself.

**K-On! (6-13/13 + Live House special)** - Finished up the first season of K-On and adored it. The comedy was well done and the cast really nailed their roles...Mio still best girl.

**K-On!! (1-9/26)** - Started the second season of K-On the day after I finished Season 1. So far, I'm loving it even more than the first. It feels like they took everything that made the first season special and expanded upon and improved it. Unfortunately had to put my watch on hold for the weekend (Modem burnt out and can't get a new one until tomorrow)

**The Devil is a Part-Timer!/Hataraku Maou-sama! (Re-Watch)** - With no internet, I decided to re-watch Devil, as I had been meaning to re-watch it lately. It was even better the second time, as I noticed several things I missed (In particular, a quote from Urushihara when Suzuno was cooking while Ashiya was sick: "Our Lady Ashiya of the floorboards") It would be a real crime if there isn't a Season 2 or continuation in my opinion. 

**Spice and Wolf/Ookami to Koushinryou (Re-Watching)** - Still with no internet, I had the urge to watch Spice and Wolf again. Only a few episodes in, but it's just as good as it was a few months ago.

**Barakamon(1-12)**

IMO a shining example of the difference between a well-executed show that does nothing new or interesting and a poorly-executed one. Barakamon's plot and character progression was as cliche as can be, but that doesn't mean that I didn't find it to be one of the most heartwarming and all-around best slice of life shows of 2014. I think that the calligraphy angle was a fun one to take, and reflecting a change in character in their art always works for me as a form of character development. I found the show pretty funny when it tried to be, and Naru's [mandom](http://oi62.tinypic.com/28009jl.jpg) gag was probably one of my favorites from this year. I smiled from ear-to-ear all the way through, and even my evil, grinchy, shriveled up little heart was touched by this one.

On a bit of a side note, can we take a second to appreciate how well the girl who plays Naru does in her role? I looked up the VA at about the 4th episode because I was like damn this VA has a really good child voice and was blown away when I found out that it was an actual child.

**Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru(1-12)**

Pretty solid until the ending. Not much else to say.
>> ARTICLE
Is that an exact copy-paste of what you wrote in /r/trueanime? I have no complaints, just wondering haha. 

I personally didn't find the mandom gag funny at all but I laughed at almost every other random thing they did. I also wonder how the recordings went at the studio for the child saying mandom over and over again. God that sounds absolutely hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
> Is that an exact copy-paste of what you wrote in /r/trueanime? I have no complaints, just wondering haha.

Word for word. There doesn't seem to be a ton of crossover between the two subs so I tried to pull a fast one. [MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/06/you-got-me.gif)

> I personally didn't find the mandom gag funny at all but I laughed at almost every other random thing they did.

It was easily my favorite gag in the show. [Barakamon](/s "The combination of the VA's delivery, Naru saying that the world is beautiful to her now while a bunch of frames that look liked they were watercolored are shown, and her butchering the second reading on the milk carton had me rolling.")

Finally got into Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Currently on episode 38, and it is quite good so far (I have not watched the original FMA).

I also watched 6 episodes of Sakura Trick; it's almost too sweet... :)

And finally: I started Gintama after seeing so much positivity about it especially in this sub. I can't really say much about it so far though, only 2 episodes watched but I like the humor.
>> ARTICLE

Be sure to take Sakura Trick in increments. Knew a guy who tried to marathon it, didn't turn out so well. On the bright side, we discovered that death by sweetness is possible.

I watched **Ping Pong** yesterday, it's truly a great show that is much more about friendship and hardship than about the sport itself.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished this watching this today! It was honestly one of the best anime I've ever seen and I absolutely adored all of the characters. The ending was also excellent.
>> ARTICLE
Every time I hear about that anime, I always think people are joking. An anime about Ping Pong doesn't seem serious or epic at all (though with that many people talking about it, it must actually be really good. No hate).
>> ARTICLE
Give it a go! Even if  you hate sports anime it's still a great watch because the show is first and foremost about it's characters.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I really liked Kuroko no Basket. It was also a good anime about friendship and teamwork, right?

I might give Ping Pong a try in the future.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't even really compare it to another sports anime because that's really not what it is. Ping Pong is more of a setting than a theme. It's about the characters first and foremost, they just happen to be ping pong players. You should give it a shot, it's definitely in my top 3 and maybe my favorite show of all time.
>> ARTICLE
I did not watch Kuroko no Basket so I wouldn't know.

The art style in Ping Pong is what seems to put some people off at first, but it does work very well with the show, [the OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZrm7e6Ly14) gives a pretty good feel for it.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished it for the second time this afternoon and only have two things I now can't seem to get. 

**SPOILERS**: When Ryuchi and his father are both asked who they play Ping Pong for why do they answer differently each time?

Also why does the coach from Kaio shout inaudibly three times throughout the course of the show? 
>> ARTICLE
The first time, he was having a real bro-to-bro moment with Sakuma, and he was kind of in his safe place so I feel like he was more open to sharing some more intimate details. When he's with his team just afterwards, he bottles his emotions back up and just throws out a generic answer that would be expected of him.

**Aldnoah.Zero (12/12)**

I went in with pretty high expectations, because everyone said it was good, and I was satisfied. 

One of the things I didn't understand, though, was why everybody hated Slaine so much. Now I understand. Fuck Slaine.

I really liked the music. I thought it fit very nicely. I also liked the setting and the art. Everything looked so interesting. I can't wait for the second season.

**Tokyo Ghoul (At the time of writing this 2/12)**

I normally don't really like ghore/horror stuff, but I've been enjoying it.

It will be interesting to see his role in the Ghoul and Human community.

**No Game No Life (3/12)**

I've been rewatching NGNL because /r/nogamenolife is having a rewatch, and I've been enjoying it a lot again.

It's still one of my favorites. I just love the badassery of [ ]. I love the artstyle too. 

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (3/12)**

Forgive me /u/BanjoTheBear, for I have failed you....

I try, and try, but it's just so *cringy*. I had to stop episode 3 in the middle of it because I just couldn't take it anymore.

But I still really like it, Rikka is just so cute.

**Death Note (6/37)**

This one is really interesting. Everyone always says it's good and I've been enjoying it.

Light is a genius psychopath and L is an awkward genius detective. It's a perfect match.

I absolutely despise both the OP and ED though. I really don't like them.
>> ARTICLE
> I try, and try, but it's just so cringy. I had to stop episode 3 in the middle of it because I just couldn't take it anymore.

It's very silly in the beginning (which suprisingly worked pretty well for me) but halfway through it finds it focus on the actual characters and the depiction of their emotions. They are 14 year old teenagers after all.
>> ARTICLE
Aldnoah.Zero's music was done by the same guy who did Attack on Titan, Hiroyuki Sawano. He's got a good in-your-face style to his tracks, and is currently my favourite anime composer. However, Ken Arai, Parasyte's composer seems really promising. Parasyte has my favourite soundtrack for now, I've been listening to it all day.

Sorry, went a little off topic.

That's part of the fun! Getting through the cringe, respecting Rikka's wish to act a certain way, seeing her act adorable, watching her struggle with her emotions, etc. You can do it! :3

> But I still really like it, Rikka is just so cute.

[Too true! :D](http://i.imgur.com/ajBV4ec.gif)

I believe in you, Mister! For if you believe in me, Rikka, and Chu2Koi, anything is possible! :P
>> ARTICLE
Yo, I saw it because of your recommendation as well and I really just have to thank you! I did not expect it to be so emotional and I really enjoyed it. Rikka is the best    
Would you give the same recommendation for the second season? The reviews on it were a bit negative and I'm hesitant as to whether I should watch it or not.

I shall watch it! I shall complete it! And most important of all, I shall enjoy it!

I've been watching **Nichijou** and **Hunter x Hunter**. I must say I'm highly impressed with both as both are outside of my usual genres. I have yet to watch an episode of Nichijou where I wasn't in tears from laughter. Hunter x Hunter simply continues to get better and better with each episode. To anyone that has had doubts about starting either one of these shows, just shut up and do it. You'll be glad you did.
>> ARTICLE
a warning about Hunter x Hunter is the chimera ant arc will punch you in the feels repeatedly towards the end so keep some episodes of happy shows like Nichijou or something similarly enjoyable to help recover from the feels.
>> ARTICLE
Oh geez.. I'm on episode 65, a little after the start of the Greed Island arc. How far until I'm hit with the feels? _
>> ARTICLE
Another heads up, although all my favourite episodes of hxh come in the Chimera ant arc, this arc in general has a pretty slow start. So just dont expect it to be amazing and mindblowing straight from the get go

Don't worry, you're only about half-way there. The Chimera Ants arc is huge.

I finished **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann** yesterday. For some reason it was on my plan to watch list for 6 months. That's 6 months too long.
>> ARTICLE
You should put Gunbuster on your PTW list, seeing as you like both Eva and TTGL. The influence it had on those two titles is huge (introduced a lot of mecha tropes too. Plus, it was directed by the one and only, Hideaki Anno. 

If you like Demo D+, he has a [video up about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnhvIevakZY) that goes more in depth into why it's worth a watch.

Gurren Lagann really is awesome though, I'm rewatching it again with my bluray copy I got recently and I still just love it. The recap movies, espcially the second one, are awesome too. The final fight is even better in it.
>> ARTICLE
Cool, added it to my list.
>> ARTICLE
Should also mention there's a sequel called Diebuster, it's not exactly neccasary since Gunbuster ties everything up nicely, but I kind of feel it completes Gunbuster in a way. It's 6 episodes long like Gunbuster. It's a very different show but it's still awesome and definitely worth watching after Gunbuster.
>> ARTICLE
Will do. I'll probably get started on it tonight. Thanks for the suggestion!
>> ARTICLE
You're welcome! I personally think it's best watched in one sitting, like a 3 hour movie. It takes a while to hook you in but it's all worth it for those last glorious three episodes. And I should point out that, yes, the last ep of Gunbuster is meant to be in black and white. I was confused about it when I first watched it, so I'm just letting you know in advance. You get used to it anyway.
>> ARTICLE
**Kara no Kyoukai**

Just incredible, first I felt a bit lost because the first movie was confusing as hell but after watching the rest it made sense and made me rewatch it. And holy hell, movie 5 must be one of the best anime related media I have ever watched. The animation were also beautiful and god damn the OST...

**Tokyo Ghoul**

Pretty good, I just wish they showed a bit more of the side characters and a bit more development of the main char because he doesn't really change till the last episode (daym son that episode) and somehow  obtained insane dodging skills somewhere in the middle. I haven't read the manga yet, everyone says its better but I guess I will read it after watching season 2 even though I can't wait any longer
>> ARTICLE
The Tokyo Ghoul manga has a lot of little moments the anime skipped that help develop the characters and explain things. Also by the way it looks like the anime is going 100% anime original for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Watched quite a bit, mostly over the past 10 days, and also might mention some stuff I've watched over the last couple of months.

**The Pilot's Love Song / Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta Episode 11's final scene to episode 13:**

I've watched episode 12 originally back on March 24th. For my "tying up loose ends, specifically from 2014", I've decided I'll watch the finale, and revisit the penultimate episode. My memories of that time were confirmed both by the write-up I've read again and the content itself - episode 12 was a proper "finale", with characters coming to terms with how they feel, saying goodbye, resolving the setting's conflict. So why was there another episode? What could it possibly give us? Well, for the first time, I set out to find out...

...and it turns out episode 13 gave me two scenes where Ari's face was actually drawn by an artist, not by the artist's 5 year old kid ([and it was actually pretty](http://imgur.com/a/4VKal), though it almost looked like a far older character), and a scene that made me tear-up, because [spoilers](/s "Chiharu was crying with Mitt-chan's parents, telling them he died"), but that was super raw, and hurt because we were hammered by The Sad. There was also the fact we were told the shape of the world, but they didn't actually give us cause to be invested in the world in this series.

It was a super needless episode, with them using basic (in the bad way) highschool storytelling shticks. The show had solid drama at times, but somehow it just didn't know what to do with it, and messed up the story of revenge and forgiveness with a nonsensical jumble of jingoist messages about war, and a too-large cast, and an art department that aside from backgrounds stopped actually drawing anything. This show had potential, but it ended up being the worst show I've actually finished this year. 5.1/10.

**Hyouka episodes 1-16 (including episode 11.5):**

I'll start this with three webms I've made from the show:

1. [The smallest of moments, at the club.](http://a.pomf.se/xxkpzf.webm)

1. [Houtarou finds a soulmate](http://a.pomf.se/idvimr.webm), or at least someone to put on a pedestal.

2. [A small non-moment of tension between a boy and a girl](http://a.pomf.se/onygxd.webm).

This is KyoAni's mastery, it is in the smallest of moments, not the big ones. Do you know what made me realize how *comfortable* I am with this show, how close I am to the characters? Do you know what the most distinctive sound for me in this series is? If you've guessed it's the sound that plays when Chitanda's eyes sparkle after she says "I'm curious!" then you've got the second place prize. The correct answer would be Houtarou's small "Hm", that almost cough, that he uses to orient himself, or after drinking some coffee.

Houtarou feels like a real person, they all feel like real people. Not because of any specific detail of their personality, not because of the broad brushstrokes of their character, but because of how *physically present* they are. They feel like people who actually inhabit the world.

Now, about the show, and it's getting late so I'll be a tad briefer. The first arc, and especially its conclusion were very good. That scene as they all sat in the room, staring at their feet, because looking up and admitting they shared that realization just hurt too much, was far too *awkward*. And yet Chitanda, the one from whom they felt the most awkwardness in that scene, needed it spelled out. Houtarou begins the series by reminding one of Hikigaya Hachiman from OreGairu, and then he truly delivered - saying what needed to be said, even as no one else would.

The movie arc was, well, not the best. It wasn't bad, and neither is the Festival arc (one episode left in it), but they're not great, not as great as the first was. And of course, the focus is on the characters, not the mystery, on Ibara and Satoshi trying to find their place in the third arc, and Houtarou being manipulated into abandoning his Grey Life for a while, and then ending as "truly colourless" when he loses faith. An interesting thought is that I often think of Satoshi as having the "MC personality", and Houtarou has quite a few "Supporting character" moments, and it's finteresting to reverse the thought process about that.

Edit: Oh yeah, I forgot I wanted to make this point. Never been a fan of Sato Satomi as a voice actress. Still not enjoying her as Chitanda Eru, here. Kayano Ai as Ibara is doing a *great* job though.

**Samurai Flamenco episodes 13-22:**

So, I've watched this show as it aired, but doing three write-ups on Thursdays those two seasons (Nagi no Asukara, Samurai Flamenco, Kill la Kill, and then in Winter 2014 we've also had Gin no Saji S2) just became too much, and you know how it is - when you fall behind, you keep falling behind, especially if you tell yourself you need to do a write-up on each episode. But here we were, the end of 2014, and I needed to finish this show so it could have a shot at my top shows list!

I didn't succeed in fully marathoning it note-less, and took way too many screenshots (because since watching the show I've learnt how to quickly take screenshots rather than do it slowly). [Here are the notes for episodes 13-22](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/samurai-flamenco-episodes-13-22-notes/), in case anyone's curious. But I did it.

Before watching it though, I re-read my notes for episodes 8-12 or so, and was reminded just how *brilliant* episods 8-10 had been, with the "We're evil too!" speech from the mooks, the nature of evil by King Torture, the "Greater Unification Theory" that's seen across villains in numerous shows, or even my theory about the "in-verse author-God."

Sadly, reading those notes, I also saw how episodes 11-12, though they contained many entertaining and ridiculous moments from my Super-Sentai youth (much of it from the first season or two of Power Rangers, I'll freely admit), just sucked all the energy out of this show.

Thankfully, episodes 13+, while still batshit crazy, [episode 18 spoilers](/s "even evoking both Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann's episodes 25-27 and Neon Genesis Evangelion episodes 25-26") in a single episode that was still 4 episodes from finish, returned the show to its previous manic levels of energy, and back to the theme it never abandoned - the pursuit of justice and heroics, even if it no longer dealt with it in a super-realistic manner as it did up to roughly episode 7 (stationery and all).

Thematic discussion, more coherent thoughts? I'll need to let it rattle around in my head some more, but it's been a splendid experience. 7.5/10? 8.9/10? It's so hard, and almost meaningless to try and frame this show that way. It has lots of flaws, and it's not a "perfect show, in spite of its flaws", as Kyousougiga is, but it was, and is, great. Sometimes that word has to stand for the material, until you can find several hundreds of other words to replace it with.

**Monogatari Second Series episodes 1-3:**

I've watched most of Tsubasa Tiger as it aired, then remembered it's best to wait for BD releases with _monogatari, which is how I've watched Bake, Nise, and Neko, and because I was watching way too much stuff at the time as is. So I've waited. Then I was busy, so the show waited some more. Approaching the end of 2014, I realized the dearth of worthwhile shows to list on my top shows of 2014, and I always considered Hanamonogatari to be part of the series proper, pushed off due to Shaft's infamous production mishaps (such as how it was supposed to air after Nisekoi's 20 episode run ended, remember?).

When Senjougahara cried, that her voice actress, Saito Chiwa, also voices Homura was impossible to ignore. Aside from that, she did a lot of work here. This is a series mostly told through talking, so a character's speech patterns are quite important for passing out the sort of character they are. Senjougahara keeps saying the other's name and speaking in very short sentences. She's direct, but also one who seeks constant affirmation, who can't let go, yet is afraid to get too close.

I don't actually have a lot to say about it up to here, [but I'd like to recommend everyone watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LsMoUtBlDk), that the tiger always makes me think of. That video is amazing.

I wanted to marathon the show, for the top shows ending in 2014 list, but after a couple of episodes I remembered why I could never watch more than an arc of Monogatari at a time, and generally no more than 2-3 episodes at a go. It has too little plot, and the plot it has takes too much air time. That's not criticism on the show itself, but it runs counter to what I need to be able to marathon a show, which is for it to be plot-driven, or at least have its plot more presence as a vehicle for the characters. That's not the case for the more atmospheric and almost relaxed Monogatari series, and it wouldn't do to force it, so expect Monogatari series updates for at least a week, if not two, to come.

**Little Witch Academia:**

For Christmas, apparently, Trigger had placed Little Witch Academia on their YouTube channel again. I've retweeted it and directed it at my older friends with kids who aren't part of the anime scene, and then realizing it's been far too long since I've watched it myself, sat down and watched the entire things again.

Well, what can I say? "Remember, magic is believing!" and "I believe! Mekmur, Mikmur, Mektoral!" just cause my eyes to water up every time they come up. It's a show about the magic of being a child, the magic of believing in magic, the magic of an adventure. And watching it transports me back to that era as very rarely media succeeds in doing, and for that, I love this little film, each and every time I watch it.

[Continued in Replies. I already ran into the character limit.]

**Death Billiards:**

Working on my [Winter 2015 season preview](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2014/12/30/winter-2015-anime-season-preview-and-expectations/), I noticed Death Parade as being based on Death Billiards, and that it ws a 25 minute anime short. I turned to AniTwitter, asked for advice, and have been told it's worth my time. It helped that with a bit more digging I found it's not an alternate version (as Kyousougiga), but based on, and that it's a stand alone.

It was definitely very interesting, but more than it reminded me of anime in general, it reminded me of indie comics, or the shorts I used to watch in the yearly cartoon festival that was held around here, with award-winning animated (mostly non-anime) shorts from around the world. It *was* somewhat thought provoking, but not nearly as much as it would've wanted to be, and often more about the "surrounding structure" of the bar and such.

[spoilers](/s "With how we've seen the old man's youth involving criminal activities, and his "quite evil" grin after the young man broke down in tears, and the young man changed directions"). So they want you to enter a "Princess or the Tiger?" sort of situation, and this feels exactly like a short story you'd read in English class and then get a paper asking you who went to heaven and who went to hell, or perhaps whether both of them went to one direction.

But at this point it's way too arbitrary, and even in a short story where you're supposed to make do with the details given who are all "uber-relevant" and no others, it feels way too arbitrary. As such, and especially when thinking of the show about to come, the focus is never about heaven and hell, and where the characters would end, as that's not only beyond our ken and arbitrary, but not really interesting.

What's interesting is humanity, and the humans it's made up from. What matters is what the characters did when they lived, and what they'll do now, when they're faced with a ridiculous game, and when their eternity is up in the air for grabs. What will humans do when their *human essence* is what's being measured, which forces them to strip down to their raw essentials? It's a story about humans in extreme conditions, and about their lives from before. It's a story, like all stories, about what humanity is. That's why I actually like death-game shows, as aside from the action, the stake-raising is exactly about exploring that aspect of humanity - *under pressure*.

It was interesting to think about, but sort of half-baked. I gave it about 7.8/10. Definitely worth the 25 minutes' price of entry.

**Me! Me! Me! short:**

I tweeted my impressions of this short on twitter. I think that was the most fitting way to treat this very interesting... thing. Well, here are the tweets. I don't really have anything more to say about it :P

First part felt like the stuff nightmares are made of, especially the oppressive audio-visual mixture. Heavy disturbing stuff. As someone who used to have nightmares he'd wake from with like 150-200 BPM, and who recalls them, I can tell.

Second part tried to call forth an emotional and emotive resonance, but utterly failed. Music wasn't "chill" but "bland". But the third part was just trash. It didn't even try at that point. Beautiful trash, like Redline, but still trash. And although the NGE callbacks were everywhere, it was a lot more like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

What was weirdest was how I actually had some callbacks to Eternal Sunshine in the 2nd bit, but what I felt was the biggest inspiration? Catherine, the Atlus game. It felt like someone wanted to do a Catherine-inspired anime short, and just stuffed everything in there.

So, Me!Me!Me! Had one part that was disturbing in a good way, one part that failed but tried, and one that was pure nonsense-trash. Also, much twerking was had, oh yes siree.

**ToraDora! Episodes 1-6, 20-25:**

December arrived, and with it the /r/anime ToraDora rewatch, and people on AniTwitter besides started humming the ToraDora theme, or mentioning it, and then I listened to all the ToraDora OPs/EDs. Guess I'll have to start with that.

[First OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAXwSiN0tto) - The words really fit, that short segment around 50-54 is one of my favourites, and I really love the beginning. It's an ear-worm kind of tune, and above average in its poppiness. Really good opening segment.

[Second OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crAPDlMB8gQ) - The first segment, the first 15 seconds, is just so *perfect*. It might be that it's tied to the content I like, and well, how *silky* it sounds, but it gets me a tad emotional listening to it. The slight tinge of longing as the song keeps going, even as the rest is quite poppy make me like this OP quite a bit. Still, it's all about those first few seconds. It probably doesn't hurt I skip most OPs/EDs, so it's the first few seconds burnt into my psyche, and not the whole thing.

[First ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygs_ITqX8bE) - Eh, not my thing, it's trying a bit too hard, the saccharine feeling is a bit too cloying. A lot of it is that beat playing at the beginning, though even as it stops, that song is a bit too "modern pop" for me, and forgettable. Like its content, it's just too *sweet*.

[Second ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLQg0P0W6y4) - ;_; Oh my, where was I? Ahem. Remember what I said about the second OP? This song's actual sound and content don't really matter. Just like Nagi no Asukara had a really good "ED Bleed" in very emotional scenes, so did ToraDora, when the second ED is involved. Hearing the first few seconds just brings forth a Pavlovian reflex of emotions rushing forth. I think the rest of the song is quite alright too.

So, I'm not yet ready for a full rewatch. I've always thought the early episodes of ToraDora, where it comes across as yet another RomCom with the Tsundere Queen are its weakest, and I still think so, and I still think the ending is incredibly powerful, and it certainly leaves me in tatters every single time. All those final confrontations. And yes, after "The Final Confrontation!" there's always another one, especially when you're young and in love.

**Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukanai (Haganai) episodes 1, 12. S2 episode 4:**

After watching ToraDora for a bit, wanted to watch the other dude with "bad reception" due to looks. Watched first episode for that moment, finale [S1 ep 12 spoilers](/s "for the "Sora and Taka" scene"), then revisited S2 episode 4 for [the funniest moment in the series](http://a.pomf.se/mhgbxh.webm).

**Shigofumi episodes 3-12:**

I'm not even sure what brought it up this time. Did someone mention this on Twitter? Was it me? Was it the RightStuf end of year sale that also contained Shigofumi?

I don't know what it was, but there's a reason Shigofumi is my most-watched anime series. I skipped episodes 1-2 because they're etched onto my mind at this point, and though I sometimes skip Fumika's story, especially the last two episodes, while rewatching the show (because I usually don't plan to rewatch it, I tell myself I'll watch "Just 20 mins, my favourite moments!" and end up rewatching 80% of it anyway), I did watch them again. This show isn't perfect, but it always gets to me, and it's my most rewatched anime series of all time for a reason. In case you don't know, Shigofumi is one of my favourite shows, and last year I've had about 5 people watch it because of me (about 2-3 on this subreddit). I strongly encourage everyone to watch it. Just make sure to watch the first two episodes together.

**Durarara!! episodes 1-12, skip-watching 13-24.**

[This is my post on Durarara!!](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2014/04/14/durarara-the-sound-and-fury-of-life/), and I even touched on it [in this post](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2014/12/14/12-days-of-anime-moment-12-connecting-to-the-world-via-durarara-i-am-not-a-violent-man/), for my 12 days of anime from 2014. The long and short of it is that I've watched episode 7 of Durarara!! about 8 times this year, and the first 12 episodes of the show, in some configuration or another, roughly 4 times this year. It certainly doesn't help matters that every time someone I know mentions the show (and one of my best real life friends is watching it now, based on my recommendation, and how he and his girlfriend also liked Baccano!), I just find myself describing what I like about the show, and then end up rewatching what makes me like it.

What makes me like Durarara!!? What do I like about it? That it makes me feel connected to the world, by how all the characters are interwoven, how the plotlines are interwoven, and how Ikebukuro feels *alive*. And the only real way to get that is to watch the first half of the show, so I did. Again. I also revisited bits and pieces of the second half again, which I don't like as much. I suspect the upcoming seasons will be closer to the 2nd half, but it's not that I don't like it, just that it's not as stunning as the first half is.

And man, that first half. It makes my heart soar.

**Code Geass S1 skip-watching episodes 3-12:**

Someone posted an image of Spin-Zaku, while rewatching Code Geass or watching it all for the first time, and there I was, rewatching some episodes, seeing Lelouch being awesome, Suzaku meet Euphie, the usual, the usual. And then I always find myself going "Dammit, where did my last 5 hours go?!" - For those who wonder, Code Geass is my 2nd most watched anime series.

**Kuroko no Basket (8/25)**

I thought I'd never like a sports anime, but boy was I wrong. Really intense episodes, even if the plays are a bit exaggerated. Hopefully I can finish this and the next season just in time for the 3rd! 8.5/10 so far.
>> ARTICLE
It really is a great show, but they exaggerate the shounen part of it and almost let it look like bleach in the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Hellsing Ultimate** last night. Gritty and gory, I had a fun time watching it.
>> ARTICLE
You should watch Hellsing Ultimate Abridged if you haven't yet.  It's hilarious.

Alucard is such a great character... I loved watching Hellsing Ultimate and really enjoyed the Generals ~~I Love War~~ speech.
>> ARTICLE
I started **The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya** (7/14) (Broadcast order).

Really liking it so far. The club is very entertaining with how they all interact with each other, and Kyon is a great narrator with a dry sense of humor. Looking forward to having some things explained later in the series.
>> ARTICLE
I would've recommended chronological order first, but as long as you're enjoying it, I guess that's all that matters. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a classic in my book, but I'll tell you two things now.

1) You have to watch all 8 episodes of Endless Eight at least one.

2) You gotta re-watch in chronological order eventually.

**Monster** (44/74)

This is definitely becoming one of my top 5 anime series of all time, hands down. I really enjoyed the last few minutes of episode 29, finally seeing [spoiler](/s "Johann's evil manipulative side for the first time. Him hitting Richard right in the guilty conscience was so fascinating, in a dark sick way.") Seriously, this whole show is mindblowingly fantastic. I have a hard time not marathoning a boatload of episodes in one sitting.
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently up to episode 40 myself and [spoiler](/s "Johan has already easily become my all-time favorite anime villain, especially in the last dozen-or-so episodes where we've seen a lot more of him. The show's not called 'Monster' for nothing after all.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm totally with you. Johann is probably one of my favorite villains ever, actually. I like how they took the Jaws approach with him. Everyone talks about Johann, but you hardly ever see him up until 25-ish episodes  into the show. It creates this really nice buildup. And, no spoilers, just wait until you get to the 44th episode, the ending is great.
>> ARTICLE
**Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's** **(131-154/154)**  
I finished Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's today, I have to say it was pretty good.  Came in expecting card games on motorcycles, was not let down.

**Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya** **(5/10)**  
Since I heard a new season's coming up, I decided to watch this show.  Artwork is really good, and who doesn't like Mahou Shoujo lolis?

**Seitokai Yakuindomo** **(8/13)**  
I saw a lot of links on /r/anime to this show, so I decided to watch it.  It's really funny, with tons of sex jokes.

**Kara no Kyoukai Movies** **(7/7)**  
With the first cour of UBW now done, I wanted to see some of the other work by Type Moon that ufotable has adapted.  The movies were awesome, especially 5 and 7.  Shiki best girl.

**Mirai Nikki** **(26/26)**  
Marathoned the show over 3 days with my brother, I didn't really like it.  The characters were weak, and there were a lot of plot holes.

**Tsukimonogatari** **(4/4)**  
I loved this arc.  It was nice to have a change from Araragi helping others, to Araragi getting some development himself.  Plus there was tons of Shinobu and Yotsugi cuteness.

**Carnival Phantasm** **(5/12)**  
Pretty fun spin-off series.  I'm putting it on hold though, as I haven't watched Tsukihime yet.

>> ARTICLE
Don't watch the Tsukihime anime, instead I recommend you either read the visual novel or the manga.

* **Durarara!!!**

> Amazing show, didn't expect such a great story and it was explained so well through tons of perspectives. I watched it mainly because there's a season 2 coming out so i gave it a try and i'll say it was well worth my time. Great characters, great twists! **(9/10)**

* **Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom**

> Also an amazing story but with a bit of stuff left to explain. Imagine you're at wrong place at the wrong time and an organization is killing someone right next to you and then they brainwash you and turn you into an hitman.. that's right, this main character doesn't remember anything at all and he's taught how to shoot a gun and how to kill people without leaving a trace. Great characters as well, unexpected turn of events and a solid story. **(9/10)**
>> ARTICLE
I started Glasslip. I quit halfway through..........the first episode.

I've started and completed Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun. It was pretty good, but definitely needed a lot more Yuzuki.

I've begun the Seitokai Yakuindomo OVA. I find it kind of odd that they're introducing new characters in the OVA, but what can you do.

I also completed Daily Lives of High School Boys. Honestly I was kind of disappointed. There definitely was some good material in this show, don't get me wrong. I absolutely loved the literature girl segments, and I also thought the High School Girls are Funky segments were always great. I however found most of the jokes to fall flat. Specifically Hidenori's segments, which take up most of the show. All the other characters are far more interesting and have much funnier moments.

With this week being my week off, I've had a lot of time to watch what I got on X-mas.

[Nodame Cantabile:](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1698/Nodame_Cantabile) After watching Your Lie in April and since it is on hiatus, I saw on mal that this was similar and I am loving it. The music and character interactions are great. 

[Spice and Wolf Season 1 + 2:](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou) I've heard tons of people talk about how great S&W is, and now I will be one of those people, it is one of my favorite animes at the moment. The setting, music, characters, and interactions are all great. 

[Welcome to the NHK:](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/NHK_ni_Youkoso!) Bought this one on a whim since it was $9 on sale after one of my friends told me it was good. I enjoyed everything about it, best $9 I have spent.

**Cold Open**

Since I'm going back to school soon, I decided to marathon **The Tatami Galaxy** because it's apparently impactful for those in college.

Throughout my marathon, I was so into the show that I started to commentate a lot and thus recorded down my reactions on a Word Doc for certain shots and scenes of the series.  After finishing the show, it reached about 14 pages worth of reactions.  It's going to take a lot of effort to get it into working order if somebody wants to see it, I don't think the pay-off at the end will feel worth it if it gets overlooked or not read.  If you're a little bit interested then let me know, otherwise it'll forever be gone on my hard drive.  Note that it's done in a time-stamp type fashion.

An aside, I wished I had a fast computer so I can appreciate the glorious 1080p without lag between going into the OP and ED.  

Anyways, enough rambling on, here's what I thought about the show!

**Cue the [Opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyYCYd2wHY4)!**

**Tatami Galaxy (11/11)**

A show that goes so fast that you'll have to be prepared to press the space bar so that you can appreciate whats being said on-screen.  Well, that is if youre a slow reader or dont like paying attentively to the screen for an episodes length.  In my opinion, being able to stop the screen so that I can read whats happening helped me process and retain the dialogue and visual information better.

Its the most visually expressive show Ive seen in terms of highlighting situations and characters just through its art styles and/or exaggeration.  Thus, making me think it hit its marks consistently throughout the entire show.  Now, the execution in terms of presenting the story through visuals is quite unconventional by mixing in multiple different art styles and live-action.  While I can see it could be quite jarring to some, to me it felt like it fit so well and made the environments feel a bit more alive as well as gave a sense of feeling that its taking place in reality.

It has an episodic nature to it however I feel like youll miss some nice subtle details, references, and call-backs from previous episodes if you dont do little bursts of 2-3 episodes.  I say this because I was able to piece together the what, why, and how of certain events happening in certain episodes due to new information being revealed in newer episodes.  Finding out these little details really made me appreciate the show and its character a lot as I went along when watching it because I was able to answer my own questions.

**Thoughts with Spoilers for the show**

I felt quite proud of myself of being able to predict the messages and themes that Watashi needed in order to [minor spoilers](/s "continue progressing his character near the end.") I think I was able to do this because I've been through a similar situation before and thus was able to relate to his character deeply.  However, what caught me off guard at the end was [Series Spoilers](/s "Watashi seeing the colour of every parallel world he was in.  Ive never taken into account about treasuring the personalities, events, and habits those unique parallel worlds provided because I was so stuck in Watashis first-person state in mind.  As a result, Watashi in a way already found his rose-coloured campus life.  Thing was that he never realized he had it the whole time until he started to take a step-back from all the action.")

So, what did I take out from this series?  

A theme I got it from was [Thematic spoilers](/s "to try and take a step back from what youre currently experiencing and objectively look at it.  Sometimes the emotional experience isnt entirely accurate of what the real experience is.")

Throughout the series, the MC's view point was [Series spoilers](/s "always in first-person but once he reached the tenth and final episode is when he was able to look at his past lives in third-person.  When the audience got that third-person objective view is when we were able to notice the little gems and lessons that the series was trying to tell to us all along.  Like how Ozu was a true friend for Watashi, how the people around him made life more special for him, and how there was colour in every parallel world.")

I also really like the optimistic themes people got out of the series like [thematic spoilers](/s "continuing to live your life even though it feels wasted, and to keep moving on even if there were missteps.")  I  personally wanted to opt to those since they're quite optimistic but I wanted to have my own interpretation of the message the show was trying to tell.

**Final thoughts about the show**

- Akashi is best girl.  You can't deny it because she's literally [spoilers](/s "fucking everywhere") in the show whether it be [spoilers](/s "that white Muchigumon or her own presence.")  It kind of annoyed me that [minor spoilers](/s "Watashi was so dense to notice what the 'opportunity' was after being said so many times,") however I could forgive the guy since he was after all still learning.

- Ozu is the greatest motherfucker around.

- With the amount of time that the show had, it didn't feel rushed and it felt really tight in delivering its themes.

- The little details and call-backs excited me dearly as they were brought up.

- This is one of my favourite shows by Masaaki Yuasa.

- Final verdict: This show is objectively better than school. 11/10.

**[The End is near.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IcFDwygw-o)**

**Personal Impact**

The series also reminded me of an idea/lifestyle I forgot long ago or completely dismissed entirely.  That thing is to cherish every little moment because its those little moments that make certain events have a little spark and uniqueness to them.  

I initially dismissed it because I think I wanted my life to be grandiose, to achieve the very best, and this was sparked by my feelings of the pressure and demands from my family lately.  Of course, that wasnt the best type of thinking because I think I lost a bit of a piece of myself.  I saw everything as grey because I looked at everything in broad strokes, I didnt bother to see anything significant in the little things because it was minimal and trivial in my mind.  At the time, I thought those little things didnt matter to the bigger picture, so why bother wasting energy on it?  

This show reminded me that they did matter because its those little things that provided the unique points of difference for every event I encounter in my daily life.  I wanted my life to be special like in the media I've been exposed to, however that's not possible and the best option is to accept that my life was already special as is.  Any life in a way is already special, everybody has a story to tell and I feel like an idiot for completely dismissing this philosophy/viewpoint I held in regard long ago.

Like how Watashi was able to learn that his entire campus life already had [spoilers](/s "colour in them.")  I also learned that my life was like that as well.

---

If you made it this far, thanks for reading my long spiel about what I thought about the show!

>> ARTICLE
Glad to hear you had such a great experience with Tatami Galaxy! I will never pass up an opportunity to shower praise on Ozu. He is the best.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!  And yeah, Ozu is definitely the best.  At first I didn't like him because Watashi kept on failing so many times due to his involvement but after a while I grew to like the dude.

Gintama. Started last month, am past 130 episodes and can't stop ^(*somebody stop me*). It's funny, it's sad, it's poignant, it's absurd, it's hilarious, it's a great roller coaster of emotions, but mostly positive or optimistic, which leaves me feeling good each time. I thought it was a mostly nonsensical-comical episodic series, so I appreciate its "continuity"/internal consistency (as in, while it doesn't have a clear long-term goal, it's not a perfectly insulated status quo world where the reset button is pressed at each episode) and the evolution in the interactions between the ever-growing colorful cast. And as a great fan of absurd comedy, I love the ways they just annihilate the fourth wall.

...So yeah, I like it a lot. I'll go watch another episode now. ^(*somebody stop me*).

**[Sekai Seifuku: Bouryaku no Zvezda](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20973/Sekai_Seifuku:_Bouryaku_no_Zvezda)** - It was a really silly and fun show, I enjoyed it a lot. Now it'd be about time for Kate to come to Hungary and conquer it.

**[Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26349/Danna_ga_Nani_wo_Itteiru_ka_Wakaranai_Ken)** - I usually don't watch shorts for the sole reason of if it's good it's just simpy not enough. And that's exactly the case with this one as well. The humor was great, and there were some really hearthwarming moments, and I'm really happy that this gets a season 2.
>> ARTICLE
I finished **Serial Experiments Lain** and I don't really know what the hell was going on, but it was interesting. I was glued to the screen trying to decipher everything, and it really did have a very captivating and eerie atmosphere. Its ambition, uniqueness, and depth are all worthy of applause. Overall I'd say that I enjoyed my time with it and it definitely left me thinking.

**Toyko Ghoul** was uh... Kind of shit. Ridiculous pacing, laughable antagonists, torture porn, too much censoring, and most characters were average at best. The premise was definitely interesting, but I can agree with most that it's been far better explored and executed in Parasyte. The last episode was really enjoyable though. My jaw was dropped for most of it. 

**Kokoro Connect: Michi Random** was frustrating to say the least. I thought the series had some decent themes and though I thought it was melodramatic, I was okay with a lot of it. In the ova however, I could not get into it or buy into the drama and the character struggles that were going on. Some of the story was just dumb, like how does [](#s "Inaba get captured and put at knife point") even make sense in context? Iori's motivations and actions were stupid, you think should would have learned from past experiences. [](#s "I was a supporter or Iori in the series, but Inaba became best girl and won"). I think the series as a whole is overrated, with this ova being even worse.

I'm also trying to catch up on **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders**. It's more JoJo, but I don't think it's as enjoyable or impactful as the first season. It's okay, I still really enjoy watching it.

**Tsukimonogatari** - Finished - 8/10

*Shaft* did it again. And one of my favorite *arcs* overall.

**Log Horizon** - Finished - 8/10

Now this a take on MMO topic I like! Not that I dislike SAO, but this is whole lot more believable and complex. Only thing that was really annoying were the children and their arc. It felt really unnecessary.

**Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo** - Finished - 8/10

I didn't know Rewatch is happening so I marathoned it. Really the only thing I can say against this is inconsistency in Sorata's behavior. It's like his personality changes every 3-4 episodes. Once he's a good guy, and next episode he's a jerk again, and this repeats about 3 times. But the ending was really nice and kinda saved it.

**Akame ga Kill!** - Finished - 7/10

Decapitating experience. But really, it was fun to watch. Kinda disturbing at time (I'm looking at you ep1) but the action was entertaining and all the characters were very likable. But the ending was damn stupid. 

**Carnival Phantasm** - Currently watching

What the fuck did I just watch?! I love it!

**Mirai Nikki** - Dropped

I really disliked the voices. I tried both sub and dub but I really disliked both. Damn, I really wanted to see the *queen of yandere*.

* [**Aldnoah.Zero**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=22729) - **Completed Re-Watch** - Did a marathon re-watch except this time with a friend I've slowly been brainwashing into anime over time. He really loved the series and he's now excited to follow the second season with me when it starts airing. During the re-watch, I also got to learn new things I didn't notice before in terms of development and things of the like. I've promoted this series to be marked as Tier 3 on my MAL as anything I've re-watched more than once automatically becomes Tier 3. :3 During this re-watch, I've really come to love the development and subtle things that indicate character development. One of the things I didn't notice before was that [Spoilers](/s "when Rayet is in the Jail Cell and Yuki (Inaho's Sister) visits her, she opens her jacket which I think was a good show that she's finally opening herself up. After all, she's never unzipped her jacket before that point.") Also listening to the soundtrack and focusing on it more as it played in the series really just goes to show how well done it was. They really did great to build the mood and the atmosphere. I'm still loving it as I'm still playing it. :3 Overall, it's just been a fun re-watch and we did it over the course of a single day which is amazing for my friend.
* [**Code Geass**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=1575) - **Re-Watching** - My first anime of the new year is a re-watch of one of my all time favorite series. As I've run out of more recent series to show my friend, we've gone with a classic favorite of mine and he's really enjoying it so far. It's going to be his longest series yet and I'm still loving every episode of it so far. :3 This makes my 9th time watching this series and I'm sure we'll get through it over the course of the month whenever he is over.

I hope everyone's had great new years eve! I spent mine with besties I haven't seen in a while, playing Dota 2 for the first in years; was glad to see my Kunkka skills weren't too rusty (nothing feels better than landing a good torrent-ship.)

I watched the movie *AURA: Koga Maryuin's Last War.* It's a story about chuunibyou, and of a slightly similar vein as *Chuu2Koi*, albeit with far less comedy and far more drama. It's based on a novel by Romeo Tanaka (the same man who wrote *Humanity Has Declined*). 

Part of what makes this interesting is who the director is, Seiji Kishi. Of his shows, I've seen *Persona 4*, *Angel Beats!*, *Humanity Has Declined* and *Carnival Phantasm*. In all of these shows, I thought his greatest weakness was his drama - AB's was rushed and mandated more character investment than was present to be effective, and P4A's plot was kind of rushed and lackluster. And coincidentally, his greatest strength has been his humor - all four of his shows I've seen were hilarious (with the possible exception of Jinrui, which was merely funny.) So it's strange that I found the drama in *AURA* so put together. We had good camera angles, decent usage of silence and music to build atmosphere and tension, and the plot wasn't overblown. 

I'm not sure what happened here, but Kishi seems to have learned from his mistakes, **OR** Romeo Tanaka's source material constrained him/boosted him so that he wouldn't fall into his bad habits. Either way, *AURA* was pretty great - I felt like the movie was treating me intelligently, and I think my biggest issue was that our main couple's romance wasn't very believable (I guess he never learned from his romantic mistakes in *Angel Beats*, did he?) For a 1.5 hour movie, it's surprisingly dense, but didn't feel rushed. Overall, I gave it an 8/10. It's definitely one of the better anime movies to come out in the past few years, even if I don't think it's the best.

A bunch of stuff actually due to me having a large amount of time off.

* [**Amagami SS**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8676/Amagami_SS) **(16/25)** : A pretty entertaining high school rom com. Most importantly, stuff actually happens!

* [**Space Dandy s1**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20057/Space%E2%98%86Dandy) **(Rewatch 9/13)**. Not much to say, this is just a really fun show.

I finished Shinsekai Yori yesterday because this sub kept talking about how it's world was really fascinating, and how Squealer wasn't a bad guy.


Holy moly did it live up to my expectations and more. It was great, the entire world was so interesting, the characters were great, and the fate of [Shinsekai Yori](/s "Maria and Mamoru still sort of eats away at me, because we can only assume they died horrible deaths after having their child stolen...")

God it was such a great show, I wish I had more
>> ARTICLE
[Shinsekai](/s 'I kind of assumed that Maria and Mamoru were lobotomized soon after they ran away and Maria gave birth through artificially inseminated.  This is the same thing squealer's tribe did to their Queen.  They were dead before having their child stolen.  Maria's sacrifice had the biggest impact on me as well.  By all accounts Saki was the love of her life but Mamoru needed her most and had no one else.  She knew that Saki was strong enough to take care of herself but that only she could take care of Mamoru.  We never really find out what happened to them other than those bones Squealer fabricated turned out to be real :S ')
>> ARTICLE
Squealer did nothing wrong! I just finished the show too and I have to agree it was great. I like to imagine that [Shinsekai Yori](/s "Mamoru and Maria had quick, painless deaths, it doesn't make sense for Squealer to kill them slowly")
>> ARTICLE
He did nothing wrong but I am pro-human and have only minor moral qualms subjugating lesser species to the benefit of my own. So fuck Squealer and his rat race.However, I would prefer to develop a non-sentient or mechanical solution to resolve that minor moral pang I would have.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished yesterday as well, man was that one of the most satisfying endings ever? For once I felt satisfied with an ending!
>> ARTICLE
I finished **Sabagebu!** and **Witch Craft Works** this week. I was mildly surprised by both. 

Sabagebu! was a somewhat refreshing comedy where the main girl is kind of a bitch to the other girls. Not to mention she would pretty much betray anyone at the drop of a hat. It was also nice to see that every character was flawed, thus allowing for better chemistry. There were some moments that made me question what I just saw/heard and others that universally funny.

Witch Craft Works was something I picked up on a comment a friend made a while back. He said it was surprisingly good, and he was correct on that. The role-reversal was nice and the mechanics for magic was simple; and not breaking its own rules. There were plenty of strong female characters, but not so many deep ones; but I would chalk this up to the law of averages, as nearly all characters were female. The motivations for villains didn't seem to come out so clearly. It was clear of what they wanted, but I couldn't seem to understand why, much like the main character. Perhaps the flaw of the adaptation is that it is an adaptation. The source material is there and I can access it if I like. It just always frustrates me when series are mostly promos for the manga/LN/VN/card game/etc. Regardless of the flaw, it still stands as a decent series with good mechanics, memorable characters, and an interesting story that might make you go want to continue with it.

I said I was mildly surprised because I knew these two series were getting praise when they were airing and afterwards. If I had no idea beforehand, I would be very pleased with my choices.

**Rewatched** [**Hourou Musuko**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko) **(1-12)**

There was a time in my life when I thought Hourou Musuko was a boring show where nothing happened.

That was before I knew about subtext. 

Hourou Musuko is a lot of things. Its an empathetic portrayal of transsexuality and the whims of society. Its an understated endeavour of gender identity framed from the perspective of a coming-of-age story. Its an honest exploration of interpersonal relationships with a tinge of adolescent social anxiety. 

Its a slow, grounded experience that wants you to see it for what it is. You might be a nice person who just finds transsexuality disturbing because it feels unnatural. So it reaches out and holds your hand - not to lead you, but to walk with you, slowly and steadily, to try and help you appreciate the path. 

Because it knows. It knows that women still dont have the agency for their crossdressing to be taken as more than a fashion statement. It knows that their male counterparts are reduced to freak shows because theyre not as easy to fetishize. It knows that people wont see your genderbending play as anything more than entertaining theatrics. 

But it knows we can move past this  we can *overcome*. Its a long road paved with frustration, anxiety and doubt. Yet it keeps its head high. Maybe with a different audience, your genderbending play might speak to *someone*, somewhere. Because if just one person stops laughing the next time they see you, everything would have been worth it.

Hourou Musuko is probably one of the best shows I will ever watch.

**[Legend of the Galactic Heroes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu) (33-92/110)**  
Damn I watched a lot this week. It's so good though, I can't wait to finish it up in the next several days.

**[Cromartie High School](http://myanimelist.net/anime/114/Sakigake!!_Cromartie_Koukou) (1-6/26)**  
Pretty funny one my brother showed me, will finish this up at some point!
>> ARTICLE
Legend of the Galactic Heroes is coming up on my to watch list, and I am very excited!

Glad to see it is very marathonable. That is one of my favorite ways to do it when I have time.
>> ARTICLE
Sweet, it's definitely worth a watch from having seen 90% of it. Near the beginning I was worried I'd get burnt out but that hasn't been the case! I'm currently watching episode 101 and am hoping to finish by the end of the day
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I might have to push it to my "next to watch" selection
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I finished it, 10/10. If you've got time to marathon coming up I'd say it would be great to pick it up, but either way definitely get around to it eventually, such an impressive show.
>> ARTICLE
At the rate I am going, I will most likely be starting it in a few days. Probably won't get too many chances to marathon it, but I'll squeeze in as many as I can.

Very excited about this since I've been interested for a while, but am now super motivated to finally dive in.

Thank you

I've just finished watching the second season of **The World God Only Knows**. It was really good

You're in for a treat with the third

**Seitokai no Ichizon (9/12 Episodes)** I was expecting a good MC, got a fucking amazing MC. Pretty funny, bombs you with references, too many to count sometimes, not that that's a bad thing.

Planing to watch S2 after I finished S1.

>> ARTICLE
Let's see ... I watched:

**Another**.  This was better than expected.  I wasn't really scared, but the story was interesting.  That said, they had to try really hard for people to not talk to each other and communicate in order to actually make the anime work.  Slightly awkward.  Maybe 7/10.  I'd drop it to 6 for how artificial they had to be to make the plot work, but at the end of the day the plot was interesting for it, so ok.

**11eyes**.  11eyes is kinda bad.  Lot of random concepts and themes in the show.  Execution was "meh" all around with too much deus ex to be believable.  At the end of the day the character designs were vaguely interesting so, 5/10.

**Mikakunin de Shinkoukei**.  In a word, boring.  Basically a slice of life with one minor twist that isn't hugely interesting.  The female lead is so boring that 70% of the anime focuses on her sister and the kid.  In theory, a female character that is 100% normal isn't a bad idea.  If they ran with that and focused on her more with more plot, the anime could have been something.  As-is, it feels like 8 episodes of shallow comedy filler centered on other characters with maybe 3-4 episodes of actual content with the main characters.  Still manages to be vaguely likeable.  6/10.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!**  This show was surprisingly good.  I enjoyed it a lot, 8/10.

**C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control**.  This was pretty interesting.  The money theory was so-so.  The plot was fairly interesting.  I feel like the Japanese government had a hand in sponsoring the plot though, or something.  7/10.
>> ARTICLE
I never see anyone talk about C. It was one of the first anime I ever watched and I just really enjoyed the relationship between the MC and his asset. Glad to see someone else enjoyed it(?)
>> ARTICLE
I started Legend of the Galactic Heroes(episode 4) and Mawaru Penguindrum (e20)

LoGH has many many good political statements. I will definitively enjoy it and Mawaru Penguindrum is really catchy, fast paced colourful and detailed  all while being somehow disturbing. 
>> ARTICLE
Birdy the mighty: Decode. I remembered how much I loved it. It needs another season!
>> ARTICLE
This past week has been a nice blend of two shows with unique worlds.

 **Haibane Renmei** 
I've been talking to a filmmaker friend of mine and have been wondering...if shows could be on premium cable via anime adaptation, which would be considered the cream of the crop to adapt? 

That's a fairly easy answer for me, as it's any of the Yoshitoshi ABe trio (Lain, Texhnolyze, and Renmei). However, Haibane Renmei's world, characters and pace is pleasantly discomforting. These characters are stuck somewhere, relegated to this world and its rules because of what they've become. I'm pretty sure that's what ABe sets these characters up for when he designs them; discomfort in their own worlds. Considering I'm on Episode 4, I'm aware that shit is going to go down...and I'm loving every minute of it. The OST is brilliant as well.

**Durarara!!**
It took me a year or so to finally get sucked into this world, as it took me five tries to get past the first episode (which is slow in comparison to where it's gone since I've watched) -- but once I got past that initial episode setting up ideas of characters versus the actual character backstories, I was hooked. The world of Ikebukuro is vast, vivid and lively with all these characters contributing to every ounce of energy that's being brought to every frame of every episode (so far). I'm on Episode 5 now and I'm pretty invested in it; whether it be the side characters, the motivations, the weirdness and most importantly, my bro Simon. Don't mess with that dude. 

Happy 2015, kiddos.
>> ARTICLE
I got hooked up with **Chihayafuru** and finished both seasons in about 3 days. It even brought me to some tears which isn't very common for me. I also wasn't very impressed after to first couple episodes but after a while karuta and the characters became really fascinating. 
>> ARTICLE
**Naruto Shippuden (21-74/???)** 

The fight between Sakura and Sasori was kind of boring to be honest. But that old lady though! So far Im just going with it. Im pretty curious to see the other members of the Akatsuki. Im jus waiting till I get caught up with the anime, because Im pretty sure its gets even more awesome later on. I already kind of spoiled myself a little, but that gave me even more motivation to keep watching the show. The scene I saw looked pretty epic though. 
>> ARTICLE
**[Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate) (25/25 (including OVA))**

Really enjoyed this show. The character interactions were probably the highlight of it for me and the fact that I was able to follow along with the complexity of time travel relatively easily. It was also pretty fun thinking of how the main issue could be solved before it actually was.

**[Say "I Love You"](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14289/Sukitte_Ii_na_yo.) (14/14 (including OVA))**

I actually was supposed to have finished this show two weeks ago, but for whatever reason I stopped it 2 minutes in. Either way, I decided to pick it back up one night and really enjoyed it. Rather than have two characters create a connection and finally get into a relationship, they end up in a relationship early on and from there on it's a story about how these two polar opposites (socially at least) find out that maybe they have a lot more in common. I liked the comedic moments and the serious, heartfelt moments in the show as well.

**[Nekomonogatari: Kuro](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15689/Nekomonogatari:_Kuro) (4/4)**

Something I remember Hachikuji saying in Bakemonogatari was that she thought Araragi would've ended up with Tsubasa instead of Senjougahara, and I think Neko: Kuro went into detail as to why. It was a pretty interesting look on how you could know if you really love someone and (I believe) what it means to love someone. Hopefully by next week I'll finish Monogatari SS, Hana, and Tsuki. I'm definitely looking forward to it.

**[Pupa](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19315/Pupa) (12/12)**

First of two shorts I watched this week. I was able to catch this the day before Crunchyroll took it off their site and, like I'm sure many others were very confused by it. I think the premise was there and had it not been a short (or at least a better organized short) it would've been more enjoyable. The story was all over the place and the censoring was inconsistent. A plus though is that I enjoyed the OP and the ED even more. For whatever reason, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pTcxQLBav8) ED video made me feel strange. I have no idea what it is to this day, but the song and imagery just made me think of a tortured soul and made me feel very weird.

**[I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26349/Danna_ga_Nani_wo_Itteiru_ka_Wakaranai_Ken) (13/13)**

Second short of the week. I saw a post here about a week ago saying something about a second season for this show, so a few days later I decided to watch it because altogether it's less than an hour. Why not, right? Boy oh boy was I glad I saw this. I laughed a lot, I found Hajime and Kaoru's relationship cute, and I love how they played off each other a lot. Only thing that sucks is that I have to wait until April for season 2, and I'm impatient. Now if you'll excuse me, [I need to find a horse mask to buy.](https://gfycat.com/SpiritedMaleAltiplanochinchillamouse)

**Kara no Kyoukai** - Just finished movie #7 a couple days ago and my god what an incredible series. Everything looked and sounded gorgeous, and Shiki might be one of my favorite characters ever.  The plot was sort of confusing at first but I really liked how it was ordered, and the overall story was very good. It kept you drawn in and I was honestly never bored, even with movie #6. The fifth and seventh movies were amazing, but I loved pretty much every movie.

I've yet to and I'm not sure if I should watch the epilogue and whatever was released after. I felt it ended really well and people seem to have been disappointed by them.
>> ARTICLE
The epilogue is a really long conversation between Koukuto and Shiki's [](#s "third personality") which expands on her a bit more. It's boring to many people who aren't hardcore fans.
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of on a KyoAni (Amaburi included) roll, so I started watching **Hyouka** yesterday. It started off beautifully with that hair scene and totally left me wanting  more.

I'm also casually watching **K-On!!** whenever I want to relax. It's a goddamn giant ball of happiness and I usually watch 2 or 3 episodes per week, because I don't want it to end. Voice cast is doing phenomenal job as always. As an aspiring voice actor, it leaves me speechless how natural their performances are. ^^Also ^^Mio ^^best ^^girl.
>> ARTICLE
I finally picked up **Bakemonogatari** after years of putting it on my backlog and my god this anime is freaking fantastic so far.
>> ARTICLE
Marathoned Sakurasou and boy it was fun. Really well done, liked all of the characters which doesn't usually happen. Last three episodes left me in tears which happened to me before I think only once when I was like 6 at the end of E.T.. I Also really enjoyed the ending of that series. People I wanted together ended up together and pretty much everything got resolved.

Then I picked up TTGL again after dropping it. I started watching it after finishing Kill la Kill since people suggested it which was one of the problems I guess, since I looked for more Kill la Kill and didn't really feel it from TTGL. Then someone spoiled episode 8 to me which I found quite intriguing so I decided to pick the show up again and I am glad I did. [Major Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann spoilers.](/s "My biggest issue with the show was actually Kamina. All of the episodes up until that point were pretty much, Kamina yells at someone then yells at Simon to get Lagann and combine and then he fucked shit up without thinking, nothing else. Then he did the same thing in ep. 8 and  got BTFOd. After that happened other characters finally got some spotlight and I feel that story in general got better.") Currently I am at the first after time skip episode and really like it so far.
>> ARTICLE
Finally freaking finished watching **Cowboy Bebop**. And holy crap, that ending. Not much to say other than this: when's it's a normal episode, it's pretty good. When it's an episode focused on backstory and/or on the main plot thread, it's truly incredible.

See you Space Cowboy, indeed.

Got halfway through **Katanagatari** as well. You know that feeling when you just *connect* with characters? Yeah, that happened with Togame and Shichika. 
(I'm probably going to watch episode 7 later today, and I'm so ready for [major spoilers](#s "Nanami being revealed as a sword carrier and then being killed by her brother"). It's still hilarious to me that the spoiler was outright stated at the end of episode 6.
>> ARTICLE
I finally got around to watching [**Hanasaku Iroha** ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9289/Hanasaku_Iroha) this week, and it was wonderful. I absolutely adored this anime. Everything in this show blended very well together to create a relaxing atmosphere that was very fun to watch. I found myself craving more and more each episode. Definitely check it out if you're a fan of SoL, it's one of the greatest and more underwatched Slice of Life anime I have seen.

Also, [here is some Minko,](http://i.imgur.com/sLuuXUQ.jpg) [maybe she'll convince you to watch the anime.](http://i.imgur.com/9cd7R5M.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I watched **Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun**. All of it.

My summary of it can described as: **OH MY GOD SHE'S SO ADORABLE! OH MY GOD I'M GRINNING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRETY OF EACH EPISODE! OH MY GOD SHE'S SO ADORABLE!** *But Seo is best girl.*
>> ARTICLE
**Fate/Zero**, I can't believe I have missed out on such a great show. I tried it once but dropped it after two episodes because I didn't like the idea of having multiple main characters, and not a single character that the story revolves around. I watched the Fate/Stay Night that just finished its first cour and that triggered me to retry F/Z. AND GOD DAMN THERE WAS SO MUCH I WAS MISSING IN F/N B/C I DIDN'T WATCH F/Z PREVIOUSLY. I give F/Z a solid 9/10.
>> ARTICLE
Finally started Steins;gate, five episodes in at the moment. Daru is a hero and Mayuri is too fucking adorable. Seen lots of people say they had trouble getting through the first.. twelve, was it? But the dialogue in this show is by far my favorite thing about it so far.
>> ARTICLE
Started **Kara no Kyoukai** yesterday, watched the first 2 movies so far. I hardly understand anything that happens but I expected nothing else from an achronological movie series based on a Type Moon light novel. I enjoy it so far for the high production quality and the **unbelievably amazing** OST, even though I'd much prefer if it was a normal TV series instead of a movie series.

Also started **Amagi Brilliant Park** yesterday (I hope mentioning it is okay, since it's already finished), and I'm surrently on episode 5. Really enjoying the comedy and character interactions. It's a super fun show overall and I hope they keep the same quality of writing and animation for the remainder of the series.

And finally, I continued my **Durarara!!** rewatch in preparation (and celebration) of the new season. It's one of my all time favorites and I enjoy every second of it. It's been a few years since I watched it last so I'm constantly being reminded just why I love this show so much. I think I actually enjoy it more than before, since I'm older now, and able to watch it with more of an analytical point of view. I never realized just how amazing Celty, as a character, is. It's a fantastic show and I just can't wait for the second season to come!
>> ARTICLE
**Aldnoah.Zero** was pretty damn cool. Lots of good fights, and I'm hype for the second bit. There were parts of it that got a little confusing (sometimes I had trouble telling where exactly some of the characters were supposed to be at any given moment), but other than that it was a solidly written show that made me actually care about most of the characters. Also, *Slaine did nothing wrong!*

I know it comes highly recommended, but I really thought **Clannad** was dull as dishwater. It had some nice, feelsy moments, and there were times when it was pretty damn funny too, but there was just a little too much nothing going on for me to maintain a vested interest in it. I found myself tabbing over to Reddit way more often than I do when I'm watching other things. I sort of found myself wishing they would just focus on Nagisa and let that relationship develop. I know it's based on a VN, and you've got to appeal to the people that played every route. Hell, if they adapted some of the VNs I like and ignored the girl I thought was best, I'd probably be sore too, but it's not as good from a story perspective because it makes the show feel a little schizophrenic. People say that the only reason to watch Clannad is so you can get to After Story anyway, so as soon as I'm done detoxing from the first one, I'll probably start that so I can see what all the fuss is about.

Watched about four episodes of **Yosuga No Sora** and dropped it because I got bored waiting for the incest. I might pick it back up at some point later on.

Currently watching **Nisekoi**. About a fourth of the way in, and it's pretty entertaining if you just shut your brain off and watch the cute girls be cute. It's not anything I'd recommend to anyone that wasn't hurting for stuff to watch though. I'll probably finish it because I can't really say I'm not enjoying myself, but it's pretty insubstantial. Although the animation is good as gold.
>> ARTICLE
Marathoned **Nisekoi** over two days. Really enjoyable(Chitoge best girl), but the comedy was made up entirely of the character's overreactions to whatever situation, so marathoning it made that get old quickly. [Spoiler](/s "Was really hoping for some kind of relationship development, but with people saying the manga barely has any after 150+ chapters, i'm kinda disappointed.")  
Still looking forward to S2 next season.
>> ARTICLE
**Bartender (11/11) -** I thought the show was fairly nice, a feel good type of anime. The art style is pretty average, something I would expect from a show in 2006. Reminded me a lot of Mushishi.

**House of Five Leaves (1-8/12) -** Yeah, this show is really enjoyable. The character designs are unique, and the art really feels like something out of a myth. The character personalities are intriguing also.
>> ARTICLE
Had a lot of time off due to Christmas break, so I had time to watch a few shows:


**Break Blade**

I watched the films, and really enjoyed them. The story was not one of its strong points, so I won't mention it, but I really like how they handled the mechas. They were heavy, worn down and moved slowly, but they still managed to create excellent fighting scenes. That was definitely the series' strong point IMO.


**Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam**

I actually started this ages ago, but watched it a couple of episodes every now and then. It was a bit of a drag sometimes, but the classic [MSGZ](/s "kill 'em all") ending made up for a lot of it, especially when [MSGZ](/s "Paptimus destroyed Kamille's mind") at the end. Not bad, but MSG 00 still reigns supreme as my all-time favourite Gundam series.


**Psycho-Pass 2**

As a fan of the original Psycho-Pass, I quite enjoyed this one as well. It was still a bit of the tried-and-true formula, as [Psycho-Pass S1](/s "they had already revealed Sybil's true nature"). Not as climactic or outright good as S1, but still very enjoyable nonetheless if you liked S1.


**Kokoro Connect**

Rewatched season 1, and watched season 2 for the first time. Pretty good, and S2's ending was more satisfying than S1. Shame they pulled some shit at the studio, I'd like to see more of this.

I've been working to clear my On-Hold list, nuking all the titles that have finished airing and getting them all out of the way. And, for the most part, it was a poor decision. Just a few brief thoughts while watching the playoffs.

**Samurai Flamenco**

Honestly, it could have been a much better anime if it could have just decided what it wanted to be. Did it want to be a Super Sentai anime? A Giant Robot anime? An adventure anime? An idol anime? It just mixed everything up in a gigantic grab bag of genres and styles so much that it just became a huge nonsensical muddle of nothing before it ended. It had many good points, not the least of which were some interesting characters and great acting. Unfortunately, they were offset by its failings.

And no. It's not that I don't like any anime that doesn't take itself seriously. I *love* anime that refuses to take itself seriously. You can't be a fan of Nabeshin without loving anime that refuses to take itself seriously. I just prefer that the anime have at least an internal consistency throughout, and SamFlam just never did anything for me. From Episode 2 onward, it left me without a single moment of awe and enjoyment.

Score: 5/10  
Recommendation Level: Someone not me.  

**Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru**

Ummm... No. Just no. Nothing worked for me. The characters were dumb. The voices were all wrong. The scripts were imbecilic. The art was phoned in. I didn't even like the OP, and that's usually one of the first signs that I'll hate a title. 

There was a reason why I stopped watching this show. Unfortunately, it was so long ago that I had forgotten that reason. And simply, the reason was that it sucked.

Score: 3/10  
Recommendation Level: Might be more fun to people who like getting stoned and watching anime.  

**Little Busters**  
Progress: 10/26  

I first put it on hold because I was kinda bored with it. I had just gotten done watching simple SOL after simple SOL, and I needed something a bit different for a while. So now I'm ready to come back to Little Busters, and... And now I'm wondering why it took me so long.

Ask me next week for the rest of my impressions. For now, though, I'm just ready for some football.

###[Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) (185-192/201)

Discussion thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2r7g2t/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_185192/).

###[Durarara!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6746) (1-24/24) + [Specials](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8408) (1-2/2)

> Whats that got to do with kicking your ass?

**Warning**: Storytelling mechanics and symbolism spoilers

Watched in preparation for the Winter 2015 season and as an excuse to tackle a more high-profile show.
Having enjoyed [Into the Forest of Fireflies Light](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10408), I was excited to learn that the two productions shared a similar staff. I can say for certain that Ill be combing through Omori Takahiros catalog in the near future and keeping an eye out for his future works.

To me, Durarara is a series of real and apparent demonstrations of power and influence of the individual and of the collective, drawing its characters to forge their place and purpose within the sprawling urban district of Ikeburuko. What really makes the show stand out is its variety in representing its factions. The Color Gangs flagrantly tout their affiliations and act more or less freely and in a pseudo-thuggish fashion while the Dollars are given a much more abstract presence.  Nonetheless, each is given equal weight in ability and dangled overhead is the inevitability of a turf war which is only further exacerbated by the entry of a third party in the second act. The show goes so far as to ask outright, Who is the strongest in this city? while we overhear whispered speculation from the populace. However, it can be said that the talk of strength is a means to an end. Each character is seeking something that can only be obtained maintaining an imposing air about themselves. The highest emotional point for myself as a viewer was [Ep 11](/s "Mikado exercising his clout as leader of the Dollars to confront Yagiri Pharma in order to escape the everyday while Celty put herself on display, carving her existence into the back of the crowds heads and accepting herself in her current form, after Mika assumed Celtys identity in order to gain Seijis affection.")

Its stories are told in a nonlinear manner, often rotating the role of narrator to craft prose that compliments the narrative of the particular episode. Oftentimes were presented with the end of the tale up front and are led back to the conclusion after gaining a few new perspectives of the sequence of events. It gives you the feeling that a lot is going on concurrently, that the history of a city is complex and not confinable to a single discernible thread.

Because of its choice in presentation, no character wore out his welcome. In fact, it was the strength of its cast that let it build grace and tension in its first half. I got giddy anytime Shizuo scrolled across the screen. Simons soft and morally sound interior, coupled with his intimidating appearance, was made endearing as he peddled Russian Sushi. Celtys nuances as a woman, let alone as a [](/s "Dullahan / supernatural entity / urban legend"), exudes enough intrigue to warrant a spinoff dedicated to her and Shinra. Its cast is simply awesome by description alone.

**Quicklist of things I liked**:

* How the recap of the previous episodes are contained in a segment of the opening song.
* Mamoru Miyanos colorful performance as Kida, though the entire voice cast was superb.
* Coloring the riffraff of the crowds as gray. It divorced bystanders from the events on screen, highlighting the point-to-point happenings and conveying the ease of loneliness in the city. 
* The attitude of some insert tracks. There are some dirty, jazzy pieces that are unlike what I hear in most other shows in the medium.
* References to other IPs were fun to spot. I believe in the first episode Walker and Erika were moving a large Holo display.

Really the only thing I disliked was [](/s "the difficulty I had in accepting Kida as a leader and how the second arc didnt weave things together in a way that felt as compelling as the first").

###Afterword

Finished **Kyoukai no Kanata** really glad that I finally got around to watching it and looking forward to the movie!

The only real problem I have with the series is [ending spoilers](/s "When Kuriyama comes back at the end and there really is no explanation for why"). Otherwise a great anime.
>> ARTICLE
Its great :)
>> ARTICLE
Watched all of the first Shugo Chara series...Suprisingly lewd subtext for a kids show, also finished Captain Earth (bloody horrible), the last 3 Towa no Quon movies and the last Mardock Scramble movie..they were interesting. Most importantly however, I had a NGE rewatch marathon for new years, that was fun.
>> ARTICLE
**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun 9-12**

I just didn't think the show was that funny. Since it was based on a 4-koma, most of the jokes were easily set up and didn't hit the mark very well for me. After a while the fact that it was parodying shoujo anime/manga kind of wore off in its novelty. The characters were pretty good though. I mostly liked Chiyo and Nozaki. 6/10

**Kara no Kyoukai 7**

After finishing the series the problem I had was each movie felt so separate. It seemed there was little binding each one together aside from 2 and 7 which are directly connected. This movie in particular was fine. The ending was fairly satisfying. 7/10 for the 7th movie and 7/10 for the series overall.

**Noragami 1-7**

Last week I held a strawpoll here for what I would watch next and Noragami won. It's a pretty fun show that doesn't take itself too seriously. The female MC, Hiyori, is actually pretty funny. The concept is cool too but the plot hasn't advanced *too* much in the 7 episodes.

Funny story though: I was gonna finish this show last night but I got caught up playing 999. The true ending was so engaging that I lost track of time and finally beat the game at 4 am. So if the same writer is writing Punchline in the Spring season then I have high expectations for it.

And since everyone likes voting in polls, vote [here](http://strawpoll.me/3335282) for what I will watch next week and consequently review/talk about in this thread. Nichibros came in 2nd last time but I want to see if that holds up with new shows in the mix.

I'm watching **Gundam Wing**, currently on episode 46 of 49. I really have taken a liking to Gundam, **Zeta** was fantastic. **0079** and **0080**/**0083** too!

I got part two of the **Shinsekai Yori** BDs from my sisters at Christmas.  
I watched it as it was airing, this time it's almost better than the first time. Although the BDs from MVM have some timing issues. Un-synced audio ans such...

I started a series called **Noien** by a recommendation from a user here, it's a bit old but seems quite interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Finished the last few Episodes of **SKET Dance**, amazing comedy show, with really emotional backstories. 

Got way more than I expected, big recommendation!

**Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?**

Overall solid show, gave me a few good chuckles, nothing extraordinary especially after just coming from SKET Dance but pretty good nonetheless.

[AnoHana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9989) Re-watch Complete + Movie
------------------  
I feel that this time I completely understood the story and some subtle things I didn't notice in my first watch. Though I wouldn't recommend watching the movie instead of the anime, it's very well done but it lacks the depth of the anime, I would recommend watching it as a complement of the anime as there are new scenes and dialogue. Scores: Anime 9/10 - Movie 8/10


[Aldenoah.Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22729) Re-watch Complete  
------------------  
Finally convinced my brother to watch this series, he wouldn't watch it unless I would watch it with him so I could answer any questions he had. It seems that he sub estimated the series as he grew impatient to watch "just another episode". He'll binge-watch Part 2 when it finishes its broadcasting. For me it was just a memory refresh so I could start Part 2 without questions of Part 1. Score 8/10.


[Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165) Re-watch  19/26

I re-watch this series every year around this date to start the year laughing.

I Went on a movie spree over the holidays.

**Wolf Children**- I LOVED it. 

**REDLINE**- A more action-y movie but still quite good

**The Girl Who Leaped Through Time**- Do I really have to say anything about this one?

**Five Centimeters Per Second**- It looked pretty, but the story was a bit weak



and then i watched **Madoka Magica**- something I actually hadn't seen yet, even though I've been meaning to watch it for years

**Durarara!! (16-24)**

Did some Durarara!! binge watching yesterday, and was very happy with how the series turned out. I loved all the characters especially Shizuo and Celty. I am super excited for the second season to start. One thing I really liked about the series was that they were able to tie together the huge cast of characters and form an overarching plot. I am a huge fan of character centric stories, and Durarara!! was a treat, easily one of my top ten anime.
>> ARTICLE
Also, sort of a side note, why isint this show talked about more? I hardly hear anything about it here on this sub, If it didn't share the same creators as Baccano! I wouldn't have even known it existed.
>> ARTICLE
Finally watched (and finished) all of **Steins;Gate**, including the movie and specials/ONA. I have to agree with the general opinion that it's a great show.

Also watched the **Redline** movie, which was also really fun to watch.

**Kowarekake no Orgel** was really cute, but watching the OVA and movie version one after another was maybe a bit pointless.

Rewatched the first season of **Yama no Susume**, reminded me how much the character developed from the beginning throughout the 2nd season.

Also finally started **Gintama** (Jump Festa 2005 special and episode 1 to 4), not quite sure yet what to think of it. Reminds me a lot of goofy 90s show so far and the jokes are good.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished **CowBoy Bebop** and it was kinda hit and miss for me. It looked great and was original, but I wasn't a big fan of the characters nor the episodic nature of the show. I'm not against episodic shows as a whole, but rather some parts about what Cowboy Bebop did with that. What really bugged me about the episodic aspect of the show is how Spike kept getting in to near-death situations throughout the series and the show wanted the viewer to actually care about them. It was very clear [after episode five and throughout the whole series](/s that Spike was not going to die till the final episode. In episode give, if Spike could be shot multiple times, fall through a window out to what looks to be a second story building, and still be alive, then I had no reason to take any of the other near-death situations seriously; especially considering when episode six started he was perfectly fine.) While I could appreciate the comedy aspects and the one-episode characters the fact that the main characters had some attitude problems and the show kept trying to act like the main characters were in danger when they really weren't put a damper on nearly every episode for me. 
>> ARTICLE
**Toradora!** (ep23-25)  
Felt a bit rushed in the end. I had the feeling they wanted to achieve too much in too short of a time, but still one of the better romcom's out there. (Rating: 8,5/10. 8 on MAL)

**Kyousou Giga** (ep2)  
The first 2 episodes have been a blast to watch. This show is pretty busy though, so it's nothing I can watch while being distracted.

**Tsukimonogatari** (ep1-4)  
Decent installation in the franchise that gave a better glimpse into Araragi which the show overall profits from. That first 15min though (   ). (Rating: 8/10)
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching NGE and I've been enjoying it a lot more than I would have ever expected to. Who knew an old show about robots with a questionable art style would be so good? Very interesting stuff. I also watched the third Madoka movie last night which was kind of an awful experience...but still very good.

Don't forget to watch the director's cut versions of episodes 21-24 and End of Evangelion after 25-26.

**Jintai episodes 1-2**
I've only started this series recently and found out that this anime is probably the most hilariously fucked up show that I've ever watched so far (I'm planning on watching Parasyte later to see if it compares). The humor and presentation are both handled very from what I've seen so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.

School starts tomorrow, going back to 1 anime per week :(

Anyway

**Kokoro Connect (+ OVAs)**

Better than expected. Feel like it deserves an 8, but I'd love to give it a 9. There was no real explanation as to what that guy/girl/thing was, and the timing in which something happened was too convenient. I like to think the guy was controlling all that though. That's what stops me.

Iori best girl, fuckers.

8/10

**Tsukimonogatari**

3rd best in the monogatari series imo. Was really good from start to finish. Even the shower. God damn I was needing some monogatari

9/10

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren**

Finally decided to watch it, and I got to say, it was not as good as the first season. I don't think Chu2-byo is anything amazing but I felt kinda disappointed. There was no real development in their relationship, and some scenes felt out of context. 

6/10

A while back I dove into the gundam series and finished Gundam 0079's movie trilogy and so I've moved on to Gundam Zeta. 

**Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam 50/50**

I really enjoyed this one but I did have a few issues with it. I feel like many characters were completely unlikable and annoying. My biggest problem with it's characters would probably be with it's female cast.[](/s "It felt like the majority of them (with the exception of emma) only existed to be a love interest, manipulated or killed off. ")

[](/s "Jerid was extremly annoying and it felt like he was only there for kamille to have a rival. His character dosen't really have any depth to it and the only development he gets is to hate kamille more and more as time goes on.") 

[](/s "Katz was another extremely irritating character in this show. He would constantly launch without orders ended up helping sarah escape, and continuously disobey orders. He wouldn't have been so bad if he would actually learn from his mistakes like kamille but he didn't. From beginning to end katz was the same annoying kid who shouldn't have been let on the ship in the first place.")


Even with those issues I still really liked it. There were many memorable moments in the show, the other charaters like Kamille, Amuro and [Possible Spoiler](/s "Char") were great, the art and animation looks good for it's age and it's soundtrack is really good as well. **(7/10)**

I've also started ZZ Gundam and 08th MS Team.

[Pale Cocoon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/770/Pale_Cocoon)- This single episode-length OVA was definitely interesting, with it's gloomy futuristic setting. For some reason I want to compare parts of it with Wall-E but to explain why I'd have to ruin the big reveal at the end, and that's no fun. 

In honor of today being the first Sunday of 2015, I decided it would be a good idea to re-watch episode 3 of Kamisama no Inai Nichinyoubi.  ^^It ^^wasn't. 

And lastly, but arriving 100 years too early for it to be least, I watched episodes 26-52 of Gintama. No further words are needed. 

>> ARTICLE
Watched the first two episodes of Bakemonogatari yesterday. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I love the aesthetic and the setting and I generally love artsy anime, but I can't help but feel that I'm missing something important about the writing. I'll probably continue to watch until I figure that out or start to enjoy it more.

Are you watching subbed or dubbed? If dubbed idk, but if subbed try to find a sub that has editors notes or whatever. A lot of the wordplay is based on Japanese homophones and common mishearings and it really helps understand the depth of character interactions.

I watched Hajime no Ippo all 3 seasons. It's pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
I finished watching Phantom: Requiem for a Phantom and I was a little bit disappointed... [if the ending credits hadn't shown] (/s "Zwei being shot it would've been a much better ending imo, and his death paired with Ein laying down and smiling at the sky just didn't make any sense... I mean, if the guy I said was my reason for living was just shot I wouldn't lay down and smile at the sky..."). Otherwise it was a decent anime. I really liked the sound track except some weird moaning in the second half. The other thing that made it hard to rate highly was the time skip and characters ages. [I mean,] (/s "you're telling me that Zwei was fucking Claudia at age 14-16 and living by himself with a 12 year old and then 2 years later Zwei is still young enough to be in high school and Cal looks like a 20+ year old?") After writing this I feel like I should lower the MAL score I gave it...
>> ARTICLE
**Gosick (24/24)**

Hard to not compare to Hyouka as they are quite similar. I really liked the setting in Gosick and ofcourse Victorique. The ending was more satisfying in Gosick but Hyouka was more impressing in it's animation. I'm glad though they decided to stick with the same op for Gosick since it was really good. 8/10

**Kyoukai no Kanata (12/12)**

I love Kyoto Animation. 12 episodes felt too little time to get really into it though. I was suprised how well KyoAni pulled off the action scenes and the plot twist was *interesting*. I liked the characters but there can ofcourse be only one [best girl](http://i.minus.com/ibja9JebmdgzfC.gif). 8/10

**Eve no Jikan (6/6)**

This was one of the most positively suprising anime I've watched. It's quite short and a slice of life so don't expect not much in way of plot. And if you can get over the weird camera movement, you'll most likely enjoy it. What the show does really well is the relations between humans and androids. So if you like Sci-Fi and SoL this is a must watch. 9/10

**Maoyuu Maou Yuusha (12/12)**

I went into this thinking it was full of fanservice and that's it but I was proven wrong. There was suprisingly talking about medieval agriculture, inventions and some economics. Sadly the whole show felt really rushed. A lot of thing were left unexplained like how the magic works and I would've liked to know more about the mage. I don't know if they're planning to make more of this since the ending felt more like a midpoint. 7/10
>> ARTICLE
Rewatched Campione! because I found the light novel. The whole 'gods and deities' premise was pretty interesting, but it felt fairly rushed (which is no surprise since it has a lot of stuff in the LN as opposed to only having 13 episodes). The only thing I can say otherwise is that it probably has one of the best sex scenes in an anime without showing any actual pornographic material (idk how that works, but some people like that, right?).

1-22 of S-CRYED.

Started this up on a whim this past week mostly because I heard it was mindless and it's done by Sunrise. I have to say I'm loving it so far. The first half was iffy but still lots of fun. The second half though has been fantastic with the last episodes getting better and better. The action is pretty top notch as a whole. I really like the character designs too as they are done by the same guy who did Infinite Ryvius and apparently Gundam Seed too even though I haven't seen that. The character development is pretty great too as well. As a whole I'd certainly recommend it as a fantastic and very professionally done action anime. The animation isn't really beautiful as it's pretty old now. It's still very satisfying to watch though. The last few episodes have been a bit of a feels trip as well.
>> ARTICLE
I finished **Ano Hana** (or Ano hi no mita hana bla bla bla) for the first time, and **Toradora!** for the second time, first time dubbed (I was a bit behind on the /r/anime Christmas rewatch, usually don't watch dubs, but this one was pretty good IMO).

I liked Ano Hana a lot, but was expecting the 'feels' a bit too much, I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been quite so expectant the whole time.

Toradora! is great as always, though I still hate Ami with a passion.

I've also been watching **Nichijou** for the first time, this week I watched eps. 17-20 (Coalgirls finally finished their release, had watched up to 16 earlier). This series is pure gold.
>> ARTICLE
**Golden Boy**: it was mentioned on this sub at one point and saw that was only 6 eps it was worth a watch. It was very entertaining and funny at the same time is worth a watch if you got time.

**Death Note**: awesome just got to the point where [major spoilers](/s "Light regains the Death Note as this was all part of his plan.") It is my favorite part of death note so far and cant wait to finish the rest.

**Stardust Crusaders**: Was an excellent ride for what it is. Imo Battle Tendency is still better than what stardust Crusaders is but we'll have to wait for the second season to see what it brings. S2 hype.

**NGE**: Loving Evangelion so far. Hard to explain what what as like about it. It might be the [ep.11  spoiler](/s "the battle with the angel where Rei Shinji and Asuka had to work together in ep. 11 which is my favortie part so far."")
 
**Nisemonogatari**: there is always time for Araragi. Only 4 eps in but ive enjoyed it more overall than bakemonogatari (but its still good).

**Fairy Tail**: Yay Done with the damn filler arc. this next arc looks really promising.

**TTGL Lagann-hen**: finally got around to this since i wasnt the biggest fan of the second half in TTGL. I really enjoyed this more than in anime and was glad i watched it.

**K-on!!**- my favorite slice of life anime behind Durarara. I just enjoy it so much that watching it put a big smile on my face.

*Copying from another thread:*

**Minami-ke Tadaima (1-10/13)** a.k.a. Season 4. In the past few weeks I finished Seasons 2 and 3, and man did they ever let me down. Season 2 was basically an attempt at creating actual drama, which didn't work because as the message that pops up before every episode in Season 1 says, "This is just a plain depiction of the days of the lives of the three Minami sisters. Please don't expect too much". Season 3 was a bit better in that respect. It only had occasional bouts of drama, some of which actually surprised me by turning into actually funny jokes, so it wasn't all bad. Season 4, however, was a different story, in both the literal and figurative sense of the word.

I first noticed the change when watching the season-bridging OVA Minami-ke Omatase. This was the first installment in the series that was animated by Studio Feel and directed by Keiichirou Kawaguchi. The comedy in this OVA was totally different from the 3 previous seasons, and I found it neither funny nor endearing. The same staff then did Minami-ke Tadaima, i.e. Season 4, so it went about as well as I expected. Here's a few paragraphs I wrote while watching the first 4 episodes of Season 4:

Minami-ke has a few running gags that involve characters mistaking the genders of certain other characters. The show constantly teases resolutions and punchlines to these gags, but nothing ever happens. And that's kinda what the show itself is. Season 1 was hilarious to me, because the jokes were all new. Season 2 was boring. Season 3 had some funny moments but was still a step down, and Season 4 is almost as bad as Season 2. Yet I still keep hoping that someone will pop out and say "just kidding, here's the real sequel".

The main problem I have with the later seasons is that the characters get very stale. This is evident in the first episode of Season 4, where the funniest character was the completely new side character, and in the second episode of the same season, where the funniest characters were old side characters that never got much screen time in the past(the same characters who were responsible for the funniest scene in Season 3).

I think the reason for this is partially in the nature of the jokes. In Season 4, some of the jokes have the same structure as the jokes in Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and Joshiraku, i.e. a theme(a concept, word or phrase) is picked and the characters then try to exploit that theme in various ways for comedic effect. In the two aforementioned shows, which are both based on manga by Kouji Kumeta, this kind of humour somehow works, but in Minami-ke it just falls flat. Relying on only one very specific theme in each scene makes the scenes feel tedious instead of funny, and all sense of comedic timing is lost.

In addition, Season 4 brings back some jokes from Season 1. In the shows defence, these jokes were probably reused not because the writers(or maybe the original mangaka) ran out of jokes, but because these were some of the funniest jokes in Season 1. In any case, however, the old jokes simply fail to work, because theyre blended with, or immediately preceded by, the tediously unfunny kinds of jokes that are the standard in Season 4.

So yeah, that's what the first 4 episodes were like for me. What makes it even more disappointing is the fact that I trusted the MAL scores for all the seasons, which give the impression that Season 1 is good, 2 and 3 are terrible, and 4 is about as good as 1. I trudged through Seasons 2 and 3 in the hope of finding a great final season, but instead I found nothing. Also, contrary to what I believed when I started the show, there is actually no noticable passage of time between or during the seasons. The characters stay about the same age and attend the same levels of school across the seasons(which confuses me, because the show has at least 2 different christmas episodes).

However, as bad as I think Seasons 2 and 4 are, I still recommend watching Seasons 1 and 3. Those who don't care about skipping seasons can watch 3 without losing much context, and those who do care can still always watch Season 1. Also, Seasons 2 and 4 are not 100% terrible(Season 2 actually manages to pull of emotion at certain moments and Season 4 features the return of Sensei and Ninomiya-kun), so those who have a lot of time and nothing to do may find something they enjoy even in the inferior seasons. And keep in mind that my impressions of Season 4 are still only based on the first 4 episodes, so it can technically still get better(though I don't see a reason why it would).

(Side note for those who are interested in the upcoming 2nd season of OreGairu: It's being directed by Kei Oikawa, who directed Season 3 of Minami-ke. I can't immediately say that this is a good thing, but at least it's not the guy who directed Season 4.)

**UPDATE since watching episodes 5-10:** It's still hit and miss, but it does get a bit funnier after Episode 4. Still not worth suffering through Seasons 2 and 3 for, but at least I'm not constantly yawning while watching more episodes now. And some of the old jokes that they bring back actually work, surprisingly.

**Date a live S1&S2**
Kinda lame second season tbh, felt like it was rushed (10 episodes!? You kiddin' me bruh). Didn't really enjoy it *that* much compared to the godly first season, which was great and didn't feel rushed for me at all. However, despite season 2 not being so great, the OVA for season 2 was 11/10 better than season 2 itself. Looking past the horrendous subs (until it got re-subbed) it was a nice side story about Kurumi's feelings towards Shido, and I got 30 minutes of best girl time. This OVA probably beat any other anime I've ever watched (though step up your animation game plis). Currently now I'm reading the LN's in case of no season 3, and anyway the LN is also really good. Looking forward to the movie and hopefully season 3.

**Psycho Pass S1**
Ayy great show! Worked my mind a lot and Makishima was such a great villian for the story. There's not much else I can say about this other than the fact that it's great. 

**5 ~~Feels~~ centimeters per second**
Okay, this doesn't really count as a *anime* per say but it's a great work of art. Feels train because it really relates to real life and how people have to get over things or else they'll miss a lot of opportunities in life, which our MC learns at the end.

I've gone into make high school anime mode finishing Haganai last night and My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU two days ago. Both are hilarious. I loved each character from SNAFU especially the yaoi girl and the monologues from Hikki are brilliant.
The characters is Haganai are also entertaining, but I didn't enjoy most of the humor from Sena. I'd say SNAFU is a must see and Haganai is more of a "when I want to laugh show"

Little Busters! Refrain: Oh my god... I marathoned the first season 6 months  ago specifically with the purpose of watching Refrain, which I heard was outstanding. Somehow with the mediocrity of the first season, I just plain put refrain on the back-burner. REFRAIN WAS AMAZING. I completely understand that first season needed to be what it was, and it set up refrain perfectly. I still have a tonne of gripes on S1, but given that it's a 1 cour, I think refrain delivered as well as it could while covering the major plot points.

Little Busters! EX: Because why not just finish the whole thing. These were a whole lot of side stories that take place both before and after the refrain plot. They were all unnecessary and it was for the most part pretty average, but it was really nice to get one last bit with all the characters. Saya Best Girl.

Yuyushiki: Ah deadpan delivery, I think this was recommended to me after watching Yuru Yuri, and it really feels like a similar comedy style. While some of the jokes fell flat (although admittedly it could be some language or culture-based jokes that I was unaware of), there were still plenty of laughs to be had, and was a great change of pace from the other shows I was watching.

To Love-Ru, To-Love Ru OVA, Motto To Love-Ru: This was an odd ball. The show progressively gets better as the seasons go on. And not a small amount, every addition always seems to be a HUGE improvement to me. That being said, it's essentially an Ecchi-fest, with all the jokes essentially driven by perverted situations. And I was laughing throughout the whole thing. Starting Into Darkness now, and I can already tell that once this is done, it'll be a long wait before Darkness 2nd.

Ro Kyu Bu!: None of these girls act remotely their age. I'm constantly asking myself how any of these girls could be in elementary school. They have some ecchi jokes that I am more willing to let slide if they were older, but at this age, it's just... awkward. Which is a shame too, cuz when they get to the motivations of the characters and develop their characters (and the occasional actual basketball) it's a real treat. But a lot of the ecchi-ness is just too much.

Gintama (1-36): This show took me a WHILE to warm up to. It is a highly ranked anime on MAL, and I was really just not getting it. I found myself frequently just shutting off my brain altogether, and not relaly knowing what was going on at all. Then the hotpot episode came up, and the whole show just clicked, and I just bought into the whole show and it's zaney situations. That being said though, they also have the voices for Kon and Taiga, and I can't seem to forget that. 

Good week!

**Monster (10/74)**  
This is really interesting so far. The premise is great, and it's one wonders with the development of the side characters. It's also probably one of the most realistic anime I've ever seen. However, the pacing is incredibly slow, which does make it a bit difficult to watch.

**Corpse Princess (7/13)**  
This is, well ... not that great. The action sequences are awesome, but the show does a pretty bad job of explaining the dynamics of the world, and I have very little idea of why something is supposed to be significant or not.

**Toradora (14-25/25)** Finally finished my rewatch of one of the greatest romance anime of all time, although it was a little late for the Christmas Rewatch Club. This time around i could understand a lot more of the cryptic dialogue that ranged from metaphoric to downright unreliable (depending on the speaker). My only gripe would be [spoilers](#s "Episode 24's proposal scene that was made into a comedic gag. I personally think that scene could have had a big emotional punch but instead all that potential was wasted on tsundere gags. That and Takasu's outrage towards his mother was downright surprising.") Those quirks aside, I still thought it was as good as I remembered it, and I stand by my original score of **9/10**.

I *finally* got around to starting **Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood (1-6/64)** and boy is it great. It's kind of nostalgic because it really reminds me of watching pokemon as a kid because of its bright open world. I think the Al and Edric are two fantastic characters and I'm really interested to see how they try to repair their bodies. I also can't forget the amazing OST, because it really helps shape the world and the tone of the series. The OP and ED is as great as everyone said it would be. [spoilers](#s "plus all those "doggy-Nina" jokes make a lot more sense").

I've started **Kemono no Souja Erin** recently. (25/50)

Apparently it's ranked very high, however I've never seen anybody on this subreddit talk about it. The show's been such an interesting ride, and with a FANTASTIC opening song from Sukima Switch.

For those of you who are interested in a relaxed fantasy setting similar to Spice and Wolf, and an adventure anime featuring an awesome female MC, I'd recommend you check this show out.

**K-On!** - Started watching this over the winter break. All the episodes are really funny, and the songs are pretty good.

**Cowboy Bebop** (rewatch) - This was the first anime I ever watched. Now that it's been released on Hulu, I decided to rewatch the episodes. Last time, I watched the dubs, so this time I watched the subs. I've also been following along with the reviews on [overthinkingit.com](http://www.overthinkingit.com/2014/12/25/overthinking-cowboy-bebop-sessions-25-26/), and it's really changed my appreciation of the show.

**Spice and Wolf** - Just started watching this yesterday. Never would have thought an anime about medieval economics could be so fun to watch. I watched the first five episodes and then spent some time afterwards figuring out how the deal with the Trenni silver coins works.

**Kuroko no Basket S1&S2**


I was blown away by how much I enjoyed this show. I had watched Haikyuu!!  When it had aired and thought no sports anime could be as good as this.  Boy,  was I wrong. Kuroko has everything that Haikyuu!!  Does in terms of likeable characters, formidable opponents, etc. Some people wouldn't like Kuroko for the "super powers"  but I think it makes it just more fun and interesting. Some of the powers are so ridiculous I just love it. For example the full court shooting range. Anyway it was an extremely enjoyable show and I can't wait for S3. Seirin Fight! 
>> ARTICLE
I been finishing **Kaiji** all week. I can say that it's one of my top anime of all time because of how amazing and intense the plot is. Kaiji is best moe character. I really recommend this series if you don't mind the very slow pacing. It has about two seasons with 26 episodes each.

**Hagure Yuusha no Estetica**

Heh. A hero returns victorious from slaying the evil demon-lord, and goes back to school in his world. Somehow, the problems there jut aren't as big a deal for him.

Hilariously overpowered MC with a penchant for stealing underwear from women while they wear it. Great fun. 
>> ARTICLE
**D-Fragments** Pretty good comedy, a bit on the silly side but still entertaining. Some great dialogue that really made me laugh. Left me wanting another season.

**Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse** Started out great, animation was amazing, but dropped off part way through. The story then shifted to 80% character dev/harem building and only 20% sci-fi/mecha for a number of episodes, but ended with some reasonable action. They added too many girls all drooling over the MC and it detracted from the overall story. The premise was great (Alien invasion, extermination of human race, giant mecha to fight back, etc) but overall it just missed the mark. Still watchable but it could have been so much more.

**White Album 2** I kept putting this one off despite numerous recommendations because I thought I needed to watch White Album first. Turns out they aren't really connected, so I skipped WA and went straight to WA2. Overall it was a good romance though I wasn't a fan of the ending. It has solid character development and some touching scenes... starts slow but picks up. I'm glad I watched it and I'd recommend it for anyone wanting a romance anime...

**No Game No Life**


I watched 2 episodes yesterday night before going to bed (thinking that it's actually a good show which reminds me of lelouch of code geass) and finished the series today making me craving for more episodes. literally no no game no life no life. 
>> ARTICLE
Decided this time around i would go for unusual type of genres and older style type of animes.

**Completed:**

[Kashimashi: Girls Meet Girl](http://myanimelist.net/anime/667/Kashimashi:_Girl_Meets_Girl) (12/12) + Ova

Decent show, its about a guy who got rejected by a girl, after becoming heart broken he decided to walk up a mount in which he got hit by a spaceship that killed him and got resurrected back as a girl. Its story about love, friendship and learning about becoming a girl after being a boy. It was a decent show; however, the ending was a little rush so it wasn't as enjoyable towards the end of the show unlike the start of it. Which was a strong contender. 

[Highschool DxD:](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11617/High_School_DxD) Season 1 (12/12) + Ova's (2/3) + Season 2 (12/12)

Plot, so much bloody plot. I really enjoy this show for its story that it brought. besides from the plot that it does introduce and show off. I have to say each eps kept me wanting keep wanting more. SO it was an easy contender to marathon the entire series from start to finish with season 1 and 2.

[Aishiteruze Baby](http://myanimelist.net/anime/102/Aishiteruze_Baby%E2%98%85%E2%98%85): (26/26)

A story about a delinquent teenager that gets put on the spot of responsibility to look after a 5 year old, while along the way learning life lessions of love, family and responsibility. Good show if you enjoyed [Usagi Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10162/Usagi_Drop). 

[Accel World](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11759/): (24/24) + Ova

I tried to get into the show awhile ago with sword art online season one finishing. To be honest, i couldn't at first because of the way the protag character in general. With the ending of sword art online 2 and hopefully future adaptions, i decided to give it another ago, to understand more behind the next arc of sword art. The first thing i noticed i had to do was get over who the MC was and acknowledge that he an annoying little shit and that is all. After that, the show actually became really enjoyable, which became easier to marathon towards the end. 
>> ARTICLE
**Kamisama Hajimemashita (1-2/13)**
Started this one after seeing it premieres tomorrow and it had gone forgotten on my to-watch list from last season. Not sure it's a masterpiece or anything so far, but it's definitely enjoyable and if it keeps up, I plan to stick around for the second season.

**Sakasama no Patema**
I've been starting to watch several anime movies after the top 100 list that was recently posted, and this was one of them. Like the reviews say, not an amazing story per se, but it works, and it has some gorgeous visuals and a great pair of main characters.

**[Baccano!](https://hummingbird.me/anime/baccano) (2/13)**

I currently feel a little lost with all the characters and jumping back and forth, but that was something I was expecting after reading reviews of the show. I'll probably have to rewatch it to fully grasp the story and things I missed but so far I like how different and unique the cast is. Also the soundtrack, wow.
>> ARTICLE
**Monster (3/74)**

I knew this one was going to be good based on how it's talked about but have been hesitant to jump in due to the length. I was surprised at how strong it starts off, was expecting a slow burn, and ended up watching three episodes instead of just the one. It seems pretty obvious what happened and I'm curious to see where they'll take the show over the numerous episodes.

**Nagi no Asukara (16/26)**

After the time skip my interest in the show has been lagging a bit. I'm trying to make it over the hump, and I really did love the first 10 eps or so, but the timeskip as well as the shift in character focus is challenging.
>> ARTICLE
Currently re-watching **Hikaru no Go** and am on episode 61. Oh God, I just passed the episode [where](/s "Sai disappears"). </3 I've been dreading re-watching that particular episode since near the beginning of my re-watch.

I gotta say, this is my 3rd time watching this series. I first watched it way back in high school (around 2005 or so, if I remember right), then watched it again in 2010 when I was Internet-less and bored, and now again. It's telling when a 75-episode series about a board game I don't even understand holds my interest for the third time, all the way through.

The writing, the characters, the pacing...it's all done so well. The story progresses at a good pace, there's always something - whether it's a casual game between rivals or a big title/tournament match - to look forward to. The characters themselves are so fascinating to watch. There's the eager and somewhat bratty Hikaru, the serious and ambitious Akira, and the *go*-obsessed ghost Sai (who fluctuates adorably between dead serious and incredibly goofy and immature). Akira, the *go* child prodigy, chases after Sai, thinking it's actually Hikaru, while Hikaru, a *go* n00b, chases after Akira. Sai, while acknowledging Akira's strength, looks to Akira's father, the current top *go* player in Japan, as his rival, although being a ghost, he has no real way of challenging him. It's an interesting take on rivalries.

All the characters get their own chance at the spotlight, their own chance to develop as real people do. It's hard to pick a favourite. Even better, the series stretches out over about 4 or 5 years and you literally see the characters gradually grow - both personally and physically. You won't even notice it until, later in the series, they do some flashbacks, and then you'll have realized how much these characters have all grown.

So basically, I'm enjoying the hell out of HnG and, to this day, it remains one of my favourite anime.

My time to shine!

**The World God Only Knows I**: 7. Pretty decent twist on the harem genre, but it didn't really get me excited for more. Still watching the second season, though.

**Evangelion Rebuild 1 and 2**: 8. Fresh coat of paint on a classic. I've heard bad things about the third, so I'm hesitant to watch it.

**Mirai Nikki**: 6. Yuno carried the series until the end, dragging it along through some pretty terrible plot. Still entertaining as fuck, though.

**Sword Art Online I and II**: 6. Great premise, bland characters, and some terrible arcs (looking at you, Caliber). I still cried at the end of Mother's Rosario, though.
>> ARTICLE
Omitted rewatches.

**Finished Recorder to Randoseru Mi (1-13/13)**

It was alright. Decidedly different animation than the first two, and new cast and some better jokes. However, the pacing felt off and the animation *really* didn't suit the type of show it was. Felt off in a couple of ways.

**Finished Baccano! (10-13/13)**

At the beginning, I had my reservations about the show. The way it kept on jumping between times had me frequently lost, trying to grasp at situations and characters to orient myself. That died down a bit at the end and as more of the underlying story was revealed, it began to stitch together very well. Miria and Isaac are quite possibly my favorite comedy relief characters of all time. Their VAs did a top notch job (sub). I'm not sure if I should re-watch at some point with the dub, but I've heard good things about it...

**Finished The Tatami Galaxy (6-11/11)**

Well, by episode 9, I began to get a bit tired of the underlying plot. However, episodes 10 and 11 completely flipped everything around. It brought everything together REALLY WELL. I now see why people who liked it, really liked it.

**Started Durarara!! (1-4/?)**

After finishing Baccano, I found out that the same writer wrote the story for Durarara, and the second season is going to be starting soon, so I decided to start it up. It's a bit early for any of my impressions, but I'm getting a decidedly Baccano-esque feel to it. Again with the interconnected characters and plotlines. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out.

Oh also **Finished Yuru Yuri (11-12/12)**

Ehhh. I'm a fan of moe and comedy, but this didn't really appeal to me. I got kinda of tired after a while, which is why I had it left at 10 out of 12 for quite some time. Now, however, I'm finally done with it. Probably won't watch the second season unless there's a compelling reason to.
>> ARTICLE
The Baccano! dub is legitimately incredible. I would highly recommend it. In my opinion, it's far superior to the sub. It fits the setting better and Isaac and Miria are even funnier dubbed. You should definitely try it when you get a chance.

Mawaru Penguindrum is no straight-forward watch. It's a story filled with symbolism and most things that happen are not literal. It's a big puzzle of metaphors and thematic depth.  
If you happen to rewatch it some time you might be able to appreciate more.

It's definitely no show that you can just watch for pure enjoyment.

**Mawaru Penguindrum** **(1-22/24) minor - somewhat spoilers, don't read if you haven't 

This show could possibly be the definition of *wtf* added to *holyshit* added to *amazing*. Its not quite as subtle as something like **Serial Experiments Lain** in its plot movements but it doesn't want to do that. Mawaru shoves its themes into your face and wants you to accept them. Everything in the show has been seen before but it all works together to create something unique. Like many other shows, Penguindrum also features a jumble of themes in which some are explored pretty well and others kind of not. The show screams at me about a basic portrayal of misdirected revenge and a dysfunctional family. The show also works like Durarara in the regard that EVERYTHING is connected and nothing is left out. The ability to tie things in after separate introductions brings an interesting twist to the show. Everything is a lie. People are two-faced. Most of all though, it's a story about being loved; each character seeks a purpose in life and often find it in being wanted by another. While some of the character designs are outdated somewhat like Ringo and Yuri, I particularly like Yuri's design. She  almost looks like the epitome of perfection. And frankly those who have seen Penguindrum know, she's not. I absolutely love Himari's design. As I have said before, Penguindrum doesn't give a single shit about subtlety; it shoves everything in your face. The show consistently breaks the 4th wall by entertaining meta jokes and also by labeling common storytelling methods like flashbacks. Honestly, the reception to this commonly labeled "pretentious attitude" is hit or miss. I personally LOVE it. It may not be the best way to craft a standard narrative but since when has Penguindrum given a shit about standard? I've never been too keen on foreshadowing or any standard measured in high school english class so I'm not qualified enough to consider Penguindrum pure shock material but I'd love if anybody would point out some hints of the twists. I was thinking about doing a write-up about this series because I'm just blown away but I'm kind of lazy :p. The slow start doesn't do this show justice at all! I'm still wondering how sane I am writing all this shit up rather than finishing up this series. Atm, I'm anywhere between a 8-10/10 for this show.

Finished the first 38ish episodes of **Hunter x Hunter**. It's pretty good! I had my first "fuck yeah" moment while watching it when [spoilers](/s "Gon punches Hisoka in the face for the first time"), I might've accidentally yelled "GET FUCKED".

Started watching Steins;Gate on the first. Took me long enough.

Damn is it great so far. Episode 6 right now.

I also started my annual rewatch of NGE a little late, since I am now showing it to my brother. 

Also, I am showing my little brother and sister Cowboy Bebop since I got the complete series for Christmas. They don't want to stop watching (They are ages 14 and 12, if anyone is interested)

So, I've been doing 2 rewatches and watching Steins;Gate, which I've been wanting to watch for forever now, but wanted to finish what I was watching at the time, and then wound up watching Bokurano, Baccano, and Angel Beats as part of my winter watches.

**Welcome to the NHK** - I loved this one. I finished it only a couple of minutes ago actually. I was extremely disappointed by the ending however, as it really didn't do the show justice for how great it was.

**Nekomonogatari: Kuro** - It was pretty good. I can't say a lot about it that wouldn't echo what I said about Bakemonogatari however. Bakemonogatari is still the best in the series IMHO.

**Monogatari Second Season** - Only finished Tsubasa Tiger so far, but it is one of my favourite arcs.

**Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu** - Can I stop yet? Please? I don't wanna sit through this. No? Okay... (I'm only on episode three and I honestly love and hate this one)

I just caught up on Hunter x Hunter and I'm rewatching Deadman Wonderland and Durarara (the season 2 hype is real).
>> ARTICLE
Toradora. Really really good. 
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Ro-Kyu-Bu. Story is interesting to watch and I like the characters in the anime. I just hope I didn't arrested yet.

Started rewatching **TTGL** (4/26) the other day but have been focusing more on **Hunter x Hunter** (60/148) lately. It's good, never would have expected myself to watch this much!
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Anohana yesterday. Would recommend it to anyone who loves crying. 
>> ARTICLE
No game no life. I enjoyed it!
>> ARTICLE
I watched all of **I Can't Understand what my Husband is Saying** because I really wanted to watch it with my non-otaku girlfriend but I couldn't resist, and now I'm watching **Fate/Zero**, I think it's pretty good but there's just so much more **Fate/ ** stuff to watch
>> ARTICLE
Berserk. Absolutely fantastic.

Watched 117 episodes of hxh this week. I had a slow week. Hxh is good.

Anohana (Rewatch)

Dog Days (Rewatch)

Love both of these series so much

>> ARTICLE
Binged the entirety of Shingeki no Kyojin yesterday along with the OVAs because I wanted to see what was so good about it and I'm in denial of my break ending.  

Needless to say, I'm a fan and can't wait for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
**Tokyo Ghoul (12/12)**      
Welp, that was interesting. I decided to watch it because my friend recommended it to me. I thought a ghoul was some sort of ghost or something. Pretty good series, can't wait for season 2 this week.   
  
**Seitokai Yakuindomo (12/12)**   
I did not know what I expected. So many dick jokes! Student council president is best girl!   
  
**K-On! (1-5/13)**  
I just started this today. Great show!     

I also finished some OVAs and specials that were in my backlog.
>> ARTICLE
bakemonogatari,  I'm confused. 
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann, Madocka Magica, Psycho Pass season 1, Terror in Resonance, Fate Zero and Steins;Gate. Thought admittedly only Terror in resonance, Madocka Magica and Gurren Lagann were initial watches with the others being repeat watchings.  

Edit: I forgot No Game No Life as an initial watch as well. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished both seasons of Darker than Black + OVAs and all i can say is I NEED MORE
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Steins;Gate. Such a great show.
>> ARTICLE
Watched the entirety of Amagi Brilliant Park in one sitting. Loved it! Highly recommended!
>> ARTICLE
**Mondaijitachi ga Isekai Kara Kuru Sou Desu yo**

recommended on MAL for NGNL. 3 kids get transported to another world to play games that bet anything. they help a community (guild/group) that was stripped of its name to build up their power and rank again. It was left kind of open ended with only 10 episodes and I assumed never got renewed. A shame. If you like OP MC's, this is your ticket. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm binge watching Bacanno and I've just finished episode 8. It's a pretty solid series, and since I had finished Durarara a few weeks ago the similarities between the two are just uncanny. 
It's a great series so far, and from what I hear it's one of those shows  that deserves another season but never got one. That's unfortunate :\
>> ARTICLE
**Is the order a rabbit? (12/12)**

Absolutely adorable.

**Blood Lad (10/10 +OVA)**

Awesome. Needs a season 2.

**Haruhi (14/28)**

Didn't know there were different orders to watch it in or that it was split into 2 seasons. Not really liking it.

**Deadman Wonderland (12/12 + OVA)**

Pretty good. Really feels like there should have been more at the end.

**Gonna watch: The rest of Haruhi**

Don't really want to but I don't have anything else in mind to watch. Also feel like I should finish it. Is "Endless Eight" as bad as I've heard, and can I just skip around it?

sakurasou rewatch club :) and i marathoned one piece to try and catch up... but theres just too many episodes not enough time.

[Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21405/Bokura_wa_Minna_Kawaisou)

All I can say is Ritsu is best girl.


[Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12175/Koi_to_Senkyo_to_Chocolate)

Was actually a pleasant surprise, was expecting a typical stupid cliche harem at first. However MC chooses the (IMO) most interesting, but fucked up girl and the whole school politics behind it was pretty interesting. Over the top? Yes. Cliche? Yes. Interesting? Hell yes.

Angel beats

i cried for an hour after the last episode
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching ***Ben-To.*** Hot damn is it good, like, the concept is asinine as hell but they make it seem so serious and grand I can't help but laughing.

The entire premise of the show is "fight club with lunchables."
>> ARTICLE
I watched the entire 20 **Nisekoi** episodes today. I regret it, because I was hyped for the ending, [but](/s "didn't know there'd be a second series after and that they'd end it as open as that").

I think I'll watch either **Tokyo Ghoul** next, but I just don't know where I can watch it uncensored...
>> ARTICLE
Knights of Sidonia has been an interesting one. The CG for the character models is honestly kinda horrendous, it could really turn you off trying it.

I, however, can absolutely say that it is well worth the watch for the set pieces and fights alone. It is also hard sci-fi, which is rare. 
>> ARTICLE
**Bleach 1-4/366**

For muh nostalgia pretty much. Obviously, I'm watching an episode a day, that way I'll have the series finished within the year. Based [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt4r932kYvM). **[nobody knows who I really am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tFfDMvwxpc)/10**

**Fairy Tail 74-77/175**

It's days like this where I really wish they still played the third [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_5zSQjRIHs). **Better times, man/10**

**Kaiba, literally just 9/12**

I liked it more when it was more focused on world building. **Yuasa's still based for ping pong/10** 

**Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei 1-5/26**

This anime is pretty stupid, but done well, at least to me. I usually hate jesus-kun anime, but it's actually rather enjoyable. Also, sweet OST. **>tfw no creepy imouto/10**

>> ARTICLE
finished **Psycho Pass** today actually, after rewatching **Kill la Kill** over the holidays  
Psycho Pass was really good, and Makishima was a fantastic old-fashioned villian-type character. Only problem was the CG.  
Kill la Kill had a good soundtrack but the tracks were used half-assed-ly and the last 4 episodes were really bad.
>> ARTICLE
I watched all of  **Samurai Champloo**,it was really, really good. It might be because I am in love with Watanabe's work, but it's now in my top 10.

Just finished up Jin Roh and My Neighbor Totoro. They were sitting on my backburner for awhile now, they have aged very well.

I'm watching **kotoura-san** right now. I'm getting close to the end. It's actually really good, better than I thought it would be going in.

Plus I'm almost done **The Devil Is a Part Timer**. Both are gr8

I was watching  **Utena**  and  **Penguindrum**  last week ... Man, that was good stuffs ...

no. 6. It was pretty good, really liked the post apocalyptic feeling 
>> ARTICLE
I watched Aoi Bungaku after the depressing shows recommendation. I tried starting the first arc a couple of time and it never really clicked with me, but I skipped the first four episodes to try the rest. I'm glad I did, because "Run, Melos" was pretty damn great.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Durarara while on holiday. I'd heard a lot of about it, but I finally bit the bullet as it was the only show I had on my laptop. I'm so glad I did because it is amazing!
>> ARTICLE
**Hunter x Hunter (99-117)**

I'm slowing down on Hunter compared to last week. The introduction to the Queen arc was amazing but now it feels like it's slowing down just before the conclusion.

Code Geass and Toradora! They were both great

Hanasaku Iroha. Just absolutely amazing.

I just finished Air for the first time. Why did have to be so emotional at the end.

I'm getting caught up on my backlog..still.  I got five episodes into "The Irregular At Magic Highschool" and had to stop.  The incest jokes are pretty bad, it wouldn't be so awful, if they didn't try playing it up every other episode or so.  Lots of issues with this series; I probably won't complete watching until the end.

Trigun(0-26/26)- absolutely loved it. I still have to watch the movie, though.

Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo(0-24/24)- loved it. That graduation scene fucking hurt, man. I knew it would, but not that much.


>> ARTICLE
Macross 7!

I'll have Planet Dance stuck in my head for a few weeks I bet, but the song they introduce is episode 18 or so where the chorus is "Heavy lonely night" is pretty fucking metal.

This one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBExb6om62E

Still can't decide if I like it, I think the way they treat music is dumb compared to other Macross series, but the music is catchy and good so I'll finish it out.

**Gundam Seed Destiny (15/50)**

I just finished **Steins;Gate.** I thought it was going to be a generic scifi show, but the second half kicked those expectations to the curb. 

Also started up **Log Horizon**. I'm starting to warm up to this show.  It doesn't have great animation, it at least has a compelling story. The show also reminds me why I hang out with people in mmos.

Heaven's Memo Pad. Wanted to watch something similar to Hyouka.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (got to Episode 24)**

I really like this anime so far, though I can't say I like how the writers put jokes and gags at wrong moments (emotionally intense scenes). It's a great anime but I can't really see why people gave it a 10/10. To me it's more like a 9/10 so far (though that might change since I haven't even finished half of the show).
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching it too, but almost reached the end 56/64, and yea, it's really great, I think you'll see why it's top1 at MAL and everybody puts 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished love live season 2 and I loved it.

For a change of pace after that I watched psycho-pass and I thought it was outstanding, it had been a while since I had watched something that passionately. Both shows were solid 8/10 
I plan on watching Ghost hound next
>> ARTICLE
**Fate/Zero 10/10**

Holy fuck. So much awesomeness. I came in with high expectations and every one of them were fulfilled. Truly awesome series.

**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun 8/10**

Good series, it provided me with good entertainment. However the end just kind of was. There was nothing specific about it, it just ended with nothing resolved. Which was kind of a bummer.

Kids on the Slope . feels. feels. beautiful music. and feels.
>> ARTICLE
Well so far I've been watching **Space Dandy**, **Neon Genesis Evangelion**, and trying to figure out where I left off watching **Gintama**. Honestly Space Dandy really entertains me, but Evangelion is sorta slow paced and not as amazing as everyone seems to make it out to be. I need to give it some more time but the first three episodes have me annoyed with Shinji. He's kind of a wuss.

Oh, I've also been watching **To Aru Kagaku No Railgun**, and I really love it, but the pacing is kind of slow. I want to see more action and more of the Level 5's (I'm only on episode 16 so maybe there's a lot more in store). Other than that, it's funny and action-oriented and I really like the main character.

Durarara!...  
had to force myself but after episode 10 it kinda sucked me in its such a good show but it starts really slow and the opening and ending are one of my favorites

**Parasyte - The Maxim**

Episode 1

Decent! Sometimes I'll be snobby enough with my taste as to discard an anime based on the title alone. However, a short wikipedia glance convinced me to give it a shot. I like the art style, so definitely going to continue this one, being the art snob that I am. Also has a hint of creepiness/off-putting uneasiness that makes me all the more curious as to what lies within. A 'death note' meets 'walking dead' sort of a feel.

**Barakamon**

episode 1-12

Binge watched. So good. Watched after it was voted anime of 2014. Definitely worth a look.

NGE. I still have no idea wtf happened in the last 4-5 episodes or EoE. Haven't watched the remakes yet.

**Tari Tari 13/13**

Random pick way outside of the sort of stuff I'd normally watch, but I did enjoy it. Bits of it made me think of Cowboy Bebop with a much larger crew and a different sort of feels.  
**Nodame Cantabile 3/23**  
This... this is my jam. It is getting finished pronto.

New year, new show: **Legends of the Galactic Heroes**

I can't believe I discovered the existence of this series barely two weeks ago and I couldn't wait any longer. I'm quite in awe with the writing quality and how the screenwriters managed to alternate the stories of the Empire and the Alliance without losing the viewer's attention. The rumours are true: it's like Game of Thrones meets Star Wars meets any movie starring Bette Davis. Damn, perfect combination of drama, epic battles and political intrigue! The animation is really consistent considering the time of its release, the first shots are beautifully designed.

I'm looking for the users that also said that watching Legend of the Galactic Heroes was their new year's resolution. How's it going? Did you dare or did you pass? I want to share experiences!
>> ARTICLE
Not finished, Trigun. Decided it's time I watch one of the classics. So far (ep 9) Its...kinda okay I guess... Hope it gets better.

It certainly will; takes a bit to get started but it pick up quite well. Make sure to watch the movie after you're done, it's also pretty good!

It will my friend.  It will.

**Tokyo Ghoul (12/12)**
It was better than i expected to be honest. I got a little tired during the last episode at first, but now i can't wait for the 2nd season :)

**Psycho-Pass (20/22)**
Going to finish this one today. Entertaining, but not as good as people made me believe it was, or perhaps it's due to the fact that i'm finishing the show in two days.

**Shonen Onmyouji (01/26)**
Watched the first episode. Didn't quite like it, but i'll watch at least 1 or 2 more and see how that goes.

**Sket Dance (13/77)**
This one's quite enjoyable. Had a lot of fun in most episodes, but since it doesn't really have much of a *main* storyline i probably will use it to fill time while i'm watching something else.

...

It really affects me that all new shows stopped airing during the holidays it seems heh.

Steins;Gate (currently at episode 21)

It really became much better after episode 12. I really like it. 

Luckily I still have 4 episodes to watch, a special and OVA, if I not mistaken.
>> ARTICLE
and you should read the VN too. it has more stuff in it, like other paths. more detailed as well
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even know there was a VN.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's a lot better than the anime because the anime was adapted from the VN. Some things that were in the VN didn't cross over to the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'll take a look at it if I have some free time ;)
>> ARTICLE
It'll take around 30-50 hours to finish all the time lines. It will be worth it though.
>> ARTICLE
:S I don't really have that amount of time. I'll just stick with the Anime for now :S
>> ARTICLE
You don't have to do all the time lines in one sitting. 

You could also download a file that has saves  at the major branching points for the other paths, and that would probably cut it down to like maybe 10-15 hours.
>> ARTICLE
But that kinda ruins the fun.

I only have two hours a day, so it would take me pretty long to finish it. I just don't have the time :/
>> ARTICLE
I'm really excited to get to the later episodes of Steins;Gate, I'm currently on episode 5 and I already think the show is great
>> ARTICLE
Don't skip the ED of ep 22, otherwise ep 23's start will be a touch confusing.
>> ARTICLE
Most Anime have bits after the ED, so I skip the song, and then watch the after bit. So, don't worry ;)
>> ARTICLE
Dont skip the song, ED2 was probably my favorite song from the series (because it was the first song that plays in the VN)
>> ARTICLE
If it is a new ED, I'll watch it. I'm not particularly fond of the ED it has up to where I am now, though.

Its one of those 'End song interrupted' things.

its only on Ep 22 though.

>> ARTICLE
Congratulations! *clap clap clap*
>> ARTICLE
**The Tatami Galaxy**(1/11)

I've only seen one episode of this show so far and goddamn am I pleased. From the art style to the scene direction that utilizes a lot of odd perspectives this one really stands out as ambitious. The narration is fucking absurdly fast, and can be kind of hard to keep up with at times, but following Watashi's stream of consciousness is as funny as it is interesting. The show's comedy seems to be right down my alley, and it seems to be widely regarded that this show's conclusion is really well done. Additionally, I love that it's told in the college setting, which is something that I don't think enough anime do. Maybe I just love this so much because I'm currently in college and I find the show's "find my place in life" direction that it seems to be headed very relatable, but I can already see this one being at the top of my list.
>> ARTICLE
My absolute favorite anime of all time, great to see people watching it. I recommend you watch the series slowly first: Enjoy the episodic nature of the anime, savor the intricacies, and fall in love. Binge, if you must, afterwards.

Enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
Excellent choice! It was one of those shows I just could not stop watching once I'd started. Episode 2 might confuse you a little at first, but things will make sense as you go on.

Definitely one of my favorite shows :)

One of my favorites of all time, if you end up enjoying it go look up other stuff that Masaaki Yuasa has directed (kaiba, kemonozune, ping pong)

**Death Note (37/37)**

I have put off Death note for a long time. Now that I watched it, I miss it. I watched it in three days. I could have watched it in two, but after episode 25, because of certain events I was depressed. But after that I finished it and episodes after 25 were also good. I don't know why people thrashed on it so much. The show is amazing, the dub is on par with Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Story and characters are well written and thought out. It was a perfect series for me to watch.
 **10/10**

**Toradora (9/25)**

Rewatching this makes me feel so nostalgic, it was the third anime I've watched and now I remember why I loved it so much. It is incredible. **9/10**

**Gintama (25-31/201)**

After episode 25 almost every episode was fucking incredible. I watched episode 25 after I watched Death Note and it was funny seeing the whole episode a Death Note reference. **10/10**

>> ARTICLE
and gintama gets much better past those episodes
>> ARTICLE
Most people hate post 25 for Death note. How did you find the two characters [major spoilers](/s "near and mello")specifically and their relevance to the plot?
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Near was fine, but Mello was shit. I liked the second half but not as much as the first.")

**Naruto ep 90**. So far I really enjoyed the chunin arc. The fight between Gaara and Rock Lee was pretty intense. And you might wonder why Im watching Naruto. Naruto seem to be one of the most popular selling mangas in japan and outside of japan. Not to mention that the manga has ended and there will be a last movie. So I figured why not watch it all and see what its all about. (Im not much of a manga reader though, so Id rather watch it). I cant wait till I start watching shippuden. Im pretty sure its gonna be really good. And yes, I will skip all the filler arcs for both naruto and shippuden. 
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes they like to take bits of canon and place them as a minute in a filler episode during a filler arc so sometimes it's necessary to watch part of a filler episode. For some ones later in Shippuden there are some fan-edits that take all the canon scenes from a filler arc and blend them into one episode, but I'm not aware of that being available for earlier occasions.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people tag on Naruto here on r/anime but it is a lot better without the filler. it's still far from perfect but it is enjoyable. 
>> ARTICLE
[**Steins;Gate: Fuka Ryouiki no Dj vu \(the movie\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=11577)

Obviously massive spoilers to the original Steins;Gate, so don't click if you haven't watched the TV series first. This movie is pretty interesting. I would have never expected Okabe [spoilers](/s "to get PTSD which in turn overloads his reading steiner which in turn erases his existence from the Steins;gate world line"). It does work, but I think it would be more plausible, especially if they explained [](/s "how reading steiner by itself can actually move world lines, as in the TV series this was totally not the case, as he was traumatized every world line except steins;gate, but never moved world lines without the use of a time machine/leap/dmail"), so I definitely think this was one of the weaker parts of the movie. The good part, however, is Kurisu Makise. She carried so hard, and unlike Okabe, it only took her [](/s "2 attempts to fix everything. That's like 50 less (idk the actual number) attempts than Okabe."). There was also lots of dialogue and development between the two, and that is always a plus. As for the side characters, they were mostly neglected. Of course, its a movie so time constraints are in play, and they did put in some nice touches like Suzuha's hat, but overall they didn't exist that much. Overall its a decent story, not as intense as the original story but it can definitely stand on its own, and anyone who likes okabe and/or kurisu (aka everyone) should watch this after the main series.

**Death Note (31-37/37)**

Finished watching it and while I don't like last 13 episodes as much as I liked the first 25, I still enjoyed the show immensely, although I'd have preferred a different ending.

**Eureka Seven (1-26/50)**

When I watch this show I get the feeling I should have known more and missed something that was explained before - trapars, LFOs/KLFs, the world itself etc.; it's pretty vague and i guess I'll need to go to the wiki to learn about the world, if they don't explain it before it ends. I do, however, like the idea of surfing through the winds. Half way through the show, and I think I like side characters more then the 2 MCs there. One is jealous, indecisive, full of himself and blames everyone and the other is inexperienced, naive and just generally a kid. I do like the ships crew and how different everyone is. 
>> ARTICLE
i agree with you regarding Eureka Seven, they don't exactly lay out all the aspects of that future world/universe, and you sorta have to figure it out yourself. im 31 episodes in and i really enjoy how nearly all the side characters on the ship undergo some form of development
>> ARTICLE
There's actually a fan made ending on youtube that doctors some footage so it looks like [](/s "Light wins")
>> ARTICLE
They explain some of the setting, but it's not exactly important to understand the setting perfectly - it's more about the characters. The two MCs kinda have to be indecisive and unconfident at the start; it's a coming-of-age story. I'd like to hear what you think once you've finished it.
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see another guy that liked the last episodes. People over exaggerated about them.

**Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) 25/25**

Wow. I went into it not knowing anything about the world/setting/plot other than that there was superpowers and dystopia. It did not disappoint! One of the few I'm willing to give 10/10. I can't really come up with much criticism or things I'd want them to change (some of my other 10/10s are masterpieces but not 'perfect'). I'm glad I wasn't spoiled about any of the deaths, twists, world elements etc.

If you like dystopia, you should watch this!

**Zetsuen no Tempest 3/24**

Hmm, not quite sure what to make of this yet. There seems to be more to Yoshino than first meets the eye, and Mahiro isn't that likeable (though they're both attractive). I'm wondering what the 'battle beyond time and space' aspect means - is there some sort of reverse causality / time travel where Mahiro's sister was killed by a Kusaribe a year ago because Mahiro/Yoshino are now starting to fight against them? That would be cool. I'm still wondering if Mahiro and Yoshino are going to end up on different sides; they aren't exactly the closest of friends, and seem to have different motivations and thought-patterns.

**Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi/Okami-san and her Seven Companions (1-12/12)** - Watched the entirety of Ookami-san over the first half of the week. Turned out to be better than I had originally thought. I had tried watching it before but dismissed it in favor of other shows, but giving it a chance, it turned out to be an enjoyable show with a decent mix of comedy and serious moments. Can definitely recommend it.

**Angel Beats!: Stairway to Heaven** - With my Angel Beats Complete Collection arriving on DVD this Monday, I took the chance to watch the OVA and it was definitely an enjoyable experience. Getting really excited for whatever the big thing Angel Beats is soon to announce is.

**Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni!/Baka and Test: Summon The Beasts 2 (1-3/13)** - Started the second season of Baka and Test with the friend who recommended the first season. Can't say as I've enjoyed the first few episodes as much as I did the first season, I can appreciate the fact that it was shifted to a more romance/slice-of-life focus, but I feel it lost some of the appeal of the first season in the process.

**Toradora! (3-6/25)** - Continued watching Toradora with the Christmas Club, but I've hit the wall of "I don't have Crunchyroll Premium, so I need to find some other way to watch"

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!/Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions (1-6/12)** - Started Chuunibyou two nights ago, and I've fallen in love with this show. The comedy is great, and I love the character interactions between Rikka and Yuta, as well as [Slight spoilers](/s "Dekomori playing a constant comedic foil to Nibutani"). Really looking forward to the rest of this and the second season.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed Chuuni - yes, _both_ seasons - the characters and art were great. The story kinda got a bit unsteady in S2, but I enjoyed it anyway.

Rikka's antics are usually fun, and when they're overplayed Yuta is there to play the straight man. You could call it formulaic, but so is physics; last time I checked, physics still works.
>> ARTICLE
Hulu (if your on a PC) is prob the best alternative to turn to if you dont have CR premium that is legally.
>> ARTICLE
I made the mistake of watching Ookami-san as my 5th or 6th anime, so I didn't get any of the references. However, I did see the scene where they reference railgun, and that's actually why I ended up watching it, so I guess it worked out that way.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow I watched it without having seen any of the Raildex series, but I kinda knew some of the references anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Toradora is probably my favorite anime of all time. The only thing that gets close is Clannad. I just love everything about them. Then again, I'm kind of a sucker for romance anime to be fair. So I might be a bit bias. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Ookami-san too, it was pretty good, but it definitely had way more potential than it actually gave. So many little plot lines, characters, and subplots were glossed over that I assume the novel covered and there was so much it could've brought to the table that never happened. It's a shame because I really liked the characters and the dynamic that Ookami and Ryoshi had. It's almost 100% stuck in the *"deserves a second season, but isn't good/popular to get one category".*
>> ARTICLE
I agree wholeheartedly with this one, I so wish there would be a second season, but I don't imagine it'll get one.
>> ARTICLE
It also appears that the manga didn't cover the whole thing either...
>> ARTICLE
**Tokyo Ghoul (6/12)**

I have no problems with it so far but it's not *grabbing* me like Kill or Kill or Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann did. **7/10**
>> ARTICLE
I mean, those two set a pretty high bar in terms of grabbing your attention... But yeah, it never really pulled me in (perhaps slightly because of the somewhat clichd aspects of the overall story).
>> ARTICLE
I'm the same way as you. The last episode is what made the show for me. I wish I could say more, but I really liked the development of a certain character's personality. 
>> ARTICLE
You two should read the manga.

**Serial Experiments Lain (13/13)**

I actually didn't finished all on this week, it took me 23 days, but nevermind.

This series was awesome. It took me a while to finish it because I always wanted to watch it paying attention to it, like really, getting the details and all of that, because I have read a lot of times how hard of an anime could it be. And it is kinda of hard, I still have a good amount of unanswered question, but the main story gets explained pretty well if you pay attention. If you want a good mindfuck, go and watch this. **9/10**

Other than that, I've been watching **Clannad: AS (17/24)**, and the rewatchs of this sub **Toradora (10/25)**, **Kimi ni Todoke (9/25)**, **Suzumiya Haruhi (23/28)**. I will not comment on any of them till I finished them. 
>> ARTICLE
**Toradora! (25/25)** - I've never really given Romcoms a chance.  Finally decided to do the Christmas watch.  Gave up and binged the whole thing.  I enjoyed it much more than I thought I could enjoy a romcom.  The characters matched people I know in real life surprisingly well so maybe that helped in my enjoyment of it.  Though because of that Ami is definitely my favorite girl.  

**Steins;Gate (24/24)** - I had been putting it off for a while, finally got around to it.  The first 2-3 episodes were slow but after than... damn.  Definitely one of my top favorites of all time now.  

**Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania (OVA)**          
**Steins;Gate: Fuka Ryouiki no Dj vu (Movie)**



>> ARTICLE
Don't feel bad about binging Toradora. It was my second time watching it and my girlfriend's first, and she decided that we were gonna marathon it. For RomComs, it's quite good.

If you're interested in some others similar in feel to Toradora I can make a few good recommendations.
>> ARTICLE
I completed Spice and Wolf and really enjoyed it, I watched it because Holo came in second in that best girl contest so I figured why not.  I'm going to buy the light novels when I have the extra money to pick them up.
>> ARTICLE
**Railgun S, Toaru Majutsu no Index I, II, and Movie**  
I finished Railgun's first season a while ago and decided to binge watch the rest of the universe.  Overall it was pretty good.  The two shows have a very different feel from eachother.  Railgun is more character driven with more seriousness and drama.   Index is more cartoony with a greater emphasis on a larger story.   I think in Railgun each season only covered 2 or 3 arcs but in Index each season had more like 5 or 6 so the pacing was a lot quicker.  

I was really hoping that Index would do more to develop characters from Railgun but was disappointed at how little the characters from the series actually interacted with eachother.  Like Mikoto never encounters any Magicians and Uihara and Saten never see Touma.  Even though Accelerator has frequent appearances in Index II and the Movie Accelerator doesn't ever meetup with the other protagonists.  I get it that they all have their own mangas but what's the point of putting them in the same story if they don't ever meet?  The only real interaction we get to see at all is Mikoto acting as a cute tsundere in Touma's harem (oblivious to what's going on in the plot) and Kuroko being jealous of it.  Would it be too much to have Mikoto and Touma be in the same fight teaming up or something?  Ohh well.

Railgun 1 + S: 8/10  
Index I + II: 7/10  
Endymion Movie: 8/10
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna suggest that you check out the Light Novels for Index and check them out from the very beginning. A lot of the character development in the novels never made it through to the adaptation. For example, I found the Deep Blood arc of Index I to be fairly meh (despite the awesome ending) when I watched the anime. When I read the novels from the very beginning, I fell in love with the arc. I finally saw what the author was trying to do with that arc and what he was trying to do with Touma for that arc and it became one absolute of my favorites from the Old Testament Volumes of Index (alongside Volume 01). At the same time, when you actually read the novels you'll see a lot of the clever connections and little details laid out throughout the series that makes you appreciate how much work the author actually put into it. 


With regards to why they don't meet, it's mainly because each person is fighting in their own world. They do encounter each other multiple times throughout the series. Mikoto has encountered a few magicians (if you read the LN's) but due to the fact that her focus is on the lighter portions of Academy City, most of her encounters end with her dismissing the very existence of magic. Saten actually has met Touma a couple of times in the Railgun manga in the arc after the Sisters Arc. Accelerator does get fairly involved in the magic side though his exposure is fairly minimal but far more extensive than Mikoto's and to the point where he can actually understand how magic works, unlike Mikoto (although he can't cast it) and not to Touma's extent where he mired by the magic side...well, I feel that most of your issues will be answered if you read the novels in full rather than waiting for a season 3 that may never come. :P
>> ARTICLE
Check out the light novels, buddy. I guarantee you'll get everything you wanted to see.

**Durarara!!**
Watched the entire series and honestly loved all of it. The characters are awesome and I really enjoyed how the story was told. I'm so excited that a second season is coming out in the Spring!
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched any anime this week because of finals, so I'll just tell you guys to go watch *Gundam Unicorn* again because I can. 

Incidentally, today's my birthday, but I'm spending it at my desk studying for intro to materials science and a MATLAB final. This is it. This is my life now.
>> ARTICLE
Ah MATLAB...such a fantastic program. Just today I had a conversation about trying to find 2014b. Happy birthday and good luck. 
>> ARTICLE
It really is great, and even though I don't program often, it only took me about a day or two to learn the basic syntax. I'm planning to try to find an interesting project to try and learn more over break, although idk what yet.
>> ARTICLE
Happy birthday, Garlock. I hope your finals are going well.
>> ARTICLE
They are so far. 90% sure I aced my thermo final, although that last question about a heating pad on a conducting surface with convection threw me off for a solid 30 minutes (despite being worth only 10% of the points. Yes, I spent 25% of my time on a problem worth 10%.) ECE was also in the bag, I think. 

But I'm really scared about intro to materials science and dynamics - I got an 84, 100, and 84 on the first three dynamics tests, but a 65 on the 4th one because setting up equations for general plane motion make no sense to me. And MSE requires me to memorize a huge amount of concepts in a short period of time, which is literally my worst skill.
>> ARTICLE
So, I had exams for the past week, so I haven't done as much as I would like, but I still got through some.

**Psycho-Pass 20-22/22**

I personally didn't like the ending as much, but it was still enjoyable and I kinda liked that it [](/s " comes around full circle"). I was mainly trying to finish it off to get to S2 in time for the final episode, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen. I'm also a bit anxious to start it, because I've heard a lot of differing opinions on S2

**Space Dandy 8-13/13**

It was a nice little ride, felt like I was on acid while watching episode 8. I'm pretty sure I missed all the references (apparently there were some), so I probably didn't get as much as I could out of it.

**Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou Specials 1-6/6**

I fucking loved the show, and these specials just reminded me why. I actually completely forgot that these existed until I was just browsing MAL, so I gave them a spin. I especially like the special "Boys and Pranks"

**Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai. Specials 1-3/3**

I guess I just felt a need to finish it off and get closure, so I decided to get them out of the way. Since I had watched the anime a very long time ago, I was missing some information here and there, but it only detracted a small bit from the experience. Notably, I completely forgot [](/s "who that idol girl was"). The ending wasn't as bad as many people had made it out to be, but there were definitly some points where I couldn't comprehend the actions of *certain characters*

**Hyouka 11-13/24**

So, for some reason, I inexplicably started Hyouka, watched 8 episodes, then put it on-hold. I'm not quite sure why I did that, but I did. So this week, after finishing some other shows, I decided to pick it back up, and so far, I like it quite a bit. I'm not sure what threw me off in the beginning, but I'm really enjoying it now. I also enjoy looking at everybody's eyes.

>> ARTICLE
I might have to give Hyouka another look.  I dropped it after the first or second episode but have been seeing lots of praise for it on this sub.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I wasn't quite sure why people liked it so much at first, but once you spend a decent amount of time with the characters, it starts being a lot more enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy is one of the biggest hit-or-miss shows personally. I find episodes of that show fall into one of three categories: absolutely hilarious (like the zombie episode), batshit insane (like the plant episode), or the rarest one, genuinely touching (Episode 5 with the kid).
>> ARTICLE
> The ending wasn't as bad as many people had made it out to be, but there were definitly some points where I couldn't comprehend the actions of certain characters

Pretty sure it's not objectively bad (afaik, it's as *good* as S2). The only real problem are the character actions.
>> ARTICLE
I dont know what others think about the second season of Psycho Pass but I really like it. The first episodes weren't that convincing but now I cant wait for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
You've partially convinced me to give S2 a chance. I guess I'll try to catch up when exams are done -_-

Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica :) I fuckin' love it!

**Katanagatari (1-12)**

The first 11 episodes of Katanagatari were really good, but a little slow and sometimes seemed to drag on with 50 minute episodes, however, this was all worth it when the final episode came around. It was almost perfect and gave one of the most conclusive ends I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
**Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (18/24)**

I've seen a couple of gifs of this anime and specifically [this scene] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvAZ7e_fAw) was the one that intrigued me the most to watch the show. Loving it so far, although Yozora's generally bitch attitude towards Sena gets annoying sometimes since it happens so much. Still a great romcom if you haven't watched it already. ^^^Yozora ^^^^is ^^^^^best ^^^^^^girl.

Edit: Just finished watching [episode 23.] (/s "WHEN THE HELL DID THIS SERIES GET SO SERIOUS I WANT MY ROMCOM BACK ;~;")

Edit2: Watched all the episodes and [Spoilers] (/s "WHAT THE HELL YOU LEAVE US LIKE THAT?!?! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY")
>> ARTICLE
If you're liking that you should watch [OreImo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8769) as well.  It's by the same people and has a similar feel.
>> ARTICLE
Haganai is my favorite SoL harem. It's definitely a good watch, and both the subbed and dubbed version are very well done. The second season felt a little weaker to me, but was still solid.
>> ARTICLE
**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren (3/12)**  
Watched the first season some time ago, but felt like giving this a try. I know how people feel about it, but the show is still super cute. The antics and animation are still wonderful.
>> ARTICLE
never listen to other haters about shows, MAL have shows with shitty score than is better than one from the top 30
>> ARTICLE
I watched [Ano Natsu de Matteru](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=11433). It was pretty fun, all of the characters were likeable and had something special about them. Sadly Best Girl never wins :/

I really liked the idea of that one special summer and capturing it with a film was great execution of that theme imo. It also portrayed the season "summer" really well.

It kinda drags on and has some forced drama but resolves that fast and continues to build relations between the characters. The interactions were the best part of the series.

I rate 8/10.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the premise and the character interactions, but I agree with you in that it drags for a long time. However, the ending just felt too rushed and unbelievable.
>> ARTICLE
I watched [Tasogare Otome x Amnesia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12445/). I am a little conflicted on whether or not I like the series because I found the initial premise interesting, some episodes were fantastic, while others were...eh, and they botched the ending really badly because it could have been so much better. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm still on the fence about the ending. I liked the bittersweet nature of it, but then they kinda did a 180 on that for a happy one anyway.
>> ARTICLE
And that's what my problem with the ending was. I thought the 180 was stupid and that the other "possible" ending would have been much better.
>> ARTICLE
* **Manyuu Hikenchou (12/12)**   
Great ecchi anime. I'm surprised I didn't watch it earlier. It felt similar to Maken ki, plus it it was also made by a guy that draws hentai.

* **Pani poni dash (26/26)**   
I felt like I mished mos of the references to other shows. I also probably had a bad copy of it, because the pallette seemed distorted. Really liked thai mains voice, but other than that it was amediocre comedy show.

* **Kaibutsu Oujo (25/25)**   
It was really average in every aspect. I think it is quite overated on MAL. There wasn't even one aspect of it that was over 7/10.

* **Love get chuu (25/25)**   
It was fairly enjoyable. Very few anime deal with voice actors and this one did an ok job. Wasn't as good after the middle imo.

* **Sumomomo Momomo (24/24)**   
Really refreshing for something made in 2006. Momokos voice was awesome. Chibi momments were awesome too! Very enjoyable. It was also fairly loyal to the manga. Very good overall.

* **Joshi Kousei: Girls High (12/12)**   
Mediocre show. It had its momments but nothing more really. It was a nice way to kill 4 hours.

>> ARTICLE
**Kyousougiga (1-10)**

Very interesting show, and it's one of the most enjoyable that I've watched in a long time. I watched episode 0 first and was expecting some sort of FLCL, Kill la Kill craziness, but what I got was a well written and directed family drama. Well, for the most part anyway, as the first six episodes really drew me in. Those six episodes made me smile and care for the characters in a way that very few shows can. Also, it seemed like in every one of those six episodes, there was at least one moment that blew me away. That wow-factor is something that I had missed recently, and it can really push a good show into a great one.

The next three-ish episodes had less of an impact on me. There were times when it felt a bit too long-winded and talky, and I didn't find myself caring as much about what was going on as I did in the first half. I wouldn't say that the magic of the earlier episodes had worn off, but I definitely didn't enjoy the latter part as much as the first. The ending was solid though: it really brought the story, character conflicts, and themes together in a nice way, and I'm positive that I was smiling during most of the final episode.

Overall, it was a pretty damn good show. It had some great characters, themes that were relevant and pretty well explored, amazing direction and visuals, and well written, affective drama throughout most of the show. The premise and world were quite interesting as well. **8/10** would definitely watch again sometime.

Edit: I didn't even mention the soundtrack! Silly me, because it's absolutely FANTASTIC. It's very memorable and it seemed like every track added to the overall atmosphere of the show.
>> ARTICLE
**Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai (6/12)**

Had an interesting concept, but poorly executed. Yaya's a fun character, but most likely going to drop. 5/10

**Hanasaku Iroha (26/26)**

Really enjoyed this anime, even if P.A. works added a bit too much drama for a couple of the episodes. Overall really solid SoL, probably one of my favorite in the genre. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
**Eureka Seven** (1-2)

I just started Eureka Seven since it was put up on Netflix and so far I'm really enjoying it! Studio Bones is one that I usually know I'll get some entertainment out of so I'm definitely looking forward to getting into this show. 

**Noragami** (12)

I just finished Noragami on Netflix as well. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it. Nothing really new involved in the show although it did have some nice visuals. Its a good time killer but nothing to get sucked into. 7/10

>> ARTICLE
I thought Noragami had an interesting plotline but if it was done with more intensity and maturity it may have been something better.
>> ARTICLE
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on Eureka Seven!
>> ARTICLE
I really liked Eureka Seven. Just wait until you get to those bratty little kids though. They made me want to smack them so hard.

I have been binge watching Eureka seven, again(like fifth time), and I gotta say it has become my favorite anime, its just so amazing and it makes me get the feels man!

Also, after I'm finished watching it I think I'm going to watch E7:AO again, and see if it really is that much worse.

Ah, so you're on Water 7/Enies Lobby. Definitely one of the strongest set of arcs in the series, you will not be disappointed.

Unfortunately the pacing only gets slower as time goes on, but it only starts to get really bad a couple hundred episodes from where you are, so it's fine for now.
>> ARTICLE
**Bakemonogatari (13/15)**

I reached the point in this series where you realize there's way more potential content than 15 episodes can handle, so I grabbed Nise today and it's been bumped to the top of my queue. It's definitely justified the amount of space I've seen the characters take up on my dashboard.

Great show, can't wait to wrap up this season!

**Is the Order a Rabbit? (10/12)**

I have a lot of feelings about this show - like a lot of so-so shows I think it started out strong and then fell off, unfortunately that slump lasted for 6 episodes. For whatever reason the last couple have been really solid though, almost unjustifiably considering how weak the rest of the series has been.

Pretty cute and kind of funny, but not enough of either to recommend. Doomed to be forgotten among the loads of moe filler shows and remembered only for its banging OP song, ridiculous title, and a couple of cute characters that may live beyond the series itself.
>> ARTICLE
I finished Nise last night, right after Bake, and I ended up liking Nise a bit more. Bake is all about introducing the characters, and Nise focuses on Araragi's sisters while also giving some time to his "harem". Nise does have more fanservice though, so YMMV when you get to it depending on if you like that or not.

I started and finished Anohana. I cried so hard, and I wished I wasn't in a skype call with my friends when I was watching it

**Hanasaku Iroha (12/26)**

I became a fan of PA Works when they first aired Tari Tari (I did really like Canaan but didn't know that one was PA Works).  I really like this show, its (so far) one of my favorites from the studio.  I adore the more light-hearted setting and the color palette that PA Works emphasizes (a lot of oranges, reds and yellows, which is very warm and welcoming as opposed to the cooler tones they used in Nagi-Asu which was all blues and greys.)  It's a, while not necessarily slow, very deliberate but low-key series.  Ohana reminds me of Honoka from Love Live!, albeit less ditzy. **9/10**
>> ARTICLE
got though the first half of **Durarara!!** and loved it. The story was good and the characters are awesome. Shizuo might be my favorite, but Kida-kun is right up there with him. The world felt so awesome. the character's back stories is what really nailed the series as being one of my favorites. 

**Jojo's Bizarre Adventure** has been pretty good as well i think its story is really cool and i think Joseph is better than Jonathan b/c of his awesome as fuck personality. (also prob b/c that the VA of young Joseph is also the VA of Gintoki from Gintama) . The art style is interesting as well. The story is simple but get more interesting as the story goes on. Also like how in some of the eps the ED for it starts in a little bit before the actual ED and give its a more cool feel

watched **FMA Sacred Star of Milos** on toonami last night just to see how it was and its okay. I thought the story felt like a simplified story of Brotherhood story and all the new characters that were introduced were kinda annoying imo. 

Watched **Spirited Away** and i loved it. The characters and the feels were awesome. really hard describe how it was in words. All parts of the movie were so good that its hard to pinpoint one out.

Watching **Toradora** as part of the christmas rewatch (first time for me) and god damn its so cute, funny, serious, and silly all at once. i can see why its a reddit favorite
>> ARTICLE
Baccano!(8-16)- I loved the whole thing from start to finish. It is one of my favorite shows that I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
I wish there are more anime that takes cues from durarara and bacanno. Sometimes, different presentation style makes a show more engaging.

Trigun: 3-26
A great combo of badass, funny, and sad. I loved every second of it.

Just finished Kimi ni Todoke. The characters are dense and I watched it mostly to see if they'd get less dense [hint: ](/s "they did not"). Ryu and Chizu were cool, too though. Overall, don't really recommend unless that type of thing is up your alley.
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari** (12/12)

Nisio Isin writes great characters and dialogue.  The animation and artstyle is absolutely beautiful.  The ending is also extremely conclusive and fantastic.  One of my favourite shows now.

**To LOVE-RU** (26/26)

The mediocre art and the fact that it was only mastered in 480p bothers me quite a bit.  It was also probably a poor idea to marathon such an episodic series.  I like ecchi comedy regardless though so hopefully the subsequent seasons should be better.

**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** (11/12)

Really refreshing and hilarious even though it's a high school romcom.  It does a great job of satirizing shoujo manga and subverting shoujo tropes.
>> ARTICLE
I hope you keep watching To Love Ru, the other seasons were much much better than the first and Darkness ha actually somewhat of a story in it, other than the boobies.

I just added Katanagatari to my PTW list last night. I'd thought before that it was part of the Monogatari series with a funny name, but looked it up to be sure and it seemed interesting.

Holy fuck. I mean... holy fuck. Monster is outstanding, you guys weren't kidding around. It's good. Like, really really good. Four episodes in and I'm already really hooked. This is hands down the most maturely written anime I've ever come across, and it's very well written on top of that. I can't wait to see what else happens from here! I think my only complaint so far is that there's no German dub. I barely know any German, but it seems like a crime that there isn't one.

(And just out of curiosity, what do you guys think of the dub?)

**WataMote** (5/12)

I'm enjoying this series so far. Tomoko's antics are ridiculously entertaining. As someone who's dealt with Tomoko-level social anxiety all his life, seeing it put in a comedic light is strangely nice. The show's pretty fun, overall.

**Hetalia World Series** (24/48)

World Series is much better than Axis Powers in that it's much much funnier. Axis Powers had one good laugh every other episode, while World Series has had plenty of laughs almost every episode. The scene where Italy takes Japan for a drive had me busting a gut ("That's why Japan makes very safe cars... and now you know what Japanese people look like when they piss themselves!") Seriously, that narrator is amazing, I fuckin love her. Hetalia's the perfect casual anime, if you ask me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching the Monster dub at the moment and I think it's totally fine. I honestly think a dub fits this show better than subs. I can get into it more easily.

I'm on episode 44 and I can vouch that it stays amazing.
>> ARTICLE
From what I've seen of the dub, it looks pretty good. I recommend you check out a Japanese scene with Johan speaking though, because the voice captures a certain creepiness without sounding like it's trying too hard. Goosebumbps.
>> ARTICLE
First 30 minutes of Garzey's Wing-Watched it with friends. The dub was absolutely horrendous and the plot was terrible. Also I was sorta surprised to find that it was horribly boring as well. 

Finished Crest of the stars-  Really good show. Not perfect but a very solid space opera. I'm excited to see where it goes.

Shin Getter Robo vs. Neo Getter robo-Watched all 4 episodes. Fun little super robot anime. Definitely made for kids but it was still a fun watch with some great moments. Texas Jack and it's pilots were hilarious. 

First 3 episodes of Gundam:08th MS Team- Liking it so far but I don't quite get all the hype behind it as one of the best Gundam shows. I prefer the epic storytelling of Zeta and the original more to be honest. It's still a very cool wartime drama though. The whole thing so far reminds me of the Vietnam war with mechs for some reason.

Rewatched first 11 episodes of Toradora: Liking it quite a bit. I thought I would enjoy it a lot less on rewatch mostly because my tastes have changed so much bit it's still a good drama. I think I dropped Toradora at like episode 24 3 years ago so hopefully I can finish this time.

How do you even drop a show with one episode left to go?

**Bakemonogatari** - finished - 10/10 Easily one of my Top 3 anime

Fantastic animation and art. Interesting characters and very unusual way of presenting the story. Loved every second of it! Senjougahara is the best girl.

**Nisemonogatari** - finished - 8/10

Very similar to Bakemonogatari, but it lacked something. I think it wasn't as focused on the mystery side of story and focused on comedy a bit more. I can't pinpoint what was missing, but it didn't feel as perfect as Bakemonogatari.

**Nekomonogatari: Kuro** - finished - 8/10

Another great story from Monogatari series. What else is there to say? But again, it wasn't as perfect as Bakemonogatari. Also, this was the arch where I started actually quite like Hanekawa, which was nice.

**Monogatari Series: Second Season** - finished - 9/10

Definitely improvement on quality of some archs. Specifically Hanekawa Tiger and Hitagi End. Absolutely fantastic. I wasn't very fond of the others, but my enjoyment might have been affected by expecting Senjougahara to appear and she pretty much never did until the very last arch. This was also a reason I almost dropped this. It's almost uncanny how much I like her character and expecting/hoping she will appear and being let down every time for about 16 episodes was kinda hard.

**Spice and Wolf** - Watching [8/13]

This is another strong contender for one of my most favorite shows. I guess I subconsciously decided to watch only pure gold shows this Christmas (and so far, I'm succeeding). Firstly, I really like the setting and how it presents medieval times. I'm pretty sure I could write high school history papers based on this. Secondly, finally a story where main characters can hold hands and not turn red every time. I really love their relationship and I'm enjoying this immensely.

I can already see why is everyone hoping for Season 3. I'm will be joining you soon!


*So, that's it, sorry for long post. I got kinda addicted to Monogatari. Just a little.*

P.S. I should be studying.

> Nisemonogatari - finished - 8/10

I think that would be Senjougahara scenes.  What made Bakemonogatari for me was her character and she lost a lot of focus in Nisemonogatari.

**Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica episodes 2-12**

How people give this show a 10 amazes me. It had a decently written plot, but the character motivations are so weak and flimsy. It ruins any suspension of disbelief I had. Episode 10 was a very nicely written episode as most people tend to think, if only [Spoiler](/s "Homura wasn't sacrificing her life because some random girl was nice to her a few times. ") I did like Kyuubey's story, and the story of the [Spoiler](/s "Incubators") in general. I liked the ending, but I felt it [Spoiler](/s "should have ended badly, instead of a happy ending.") The visuals were great, and it has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard however.

Overall I'd give the show a 6 at most.
>> ARTICLE
Ugh.. I am on Episode 6 and this is actually really disappointing. You rate shows differently from me, but the score I would give this show at most if it becomes better is 8. I don't like the characters at all atm. This could change really, but I'm disappointed. At moments I find myself thinking about other anime. Like I am halfway through episode 6 and I am thinking "Oh my I can't wait to watch Gintama episode 34"
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't become better, in fact I think it becomes more illogical.

I finished it. I watched it all and I gave it a 9/10. Episode 10 made me go from 8 to 9. The movie is a 9 too. I see you are one of the rare people that actually don't like more complex and well written stories. :P

Usually I'm the biggest critique of character motivations but I would easily rank this series as one of my top 5. Which characters seemed to have inexplicable actions to you? 

[Spoiler](/s "Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure each loop was about the length of one month. We can infer from the number of loops that Homura actually spend a shit load of time, potentially years, with Madoka. Her obsession doesn't seem prevalent until some of the later loops, after repeat failures. Also, initially she didn't realize the risk of becoming a magical girl. This was found out several loops in.")
>> ARTICLE
Yep, Homura makes sense. Kyouko and Sayaka's relationship was pretty flimsy however.

Something I've been finding to be similar to Madoka Magica is WIXOSS. Have you seen any of it, and if so do you enjoy it more or less than Madoka? Do you think they're comparable series?

**Paprika** - I've always always loved psychological drama/horror/anything as a genre, so it's weird to say that I'd never seen *anything* Satoshi Kon had written or directed. I hadn't, until this week. 

I decided to start with Paprika since it's one of his most recent works, and I'm really glad I did... mostly because from what I can tell it's also one of his *weaker* works. 

It was enjoyable, but it didn't really have that unnerving feeling I'm getting from Paranoia Agent. From what I've read, his other movies have more of that 'feel'. Of course, there were some parts that *did* get to me... [](/s "The part where the giant doll pops up was creepy as hell!")

Its biggest strength was its OST. Every time any sort of song came on I felt blown away - seriously, it's **such** a good OST. I can't actually think of an OST I've preferred over Paprika's. 

The OST utilised a Vocaloid, and was the first film to do so, which makes it even more unique!

Overall, worth watching, amazing OST, beautiful art and colours, and an interesting, yet - in my opinion - slightly unorganised story. **8/10**

**Paranoia Agent - Episodes 4/13** - On the flipside I'm absolutely loving this! It's extremely intense and I can't wait to find out how everything ties together. 

The 'killer' is effectively unsettling, and yet again, it has a really cool OST. I particularly like the OP. The ED is also worth mentioning, not for its song but for its visuals... watching this and having no idea what's going on, the ED is *very* curious to me.

**Monster - Episodes 8/74 -** Oh man... I was so damn bored by this when I started it, thank fuck it's starting to pick up. 

Every episode ends on what is usually a cliffhanger, and no character can be trusted (something which is VERY fun to watch.) 

I was so worried, hearing how much of a masterpiece this is and then disliking it... but nope, I'm really enjoying it now. I just hope it keeps this up for the next 70+ episodes.

edit: Wow a lot of people are watching Monster atm. o. o
>> ARTICLE
> edit: Wow a lot of people are watching Monster atm. o. o

I think that's it's been mentioned quite a few times in passing recently. Heck, I'm currently re-watching it (again, again) because the little mentions here and there have made me remember just how good it is. Just finished episode 8 also. Easily the best anime I've watched - I just question how people think it had a slow start. It gripped me straight away and wouldn't let go for 74 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
> Its biggest strength was it's OST

I love [Susumu Hirasawa](http://myanimelist.net/people/5750/Hirasawa_Susumu), all of his soundtracks are fantastic.

Oh man that explains why I also like Paranoia Agent's OST so much too! :D But yes, he seems very fantastic. I'm looking forward to hearing more of his work in Millennium Actress.

**Deadman Wonderland (12/12)**
I liked the dark tone from this show with the deaths and dark stories from the characters
>> ARTICLE
Just curious, but did you feel this show ended well?  

I have neither watched it or read the manga, so I want to know before I tackle it.
>> ARTICLE
Ehh the story is kind of all over the place.  It starts off like a horror story but then in the middle it switches gears into a generic shounen complete with all the tropes you've seen before.  I liked the premise more than the execution.
>> ARTICLE
yeah it has a decent ending to a second season, this show is from 2011, so probably this show is not getting a second season
>> ARTICLE
I dont want to be the "read the manga, its better!" guy but honestly speaking it's really good. I usually dont read manga (I finished like 2 or 3 books) but this one is really awesome. The anime misses some characters I really liked, changed some parts of the story and is incomplete. I read the manga first so I was very disappointed but if you haven't, you will probably enjoy the anime more than I did.
>> ARTICLE
Pardon? If it doesn't have a second season and it has a decent ending to a second season, that means it doesn't have a conclusive ending, right? :P
>> ARTICLE
exactly, but still was enjoyable

Alright then. Got it.  

Thanks!

Finished Strike Witches 2 it was a pretty average show.

And I'm not necessarily watching this but I started the Fate/Stay Night visual novel

Absolutely stunning. Orderd the Mangas from Amazon, because I just couldn't wait for season 2.

**Toradora (11/25)** - Seeing the Toradora rewatch discussion threads convinced me to check out the show. I intend to finish it in the next couple of nights now that this school semester is over. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's see. This week I was taking part in the [Toradora](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!) rewatch, with it being my girlfriend's first time. She didn't want to do a daily watch so we ended up marathoning all of it. She's not a huge fan of anime, so it was nice to find something she liked. Might have to get her to watch Kokoro Connect and Angel Beats now.

Aside from that I knocked out [Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari) and [Nisemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11597/Nisemonogatari), which I'd been putting off watching. Starting [Monogatari Second Season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17074/Monogatari_Series:_Second_Season) tonight. 

I need a proper hobby...

Just finishing few of the most popular shows out of my plan to watch list:

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (64/64)**

For a 64 episode show I was suprised how well it was paced. I got really nothing bad to say about this one. 10/10

**Mahou Shoujo MadokaMagica (12/12)**

The hype was real but was a bit of a disappointment. Some of the artstyle I didn't like. Otherwise I liked it. 8/10

**Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch (25/25)**

I have been avoiding mecha anime but this one is definitely a gem. Too bad it had to end in such a cliffhanger. 9/10
>> ARTICLE
Get started on Code Geass R2! It is a little weird for the first couple of episodes, but then picks up, and gets really great later on.
>> ARTICLE
Working!! Season 1

I'm torn on this show because I feel like pretty much nothing happens, and the main relationship is moving pretty slowly, but i think its otherwise a pretty solid slice of life and I enjoyed watching it. The MC is above average and there's a couple cute girls.  I like most of the characters.   I think i'd give it a strong 6, or a light 7 out of 10.

Monogatari Second Season (Tsubasa Tiger Arc)

I might be in the minority here, but i think that Araragi carries this show.  When he is missing, or has a lighter focus, i think the arcs suffer.  I'd give this a 5/10, which is disappointing since I've liked most of Bake and Nise. 
>> ARTICLE
First 5 episodes of Milky Holmes.

It reminds me of Jewelpet: Kira Deco. I know they have the same director, but even some of the humour is pretty similar.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate and Code Geass. Watching Guilty crown now but its not living up to the expectations I have after watching the first two :( 
>> ARTICLE
**Gintama 88/201** So far I have loved this series, although I was bit hesitant at the beginning. I just love stupid silly humor and that's what this show is about! Although there is some serious, sad and emotional moments (I have cried more than once while watching this), you still have that feeling that everything will be alright. I can't recommend this enough.
>> ARTICLE
**Ghost in the Shell** - This movie really makes you think about stuff in the second half. I enjoyed the whole mystery about the Puppetmaster and look forward to watch the other movies, SAC, and Arise because so much is still unknown. I didn't know how well it would hold up after all these years, but the animation was really good, along with the dub.

**Aldnoah.Zero (3/12)**

It's like Micheal Bay made an anime, but I'm enjoying it so far.

**Welcome to the NHK (4/24)**

It's funny, it pokes a lot of fun at Otakus, and I'm waiting to see more dramatic things happen but for some reason hulu only has 4 episodes of it.

**Abenobashi Mahou Shoutengai**

I've been trying for a full day to figure out a way to describe this anime that doesn't involve the phrase "fucking weird". Unfortunately, I'm utterly failing in this task. With pokes and parodies of everything from ~~TTGL and~~ GaoGaiGar to campy USian television, from bishoujo games to... Well, there are times when I'm not exactly sure what the hell is being parodied, but two things were absolutely certain.

1.  It was fucking weird.  
2.  It was fucking hilarious.

And I really can't describe it any further. Not without spoilers. It's just one of those weird anime where anything and everything involved will be mentioned at least three times more throughout the show. It's complicated as all hell, but presented in a way that is fairly easy to figure out while your brain is being shocked repeatedly with cattle prods.

The closest thing I can think of to help me describe this would be a cross between FLCL and Kyousou Giga: it's a coming of age story with two kids that are just trying to figure out how to get back home. And, just like those two titles, it is exceptionally and exhaustingly weird.

Score: 7/10  
Recommendation Level: Yes. It doesn't matter what you say you like. The answer is yes.

**Usagi Drop**

Yup. I'm finally getting this one taken care of. Couldn't quite finish it last night, due to the occasional distraction from a very drunk birthday girl. But that's okay. Because Usagi Drop is all about family. Regardless of how they become part of your life, family is important.

Projected Score: 9/10  
Recommendation Level: Ask me after I stop crying.

**Nagasarete Airantou (1 - 15/26)**  
  
This is an enjoyable comedy about a young guy who runs away from home, and finds himself a castaway on an island inhabited solely by female humans and strange animals. Yes, it's a silly harem, but it's nowhere near as perverted as you might think, and there are plenty of heart-warming stories to keep you happy. The characters are all very enjoyable to watch, excellent voice acting, too.

Sword Art Online and FMA:B, both fully completed.

I finished **[Samurai Flamenco](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19365/Samurai_Flamenco)** on Monday. It falls into one of those shows I wish I watched while it was airing. I loved it! I even went through the discussion threads, though I was a little disappointed that few people were calling out all of these sweet tokusatsu references. The Flamenco Girls are my shit.

Right now I'm almost finished with **[GaoGaiGar](http://myanimelist.net/anime/890/Yuusha-Ou_GaoGaiGar)**. I'm on episode 37 where [](/s "ChoRyuJin is trapped in the asteroid belt"). It started a little slow at first, but picked up into the late 20's. J and Volfogg are just awesome.

**Spice and Wolf (4/13)**  
You know what? I like this show. The economics don't really grab my interest, but the art is impressive and the chemistry between Lawrence and Holo is great. Also Holo is amazing.

**He is My Master (2/12)**  
It's a show about a pair of teenage girls working as maids for a perverted rich kid, and the production is a collaboration between Gainax and Shaft. Buckle up guys.  
In all seriousness, this show hasn't done anything to impress me yet. It promises hilarious ecchi antics, but hasn't delivered much at all. I'm optimistic though.

**[Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) (164-170/201)** - My new favorite episode with a live action parody (episode 165) and Tama Quest! [More in the weekly thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2p6brt/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_164170/)

**[Kokoro Connect](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11887/Kokoro_Connect) (14-17/17)** - I mentioned [last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2oklrx/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cmo1d2j) that I didn't realize that there were four more episodes of the series until after I wrote up my initial thoughts. I had built up a lot of trinity symbolism when writing about the main series, and these last four episodes throw that out the window.

That's not a bad thing though since I liked the ending well enough. The fourth event of [final arc](/s "sharing inner thoughts was fun. Like the others it forced a lot more conflict that the characters would have otherwise let simmer, like the relationship triangle that formed with Inaba, Taichi, and Iori.") The issue I mentioned last week with a lack of substance was alleviated somewhat here and improved my opinion of the series as a whole. **Rating: 7/10**

Side note: I really like Inaba's voice. I don't pay much attention to voice actors most of the time but [Miyuki Sawashiro](http://myanimelist.net/people/99/Miyuki_Sawashiro) kinda stood out to me in this one. I had guessed that she was also behind Iwasawa from Angel Beats which I finished just prior to this series, but I had no idea she's also Seo from Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun and Yano from Kimi ni Todoke.

---
**[Kimi ni Todoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6045/Kimi_ni_Todoke) (4-10/25)** - Part of the Christmas viewing/discussion group. In general it's adorable. Slow, some misunderstandings here and there which I don't really enjoy as a form of conflict, but it's comforting overall. Also lots of bubbles and sparkles.

---
**[Toradora!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!) (3-9/25)** - Also for the Christmas group. I've seen it before but it's hard to resist watching more episodes at once. Had one of my favorite episodes at the pool this week. I'm pretty sure my rating of this one will go up after a second viewing and giving it more time to sink in.

---
**[Azumanga Daioh](http://myanimelist.net/anime/66/Azumanga_Daioh) (1-5/26)** - My roommate wanted to watch this on a whim and I decided to join in. The animation hasn't aged particularly well but it was kinda strange to begin with. It's very slow for a good part of each episode and quite weird as well. Haven't heard many people talk about it but it's a fun slice of life comedy if you're patient.
>> ARTICLE
**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun**

Asked in an IRC channel about recommendation for something to make me laugh. I read a little about Nozaki-kun and ended up marathon it from beginning to end. Gave me a good laugh several times in every episode. Animation was really good as well. 

9/10 will watch again next year

Highschool DxD, just finished episode 4 of the first season.

I'm writing a paper on the use of religious motifs in the show. It's very interesting how anime generally are very detailed in their research--sure, they completely conflate magic and religion and claim things that real life Christians don't believe at all, but they've never particularly cared about being accurate (see: Evangelion). Oddly enough, someone who wanted to learn about real life historical magical practice through fiction only would probably learn more from anime than from western media like Harry Potter.

**Ai Mai Mi (5/13 ep.)** 

An anime short (3 min/ep) following four girls in a manga club. I have no fucking idea what the fuck is going on but is is somewhat meh so far. I like that the animator pokes and makes fun of himself at the start of every episode. This is just pure slice-comedy. Not a very good one though.

**SAO Abridged (Youtube)** - I know this is not an actual show but it does deserve a mention. This was so hilarious, couldn't stop laughing the whole way through (They have only got up to Part 1 of Murder in the Safe Zone), with jokes poking fun at gaming, the characters themselves and over exaggerations of the plot. Douchebag Kirito is extremely funny and I can't rewatch the English dub of SAO Aincrad the same way again.

**Accel World (Dubbed)** *14-24/24 (Complete)* - This show is pretty poor compared to SAO (Even Fairy Dance). The near nudity of the young female characters is pretty creepy compared to Kill La Kill and No Game No Life where it is made funny. Even without using CLAMP art the animation on this show was pretty cheap compared to other Sunrise produced works. The Bang/Zoom dub for Viz was OK but not up the the quality of SAO. Rating 6/10

**Samurai Champloo (Dubbed)** *4-13/26* - This show is an episodic adventure about the adventures of a girl trying to find a samauri that smells of sunflowers and two samurai that accompany her after they burn down her families shop while fighting. The dub very well done for a show from 2004. This is a great episodic adventure series and I am enjoying it so far.

Bakemonogatari. On episode 11, I think. Beautiful show with some witty dialogue. Senjougahara is the best character so far.

Ok so I currently live in Japan on a naval base and have no idea whats playing in the states, I haven't even thought about anime in the last three years I've been here but all of the sudden I jumped into a marathon so:
Black lagoon
Gundam wing
Attack on Titan
Gurren laggan 

Literally have watched all this back to back in the last 2 weeks ( I'm on leave ) also sorry if these are playing in the states.
>> ARTICLE
Since finishing FMA:B last week, I've watched two whole episodes of Silver Spoon(Gin no Saji). Good shit
>> ARTICLE
**Devil is a Part Timer (finished)**

Enjoyed this a lot more than I had expected. It has some great character development for 13 episodes, and it has some legitimately funny writing in it. Came into it not expecting much, came out giving it a **9/10**.

Now I'm just sitting here hoping for a second season. 

**Another (finished)**

Meh. Gave this one a **5/10**. I liked the premise of it enough, and I did like most of the characters as well. My biggest problem with it is nothing seems to happen for so much of the show. It'd be fine, but I didn't really care about the world building they were going after.

I think I'd have liked it a bit better if they just leaned fully into the over-the-top death sequences, much like a final destination or something. That or if they had improved the pacing I'd have enjoyed it more.

3x3 Eyes! Hadn't watched it in around 15 years shortly after the second series came to VHS in Australia. I had actually spent the last 2 years trying to remember the title. Finally found it a few days ago. It is not particularly good but for me it provoked a sense of nostalgia.Edit; and Gunslinger Girls. It is a really enjoyable series but the second season has a noticeable drop in animation quality (change of studio)
>> ARTICLE
I watched **["Garzey's Wing"](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1657/Byston_Well_Monogatari:_Garzey_no_Tsubasa)**. The overall premise of this OVA series was actually quite neat and I don't really understand the hate towards it since I was personally able to extrapolate the main ideas behind everything despite it having a minimally explained plot.  

I also finished **["Sands of Destruction"](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4415/World_Destruction:_Sekai_Bokumetsu_no_Rokunin)** after putting it on hold for so many years. The final few episodes became much more plot-relevant and blew me away. In fact, this series in general has exceeded my expectations.

Kimi ni Todoke (12/25)

This show is really damn good so far
>> ARTICLE
I watched Guilty Crown, and I am so glad it ended after 12 fantastic episodes ( too bad it didn't have a second cour, right guys ? RIGHT ?). Animations were nice and the music was amazing, although the story was kinda meh. 
>> ARTICLE
Wait so did you watch the mythical second cour or not?
>> ARTICLE
Let's assume there was a mythical second cour, that was a huge let-down after all the promise the series showed. Let's assume it was bad, because the story was already finished after 12 episodes and the rest was one giant ass-pull. If there had been such a hypothetical second cour, I might have watched it. Thank god there wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Finished the Giant Robo OVA. I liked the Xmen-ish basic concept with some mechs thrown in, made up for really spectacular action. The plot felt pretty well executed in general, what with some pacing problems and it felt very incomplete at the end which left me with a bit of a bad taste. Artwise, the character designs hadn't aged particularly well but the animation was absolutely fantastic. Some of the fluidest I've seen with a huge attention to detail. Joy to look at. Soundtrack was pretty traditional orchestral stuff but very well done.Overall a rather fun hotblooded action show with a bunch of variety and badass characters. I think I rated it with a 7/10.
>> ARTICLE
**Monster 35-44** - Still great, not much else to report. I've been extremely busy the past few weeks and haven't had much time to watch this show. Thankfully I'm on break now so I'll probably finish the last 30 episodes this week.
>> ARTICLE
I watched 1-4 episodes today. I put it on hold. Does it get better?
>> ARTICLE
Episodes 1-8 are basically the prologue. The series changes a little bit after that but for the most part maintains the same atmosphere. I think it's worth continuing because the characters are so well written.

Finished up HxH, it was alright still don't see the fuss. Also watched Boku-H, started watching Captain Earth [(because hng)](http://i.imgur.com/OYzpmnQ.gif) and started Kobato.

I watched a bunch of obscure movies. Only were two were good enough to recommend to people. First was **Elemi**, a very strange film about an anthropomorphic electric pole. Was an oddly touching love story. Not a masterpiece, but well worth a watch. 

I also watched **Glass Rabbit**. It's a show in the same of vein as Barefoot Gen and other period pieces about WWII. Not as horribly gory as a lot of those shows, but still packs in a lot of emotion.

As for series, I watched **Planet of the Beast King**. First half of the show was pretty good, but the second half was awful. Would recommend skipping this show.
>> ARTICLE
Did someone say obscure movies? Because it's almost Christmas Week, and that's when I watch a metric crapton of obscure movies. So even if they aren't titles you would normally recommend, I'd still like to hear about them.

**Aldnoah Zero Part 1 (1-12/12)**    
Saw it at the end of my crunchyroll "updated" list and gave it a shot. Just finished ep.12 a few minutes ago and I'm really interested in where Part 2 takes this series. [ending spoilers](/s "But really that ending though, I'm not even sure how I'm feeling now; I guess this is what shock feels like? I'm worried that Part 2 will be hard to watch with how wacko Slaine became, but I have to see how the series ends.")

**Star Driver (25/25)**    
I enjoyed the start, but overall the series just feels undercooked to me.
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Persona 4: The Animation** (dub). I was kinda disappointed that the anime didn't show the true ending, but then I was told there was an OVA called **No One is Alone** that does that. Anyway, really cool anime for the most part. There are 2 things though that I felt could have been done better.

[Persona 4 spoiler](/s "1. I felt that they should have shown the bad ending of pushing Namatame into the TV, forward to March where the fog hasn't lifted, Nanako is still dead and Yu leaves. Then, go back to December and have Yu stop before pushing him into the TV, and you know the rest.")

[](/s "They actually did show a bad ending during the Mitsuo fight, but it felt weird, as those endings shouldn't happen until after Heaven. It felt like it wasn't the time for that, and the Mitsuo fight wasn't the place either.")

[](/s "2. The fight against Umeno-Sagiri was too short. They flushed out 3/4 of what made this fight interesting in the game, and IMO gave way too much time for Adachi's blabbering.")

I'm also watching **Kiniro Mosaic** at the moment. Why you ask? Well, [I'll let Kanji answer that.](https://40.media.tumblr.com/bc51b4c4036d497c97157e9b3b3a42ad/tumblr_mut2jfWNNv1skpr97o1_500.png)

Today I finished Neon Genesis Evangelion along with EoE as suggested by my friend. It was really awesome. It had a very deep plot. I did not care a whole bunch about Shinji because of his constant bitching but he still did his job. This was my 2nd mecha show after watching Knights of Sidonia a few months back which had a decent story but really weird (not in a good way) art style. The only other mecha show on my list to watch it Gurren Lagan but it might be too silly for me considering I try to find dark stories to watch. 

I would give Neon Genesis + EoE a solid 9/10.

Kimi ni Todoke:

I quickly fell in love with the startling differences that were present in character archetypes as compared to other animes in the 'shoujo' genre that I have seen.  Kuronuma was different and I really felt accomplished when seeing her progress as a character; something I feel that present day anime lacks.  There were some relatable parts in every episode, all in all if you're looking for a great romance anime and you haven't seen Kimi ni Todoke, please do yourself a favour and watch it.

Late to the show but I literally just finished **Kill La Kill**. I feel like I just got off a roller coaster and I already want more.

Magi. Saw it on netflix and finished both seasons in a week. Reading the manga now. I'm curious why this show's not more popular. I feel like it's good enough where it should be one of the most popular shounen manga-animes, but it doesnt get anywhere near the same level of exposure. Hopefully it gets a third season eventually when there's enough manga material and perhaps it'll make a hunter x hunter-like surge in popularity. Plus, with naruto now over and bleach ending eventually (pne piece probably wont ever end), we need some new shounen anime in the big 3!

I finished watching Elfen Lied just moments ago.

Jesus Tap-dancing Christ, that was a spectacular show!

I was trying to find something that I would care to watch after watching FMA and NGE, and Elfen Lied is pretty damn good. I don't wanna go into specifics because

1) Formatting a spoiler is hell on a mobile device, and

2) It's only 13 episodes long. If you haven't watched it yet, do so.

Now my problem is to find another worthwhile anime to watch.

**Hataraku Maou-sama! (The Devil is a Part-Timer!) (13/13)**

I started watching this after Arkada reviewed this on Glass Reflection, his anime review channel. I've been meaning to watch more comedic/light-hearted shows, so I thought I would watch this. Man, was I not disappointed. I absolutely adored and enjoyed the show. Particularly since I got to watch with the english dub, which is excellent in two ways. The voice-acting itself was excellent, but the script is where it really shined. A lot of funny pop culture references, I was laughing the whole way through. It wasn't perfect, but I really enjoyed the show. 

[Kinda spoilers, just my opinion about HOW to watch the show.](/s "One thing I may consider doing is watching it again in the japanese dub, if only because I will read the subtitles more closely. Having watched the series on Netflix, there was a weird quirk in that there is an option for Closed Captions as well as subtitles for the japanese audio, in that if you watch the English dub with the closed captions, you get the english dub, minus all the times that the characters speak in their special language from the show, which is really annoying because they will carry full conversations in the made up language. So it's better to watch with the "subtitles" on, but that is imperfect since the subs are for the japanese audio, and won't sync up with the english script. Granted, there were some nice jokes in the japanese audio that would be missed in the english audio, it is none the less frustrating because the subs don't match what's being said in english.")

**Kuroko no Basket/Kuroko's Basketball S1 (1-17/25)**

It's been recommended to me by lots of IRL people... I decided to finally watch it, after finishing Spice and Wolf (soooo goood!), and I wasn't disappointed. The story is pretty basic, but Kuroko's lack of presence really takes it for me. I loved how it was always a running gag, and even helped him in games! Kagami is also a pretty good character, IMO. He's basically what we'd imagine would be the protagonist, but isn't (well, he *is* sort of the MC, but it's Kuroko's name in the title, so I consider him as the MC).
I really liked it and after I finish it, I'll probably get around to watching another sports anime (Hajime no Ippo, maybe?). I give it a 9.3/10, so far!

Kanon(2006) (1-7/24)

Better then expected to be honest. I watched Clannad and After Story first and was expecting a similar story line to the first Clannad, but I feel that Kanon is actually better. Kanon's protagonist is one of the best male leads I've seen and the story progression really reminds me of the way After Story played out. All the comedic moments are well done without relying on tired tropes, and the English voice acting isn't too bad for this type of anime. Overall very solid so far and would recommend to people that have watched Clannad or want an introduction to Key animation.
>> ARTICLE
Well technically not this week since it's monday, but last week in the weekend i thought maybe i should see what all the fuss is about in hunter x hunter, i am hooked and currently at episode 30... But that fucking song, it was good in the start but now its just a bit annoying :P
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Kill La Kill.  I like it but I can only take 1 or 2 episodes of it at a time before I have to move on to something else.

I also watched all of Nagi no Asukara.  The overall feeling I was left with was that I really enjoyed it, but I strongly suspect that a lot of that is leftover feelings from the first cour, before the time skip.  Looking back on it the first cour was pretty obviously way WAY better than the second.

Also started Gingitsune, which I'm enjoying so far.  It's nothing special but for what it is it's pretty charming.

Why, yes, now that you mention it, all 3 of these are from the same season.  I got burned out on anime about a year ago and took a break, so now I'm going back and catching up.

Going to finish up Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (2012). 

The pacing IMO for the first part was pretty slow because of the introductions, setup for the storyline, and getting used to the unique visuals the series employs. But, once I started watching the second part of the season, the plot and the action began to pick up and I started to enjoy the humor and art style. I binged watched like 10 episodes in a row last night because I could not stop watching; I would have finished the last 2 episodes but I needed a good night's sleep. I plan to watch Stardust Crusaders and read the manga because the Jojo's Bizarre Adventures series is beginning to grow on me.

I went through To Aru Kagaku no Railgun last week, and have now started on S.

And now they've introduced [](/s "Misaka 9982... and gotten rid of her just as quickly")...

I finished watching Clannad Afterstory 2 days ago, it was amazing and sad :'(

I really did not find it that sad :I

I mean sure it was sad but i expected some super fist of feels hitting me right in the face every episode. Instead i was a bit aww. Maybe i am just a monster D:

But i found angelbeats sad. Hmm idk.
>> ARTICLE
The only part i found sad in [Angelbeats](/s "is at the end when Kanade and Yuzuru are alone, she thanks him, and then disapears.")  
But [Clannad](/s "so much sad moments after Nagisa's death. I cried a lot and took a short break after Ushio's death.")
>> ARTICLE
I didn't find angelbeats sad. I'm also a parent though so Afterstory hit me hard when he met with his grandma.
>> ARTICLE
Just started **Clannad**, so only on episode 3 of the first series. The sad thing is that I thought for *years* I had watched this show, only to find out recently that I had confused Kanon with Clannad. [I wonder how that happened?](http://imgur.com/a/Yuxj8). The only reason I figured it out was when I started listening to the recent ANNCast episode devoted to Clannad. Very quickly I realized that it was not the show I thought I had seen, so I decided to watch it (especially after having it on my MAL as watched for years). Oops.

I also am at episode 14 of **Psycho-Pass** season 1. Wow now I realize why people like this series so much. I would say my on complaint (so far) about it is some aspects of the show are way to "cutsey", the main example being the big headed drones, or whatever they're called. It just seems way to silly to fit in this world. The other, but far more minor example would be Akane's alarm/house AI thing... the jelly fish looking creature that I wanted to smother the second it opened its mouth. Other than that the show has been really amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
I assume that all the cutsey stuff is supposed to give that feeling. All the extreme stuff like that is designed to help keep people happy and calm, to prevent their psycho-pass from clouding in crappy situations. The drones usually have that cute appearance when they are interacting with the general public during a situation that would probably stress people out.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not apposed to the idea of cutsey drones, its just that they took it to such a huge bobble head extreme. It kind of reminded me of the Searchmaton's in Dennou Coil. Just very odd looking, not very comforting at all.

**One Outs  18/25**

Finally got around to watching this show after seeing rave reviews and recommendations about it, and frankly I'm rather disappointed. I don't regret picking it up, the MC is a bad ass and the baseball plays are realistic and interesting but I don't think it deserves praise as an amazing series. Besides the MC all the characters are extremely cliche and forgettable, the story doesn't really seem to be going anywhere and there is next to no real tension or character development. It all feels very static : How will our super genius invincible MC show everyone up next time? The animation and music aren't particularly special either, all in all I decently enjoyed watching it up until now but it's not something I would re watch or recommend.

**6/10** so far.

**Gintama** (9/201)

Well, I'm finally gonna tackle this beast. I've heard it doesn't get good until episode 25 or so, but dammit, I've been in love with it since episode 1. Seriously, this show is completely hilarious and awesome. It reminds me a lot of Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, only it's not quite as insane. I was worried about starting such a long show, but I think it's going to be a much quicker and easier watch than I thought.

**Monster** (46/74)

Man, I really need to put more time into watching this, I've been slacking on it like crazy. It's an amazing and addicting show, so I don't know what my deal is.
>> ARTICLE
> not quite as insane

Wait until you laugh so hard you broke into tears, and then it actually becomes real tears, you'd forgot what series you are actually in.


Stick with it, though as I would recommend it, don't rush it too much or you'll get burned out. The episodic and short arcs is meant to be taken as daily doses of fun. I think when you finally see the  "shape" of Gintama, you'll understand why people rated it so highly. Heck that "shape" ties back right to the first episode quite well I'd say.

**Steins;Gate** - Maaaate it was so good, honestly don't know if i'll enjoy another anime as much as I did with Steins;Gate.

**Psycho-Pass** - Didn't know anything about it but saw it recommended to me on Netflix. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.

**Fate/Zero** - Currently on episode 20, really enjoying it so far, i'm looking forward to see how things will play out in the final episodes.

**AoT Rewatch** - Got it on Blu Ray for xmas, currently on episode 14. AoT got me into anime after not watching any since Pokemon and Dragon ball as a kid. Regardless of what people say I think it's brilliant.

Shit compared to S1, but only because it set the bar so damn high it was near impossible to reach that level without Urobutcher leading the way. The first was a 10/10 for me, S2 though was an 8/10. It was good, just lacked a lot of what made S1 so amazing.

Not trying to circlejerk here, but I thought Psycho-Pass 2 was complete garbage. From what I've seen, most of this subreddit tends to agree.

[**Kara no Kyoukai 4: Garan no Dou \(1/1\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=4280)

Great continuation of the series, lots of character development for Shiki. Not really much to say plotwise, we can easily piece from the previous movies what is gonna happen, so the focus is exclusively on "how" rather than "what".

Rank 50 (8/10)

[**Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujun Rasen \(1/1\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4282/Kara_no_Kyoukai_5:_Mujun_Rasen)

The one with the most action by far. Also I believe this is the only movie where Touko fights (with the exception of one scene in [spoilers](/s "movie 4")). Plotwise its decent, its definitely more complex and harder to crack than your generic plot, but it does unravel nicely throughout the movie so I wouldn't say its too confusing. As for characters, there's your regular crew, so its awesome as always. There's also 2 major additions to the cast, being [huge spoilers](/s "Araya Souren"), the villain, and Enjou Tomoe. The villain is well written and Enjou, while seemingly a pointless raki clone, does get better throughout the movie and redeems himself. Fight scenes were abundant and well animated so that's a plus as well.

Rank 9 (10/10)

[**Kara no Kyoukai 6: Boukyaku Rokuon \(1/1\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5204/Kara_no_Kyoukai_6:_Boukyaku_Rokuon)

I'm gonna go with a common opinion here. This movie feels like filler. Yes its enjoyable, but this one has the least contribution to the overall plot, instead focusing on Azaka's relationship with Kokutou. Yeah they added some stuff of relevance with the villain at the end, but overall this one is for entertainment and not story.

Rank 53 (8/10)

[**Kara no Kyoukai 7: Satsujin Kousatsu \(Part 2\) (1/1)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=5205)

Best one. Inferior to the 5th movie in action, but it makes up for that with good development of the main characters. I'm gonna borrow some words here and say that the 7th movie is basically the culmination of all the character arcs, the final product so to speak. 

Rank 6 (10/10)

[**Kara no Kyoukai Remix: Gate of Seventh Heaven \(1/1\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=6624)

Overall an exceptional series that lived up to all my expectations. I really liked not only Shiki, but also Kokutou, Touko, and [](/s "Araya"). Non-chronological order wasn't nearly as confusing as I'd feared, so it does work for me at least.

[**Kara no Kyoukai: Epilogue \(1/1\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=6954)

Got a basic gist of this one, but there's definitely pieces flying over my head. I know that the [spoilers](/s "Shiki in this one is her body, or more specifically the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, but I didn't get too much of the existential stuff, as its not my specialty. Also I believe she hints that she is omnipotent?") I'd appreciate if someone can explain in greater detail, but overall its not that important.
>> ARTICLE
**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann**, a lot of hype -> expectations were really high. Kind of a let down for the first half but it got better after [TTGL Ep. 8](/s "Kamina dies"). The shounen humor just didn't click with me at all.

**Elfen Lied**, the 10th most watched on MAL. I found it comicly bad as in so bad it's good. A lot of wtf momets but I still managed to enjoy watching it... somehow.

No idea, but I doubt it.  The story is pretty terrible in itself, so I don't think it's a case of a great manga being poorly adapted.

**[Listen to Me, Girls. I am Your Father!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11179/Papa_no_Iukoto_wo_Kikinasai!) (1-12/12)**  
7/10. I don't see this mentioned a lot but it's been on my PTW for a while so I decided to watch it all. It's like the premise of Usagi Drop except it's a college kid adopting 3 girls, with a bit more drama and some romance. I had a soft spot for the oldest girl, [Sora](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/polls/1036000/1036905_1337913840851_full.jpg). It was nice to see not only the MC adapting to the new family situation, but also each girl dealing with it. Despite that it was sort of rushed at times and that I didn't care for some of the side characters, it was enjoyable and touching!

**[Children Who Chase Lost Voices](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9760/Hoshi_wo_Ou_Kodomo)**  
7/10. I believe I'd seen all of the other Makoto Shinkai works, so I finally watched this one. Extremely reminiscent of Castle in the Sky, my favorite anime movie. Like all Makoto Shinkai films, this one was really pretty, but ultimately I think I'd settle to call it a good movie. Nothing brilliant, but I'd say it's worth watching.

**[Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14741/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai!) (2-12/12)**  
8/10. This one surprised me, I loved watching it. Cute characters, a nice premise and a fulfilling end. I hear the second season isn't so great, that's a bummer.

**[Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) (1-4/26)**  
Doing the rewatch, liking it more than when I first watched it 4 years ago!

**[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex](http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex) (1-4/26)**  
Not really what I expected but it's cool!

I just finished season 2 of Chuunibyou last night. It's enjoyable enough, but it did feel like a let down after the great first season. There weren't really any surprises in the story, and everything felt very safe and same. By all means, it's worth a watch if you liked the first season. You get the same characters doing the same cute things but just don't expect too much more.

I just completed my rewatch of Mouretsu Pirates, 

http://myanimelist.net/anime/8917/Mouretsu_Pirates

Honestly really enjoyed this show... the music, the personalities... the animation..  Im a big space fan, so this hit all the right buttons with me.  This was the 3rd time watching it through for me, and it is just as great as the first time.

and next up on the anime-re-watch-athon is Trigun

**Ping Pong The Animation** 11/11 eps - 12/10 score

I had no idea what I was going into... This is a straight up masterpiece. Best character development I've seen in ages, the art style is fantastically refreshing and even the OP is great. This is the kind of show that comes around rarely and leaves a bittersweet taste at the end because you don't know how long it will be before you watch something quite like it.

**Mirai Nikki** 6/26 eps - tough to score atm... 8.5/10

So far its A LOT better than I expected. Haven't seen one boring episode - the pacing is relentless and the characters are awesome [spoiler](/s "12th was awesome, too bad he lasted only 1.5 episodes"). Great fun all in all.
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree about Ping Pong. I can't answer exactly when we'll see a show quite as great as it again, but you can probably expect it'll be whenever Yuasa's next work starts coming out. :P
>> ARTICLE
I finally stopped putting it off and watched K-On. Every time I saw a .gif I would think, "Man, that show seems perfect for me" and goddamn was it ever.  The characters were great, the music was great, and I never went 5 minutes without laughing - not like a short burst of air out my nose, like real belly laughs.  

Thank you to everyone that constantly posts about K-On.  I may have never found this show if not for this sub, and it's now up there as one of my favorites of all time.  

Even the girl I like the least is still awesome.  #Mio4lyfe
>> ARTICLE
**Kaiji** - In episode 4 of the second season.  I've really enjoyed this show so far, right down my alley in terms of mood and how brutal it is at times.  *Zawa Zawa*
>> ARTICLE
**Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Bladeworks** - I watched this immediately after finishing the UBW route in the visual novel.  It's not a perfect adaptation, but it's still probably top tier as far as VN adaptations go, and the fight choreography and visual effects absolutely make this a must watch even if you have read the VN.  Unlimited Budget Works indeed.  It is a shame, however, that they didn't take advantage of the source material's soundtrack.  I would have loved to hear rearranged versions of some of those songs, and frankly, the anime's soundtrack isn't as good.

I'll be watching **Fate/Zero** after I finish reading the Heaven's Feel route(Just have to finish day 16).
>> ARTICLE
It's been a year since I finished the VNs so please bear with me, but I heard from other readers with a more recent memory of it that the adaptation was pretty spot on, only the fight scenes were altered significantly, but that was a welcome change I think.

Agreed on the soundtracks.
>> ARTICLE
The inconsistencies are minor, and I don't think that they take away from the overall enjoyment of the show.  They certainly wouldn't keep me from recommending it to someone.  The biggest one I can think of off the top of my head is [UBW Spoilers, VN vs anime](/s "In the fight vs Berserker, Saber is able to take out one of Berserker's lives, yet Ilya still considers Archer to be the larger threat despite Archer not ever being able to scratch Berserker(in the VN, Berserker had to use his weapon to prevent being hurt by Archer's Caladbolg arrow;  in the anime, this isn't shown).")


>> ARTICLE
**Serial Experiments Lain** - Well that was a trip. I really enjoyed Lain's character and [Major Spoiler] (/s "watching her acend into godhood"). While I didn't understand everything that went on this is definitely something I will rewatch in the near future. 

**(9/10)**

**Slayers** - Overall I enjoyed the show. It's beginning episodes were good and it had a great ending, but I felt like the middle portion of the show was really slow. I'll be moving on to Slayers NEXT soon.

**(7/10)**

**Hunter x Hunter (47/148)** - Heaven's Arena arc was great. I always loved tournament arcs from old school shounen. [](/s "Hisoka vs Gon was one of the reasons I started watching the show in the first place"). 

The Yorknew arc is shaping up to be even better. I liked him before in the Exam arc but after [](/s "Kurapika vs Uvo") Kurapika is my favorite character in the show. 
>> ARTICLE
**Black Butler** 15/24

Holeyshit this is so good! The first time I gave it a try, it was actually the first episode of the second season on Netflix (they didn't list it as the second season so it was majorly confusing).

Black Butler is definitely a case of "DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER" type of anime. I haven't been so wrong to judge since Love Stage!! To be honest, at first, the whole Lolita, dark theme with butlers just sounds like a real turn off (although after this and The Wallflower, it really makes me reconsider).

Black Butler not only has a great plot but it is surprisingly funny! As much as I love Daisuke Ono's acting, this is also the first time I 100% prefer the *dub over the sub*. I actually had to purchase Funimation in order to continue watching it in dub... As someone with an American accent, I can't tell if they're doing a proper English/Indian accent but it is convincingly so! 
>> ARTICLE
rewatched a lttile bit of **Steins;Gate**: and man how did i miss out on those references to other time travel movies the first time. Rewatch is totally worth it

**Log Horizon**: This show has more politics in it than game aspects in it.It still really good though. I dont really know how to talk about it since most of it is politics.

**K-on!!**: finished this up earlier this week and love this show. It was  just so fun and happy. I still cant gett that opening quitar part of the Fuwa Fuwa Time out of my head.

**Tokyo Ghoul:** It so far seems really cool but the show has its lackluster parts from time to time. But the raw emotions are cool.

**Gintama**: Maybe if it snow enough Ill make myself a Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon as well. Love this show a lot . 

**Monogatari Second season**: Im enjoying this one as well b/c its not in Araragi's Viewpoint for once. Its interesting to see the other character opinions on things.

I finished **Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei** and it's good, I like most of the comedy in there, many likeable characters and godly OP, plus it's Shaft so I knew I'm gonna enjoy it. I also started **Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei** and it also has a really good OP, but the show itself is just a continuation.

I also finished **Ping Pong The Animation**, another one with good OP and ED, bunch of cool characters, the only problem is that the show sometimes looks really bad. It reminded me of **Chihayafuru** with it's focus on characters rather than the game itself.

Steins;Gate - Loved this series immensely, the concept was original and it was executed beautifully. I loved all of the characters as well.

The Devil is a Part-Timer! - Good change of pace and was pretty enjoyable.

Durarara!! - I really fell in love with this show. I really enjoyed the relationships between the characters and the concept was really immersive (teenagers as gang leaders, that's cool)

Psycho-Pass - Just started today and the neo-noire aspect is amazing. The music is great and there's plenty of bad-assness mixed in.

Not /u/slasher15987 but I just started watching Monogatari too. I just started the "Second Season" I think I'm on Episode 4 now. I saw you commented that you recently watched the Second Season too but this seemed like a better comment to reply to.

I started watching the show thinking it was just going to be about the characters and dialogue between the characters, but I've been really pleasantly surprised that there's more to it. I think the focus is still the characters and their interactions with each other but I like that there's almost always some interesting supernatural stuff going on.

You did watch Nise and Neko black right? Also I think you may be further into second season than I am. The closer I get to the end, the slower I want to watch it.

I did. I actually remember when I first heard about Monogatari I tried watching the second season because it was the only one I saw with Monogatari in the name. It makes a lot more sense now that I've watched Nise and Neko. 

I'm anxious to catch up to where everybody else is at. Not too anxious though, I'm enjoying taking my time watching it. I've watched a few episodes more than once to make sure I didn't miss anything.

**Tokyo Ghoul (12/12)**

Score : 8/10

Opinions : Really enjoyed this one. Only watched it because I wanted to know what was so bad about it and because I wanted to catch up to Root A. Turns out, people were exaggerating. I love the characters and I like the visuals. Anteiku Cafe now has a special place in my heart. I understand those who hated the ending without any information of a second season though. It was a bad part to end. Also, fuck the censors.

**Noragami (12/12)**

Score : 7/10

Opinions : Could've done more with it's world and had a lot of tonal changes which hurt the mood quite a bit. Also, Yukine a bitch.

**Hellsing Ultimate (4/10)**

Score : TBA

Opinions : I'm loving it so far. Alucard is badass as hell, the soundtrack is great and the animation is amazing. Only gripe I have is that Seras, so far, is a walking fanservice machine. Hopefully it doesn't stay that way.


>> ARTICLE
just wait till you get to episode 7 of hellsing ultimate. Its my favorite episode out of the series.  
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you on Noragami, I think a lot of my problems with it would be forgiven if they had a second season. My biggest problem is they set up a bunch of side characters without going through on any of them except for one that we met in like the episode before it. To fix the tonal problem I think they could have set aside Rabo for the future and just stick with the Yukine problem and the support characters they had already established. I mean Nora was fine, having her pop up time from time is a good reminder of who Yato is/was but Rabo wasn't necessary right now.
>> ARTICLE
I'd highly recommend you read the TG manga and it's sequel too, both the anime and the manga are good in their both right but I like the manga a little bit more.

Root A is really good as well so far, look forward to catching up!
>> ARTICLE
The problem with Noragami is that there were so few episodes you couldn't see the development of Yukine from winey bitch to total badass.  Second season when?

The steins gate movie. It was good but it really didn't need the movie

Exactly, it was good and I enjoyed it. But it was completely unnecessary.

**Mirai Nikki (26/26)**

I had to force myself to watch this because of how fucking infuriating I found the characters to be. I don't think I've ever hated a MC as much as a I hated Yukki. Almost every character basically seems to be bipolar with almost no sense of consistency and the plot, which started off okay turn to pretty much garbage for me. The only character I actually thought was okay was Akise Aru and thats only because he was basically a copy-paste of Kaworu from Evangelion. 

**Angel Beats (13/13)**

In complete contrast, I absolutely loved Angel Beats. I love the comedy and fun nature of the anime and when the feels came, they hit me like a truck. I did notice that there were some problems with the series such as some of the character relationships not making any sense as well as little to no development of some of the side characters, but that is definitely due to the short length of the series. Now I understand why people want a Angel Beats remake with 24~ish episodes because if it did it would definitely be amazing. This was a complete breath of fresh air for me after watching the cesspool that was Mirai Nikki.

>> ARTICLE
Since you liked Angel Beats, you should try giving [Haibane Renmei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei) a shot, it's really the same concept but executed properly with a very satisfying ending.

Finished my full rewatch of Madoka Magica + Rebellion yesterday. Third time seeing them both and first time from BD on a proper TV with good sound setup. It was pretty magical, Rebellion especially was just eyemeltingly beautiful. As familiar as I am with everything that goes down in these works, it was still the same ride as always, though I noticed [Rebellion](/s "my anger towards Homura having shifted towards pity, and the second half of the movie was more sad than shocking.")I probably like Rebellion even more now after this round, though the show will always be the best part of the series.

* [**Code Geass Season 2**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2904/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch_R2) - **Completed Re-Watch** - I've finished this re-watch of showing it to a friend. It truly is still one of my all time favorite series as I still got chills going through my spine as each development took place. I'm happy to complete this as it's my 9th time watching the entire series. 
>> ARTICLE
I rewatched it like 2 moths ago,  but my 2nd time. My gawd, it was even better, I payed more attention to the OST it's amazing,  and to other details, still my favorite.

D-Frag. Would definitely recommend to anybody who is looking for insane comedy.

[***Yozakura Quartet***](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4548/Yozakura_Quartet) (7/12)

I've seen [*Hana no Uta*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18497/Yozakura_Quartet:_Hana_no_Uta) (a year ago now) and, having recently watched *[Tsuki ni Naku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18499/Yozakura_Quartet:_Tsuki_ni_Naku),* was planning to watch [*Hoshi no Umi*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8457/Yozakura_Quartet:_Hoshi_no_Umi) before deciding maybe watching the original was a good idea. Well.

It's certainly different from the other series. I can't say I am enjoying it anywhere near as much (*Hana* was just too much fun!) I don't think it is a bad anime by any sort. Sitting at a 7/10 thus far (*Hana* is at an 8/10).

In terms of viewing order, I would suggest watching this series first, as it explains a lot the other series does not. Understandable, given the other series would have been made knowing this one exists.

***[Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26349/Danna_ga_Nani_wo_Itteiru_ka_Wakaranai_Ken)*** (12/13)

This is funny. Not as funny as I was expecting, but entertaining. And episode 12 was surprisingly heart-warming and relatable. I will be watching the upcoming sequel season. Currently sitting at 7/10.

[***Hotarubi no Mori e***](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10408/Hotarubi_no_Mori_e) (Movie)

Fantastic movie, extremely touching (think *[5 Centimeters Per Second.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter)*) 10/10

***[Mardock Scramble: The Third Exhaust](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=12053)*** (Movie)

Watched these three films over the past month or so, and well, they're pretty good. The world is compelling, the action scenes fantastic, and the characters intricate. A good choice for fans of the sci-fi and action genres. 8/10

Next week: Completing *YozaQuar*, *Danna ga Nani,* continuing *[Digimon Adventure](http://myanimelist.net/anime/552/Digimon_Adventure)* and I might start a few Ghibli films.

Witch Craft Works!

Came for the music, stayed for the adorable characters.

Story was kinda meh, though. Maybe the manga is better.

So I rewatched *The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya* last night against after finishing my first pset of the semester. I last watched it in June of...2013? Yeah, I remember it was during the summer right after I got active on reddit, and that I binge watched the dub performance (which is *phenomenal*) on Youtube. 

Anyway, it definitely held up in terms of quality. I realize a lot of people say that the *Haruhi* series had been a victim of the Seinfeld effect, but I don't think that diminishes the level of directorial skill involved in this movie (and I think it's *really* well directed.) I had watched bits of Haruhi 2009 before starting *Disappearance*, and the difference in tone and quality is *immense*. In particular, when [](/s "Kyon went to school for the first time after the world changed"), the atmosphere and the soundwork really complemented [](/s "the slow spiral into half-madness that gripped Kyon as he realized his world literally disappeared overnight.") I knew exactly what was going to happen, but that didn't stop the empathetic queaziness and rising panic I felt when [](/s "Kyon was going through it all. I still cringed as he shouted at Asakura, I still shook my head as he harassed Asahina, and that scene with Haruhi dismissing Kyon felt like just as much of a gutpunch as it must have been for him.") Similarly, I felt the same sense of [](/s "relief when Haruhi recognized "John Smith" and everything started to look up.") 

I've found nowadays that it get's hard to really feel what the characters in a show are feeling because of how poor the direction in anime is, so *Disappearance* managing to pull that off even on a rewatch is a testament to how well it portray Kyon and everyone around him. Honestly, coming out of this, I have no complaints; besides *Princess Mononoke*, this might be the second most perfect anime movie I've ever watched. I'm honestly not too concerned that Noizi Ito will ever really "finish" *Haruhi*, as I am perfectly content to let *Disappearance* act as the denouement for the franchise - a dramatic reveal of how Kyon really feels is a perfect way to end it all.

10/10

kyoukai no kanata - really cute and fun plot and ending need some work, super enjoyable tho 6/10

TWOGK first season 5/10 - it was ok not super fun the best arc was miss idol arc the rest was average

gekkan shoujo nozaki kun 7/10 - really good lacks something i cannot find some characters are boring or annoying but overall super fun to watch and nozaki + sakura was really cute

Oregairu 8/10 - Loved everything from this (almost ) Hachiman, 8man, was great and the girls where really cool too.. it reminded me a bit of hyouka but less serious more light comedy AND this show has the best imouto ever not some crappy loli/incest thing

Cowboy bebop 6 episodes - episode 6 was the worst anime episode i've ever seen put it on hold for now the episodes where always the same thing (same formula) got a bit boring but was still good i wish the episode 5? had some backstory for spike (wish it was a arc instead of a stand alone episode)

NGE - am not liking as much as people in the rewatch threads

>> ARTICLE
**SpaceDandy 2nd Season** (7/13)

Beautiful, funny, and addicting. I'm sure I would appreciate the show even more if I caught all the anime/cultural references.

**Gunbuster** (3/6)

The animation is dated, but the 80s vibe has a lot of charm. Plus, this was one of the main influences on NGE, so I have to watch it. I've heard great things about the last few episodes. Hopefully, I'll finish in the next day or two. 

**Bakemonogatari** (2/15)

Fan service + symbolism + walls of text. lol

**Neon Genesis: Evangelion** (rewatch, 4/26)

The only show I've scored a perfect 10, best anime I've ever seen. Stoked for this rewatch. 
>> ARTICLE
The last three episodes are when the show verges into masterpiece territory for Gunbuster. Have fun!
>> ARTICLE
**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (xx - 35)**

Really good so far. Not much else to say than really enjoyable.

**Kill la Kill (1-4)**

I started this yesterday, and man have I been missing out. This is shaping up to be such a great show.

**Bakemonogatari (4)**

I really can't watch more than one at a time. I think I like it? but its really hard to watch. It almost stresses me out while watching.

**Welcome to the NHK (1)**

I think I'm going to love this show. I can't completely relate to it, but i have been a shut-in, but not to his level. I dunno, I think I'm going to love it if it's going to be what I think it's going to be.


>> ARTICLE
I've been watching three shows recently. First is **TTGL**. I had started this before but just stopped for some reason before finishing it. I'm enjoying it a lot more this time around. I'm at the start of the third act I think. The tone change is taking a bit of getting used to. 

I also started **The Idolm@ster** and am having a blast. I wanted to give an idol show a go and had to choose between this of Love Live. Picked this one purely because of Chihaya's VA. It's a cute show and the songs are good. Overall very enjoyable. 

Lastly I started **SAO**. I've watched all of S1 and am on the Mother's Rosario arc in S2. I'm actually liking it. It's not as bad as people here like to make it out to be. The SAO arc was actually pretty good. Had the show ended at the end of that arc I would have given it a 7.5-8. The ALO arc was pretty awful to be fair. Rather than hating the show it was actually a bit disappointing as it had promise but ALO was a big mistake. GGO was pretty good overall. I liked Sinon and the action scenes were pretty good. I really liked how they finally dealt with the psychological effects of SAO. It was something that was just ignored in ALO arc. As it is now I'd probably give SAO as a whole a 6/10 at a big stretch. ALO is really dragging it down. If GGO had have been as bad the score would have been lower but it actually brought it back up a little. Hopefully the final arc will be good. I've heard good things about it. 
>> ARTICLE
Both Kill la Kill and Hanasaku Iroha. I have to say, it was odd going from one to the other!

**Hanasaku Iroha**: Completely random pick on crunchyroll, and I really enjoyed it. I thought Ohana was a great protagonist who did a lot to create a good atmosphere in the show, but the whole thing was really enjoyable - good cast overall and a nice setting. Animation was completely gorgeous. 8/10!

**Kill la Kill**: Another random pick, I knew absolutely nothing about it going in. I was laughing for the first five minutes and rarely stopped, found it hugely entertaining. I'm not normally one for fanservice, but didn't feel it was *too* gratuitous, and the ridiculously OTT action sequences definitely made up for it. 8.25/10!

I've got no idea what to watch next, any suggestions would be great.
>> ARTICLE
I recently marathoned Mushishi season 1. I really liked the setting, and how each episode tells a completely different story. I also finished Zetsuen no Tempest. I'm wondering why not many people mention it, because it was really good.
>> ARTICLE
**Spice and Wolf II (7-12/12)**

Overall loved Spice and Wolf to death. Really great show, thought the pacing for the second arc for Spice and Wolf II was a little bit off but still loved those moments between Lawrence and Holo.

**Tokyo Ghoul (12/12)**

I didn't know what I was expecting of this when I went, but I was pleasantly surprised. Kick-ass opening and good characters. I am glad there is already a second season airing because I don't know how I could sit on that ending.

**One Piece (43-74)**

I am trying to eventually catch up to One Piece. I really liked the rest of the "East Blue" arc. I felt like things slowed down after that, but it is not bad.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion(1-4/26)**

I am watching it with the rewatch group. Really enjoying it so far.

Just finished watching all of the Initial D series.

And you've now been listening to Eurobeat nonstop since. 

I've seen everything through the 4th stage. How do the 5th stage and Final stage compare?
>> ARTICLE
> And you've now been listening to Eurobeat nonstop since. 

Can confirm, it's too good. Can't stop.

I'd say 5th stage was just as good as the previous stages, though at times it got a bit bogged down in vehicular explanation but that was easily rectified by the fact that all of the Eurobeat tracks used in it were amazing. Final stage was a fantastic way end to the series as well, I really enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
5th stage was good but not great. The side storys suck. so much that i skipped them - that was the first time ever i skipped scenes while watching anime. Thats how much they suck.
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf season 2- (0-12/12)- I loved it and now understand the desire for a third season. So worth it.

Samurai Champloo- (1-9/26)- Also loving this. It's just...so good. So enjoyable. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching **Medaka Box (11/12)** lately. It's pretty cool. It's not very original, but it's just really fun to watch. The show went from small-scale [spoilers](/s "(lost dog, pool challenges, judo club)")  to large-scale [spoilers](/s "murders, riot shields, guns, explosions, destruction)") which is a shame, I liked it as it was simple and fun. 

It's trying to be much more and impressive than it actually is, is what it feels like right now. I'm finishing this season but then putting it aside for a while, since the overall feel of the show got much more shounen-y, if that's a proper way to say it. I'm not a 'yeah! explosions and fire and shouting characters!'-guy, so I was wondering if anyone who has seen the second season (Medaka Box: Abnormal) or read the manga can tell me if it does get better than this. I hated the [spoiler](/s "little guy with bouncy balls")-arc and I hope this isn't how the rest of the show is going to be. 

Like, as if what I really enjoyed; [spoilers](/s "taking the requests, friendship, exciting pool challenges and Medaka just being silly and funny") was just as an introduction of the 'real' story, which would be similiar to the last few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I have read the manga, and the rest is basically your typical battle shounen. Although it's a very good one with great characters (with the best one only showing up at the very end of season two), but yeah if you don't wanna watch a show with a bunch of fighting I can't help you there.
>> ARTICLE
Date A Live and Baka No Test, I had an urge to watch some stupid harems. The comedy in Baka No Test was great it had me laughing a lot. Date A Live was a bit to stupid for me and the character development was minimal. I ended up enjoying season 2 though, the show started to handle its plot and characters a bit better.
>> ARTICLE
Another just one anime:

* Black Bullet 1-13/13 | 8/10, though on second reflection this might be a 6 or 7 (I think I need to adjust the numbers I've got on MAL...). The animation was great and the art was pretty good (except the eyes). But I feel unsatisfied with a lot of the questions that went unanswered, both the ones voiced by the MC which went unanswered by the plot and the deeper ones voiced by his co-MC which went uninvestigated beyond a simple smile and brief wink from the MC... The plot also tasted of a half dozen other animes, including predominantly Evangelion. 
>> ARTICLE
Haven't really watched that much this week : (. College started up so I have less time.

**ZZ Gundam** 1-9: Liking it so far. Not as silly as I thought it would be and I'm quite enjoying it so far. Judau is a good MC but some of his friends are really little shits that will hopefully die eventually. It's very strange to see this after Zeta. It's the same ship as in Zeta but [Spoiler's Zeta Gundam](/s "fucking everyone is dead") except Fa and some minor character's. Occasionally I find myself thinking about it and just get all sad again.  There are also like no mobile suits on the Argama which is weird as hell. Mashymre is goofy af but I find him sortoff amusing. It really just goes to show how badly the Argama got hit at the end of Zeta. Anyways I think it's gonna be a great ride.

Keeping up with the **Evangelion** rewatch. This is gonna be my first time rewatching the show yet I call it my favorite. Looking forward to it. If it doesn't come across just as good as I remember it, it may lose it's top spot to Gunbuster however.
>> ARTICLE
ZZ hits episode 10 and then returns to the less goofy version of Gundam from previous series. Which, I would have been completely okay without episodes 2-9 myself...
>> ARTICLE
Yea they were sorta a waste of time. Isn't Moon-Moon supposed to be really bad too? I've heard it a few times before that it's even worth skipping.
>> ARTICLE
Moon-Moon was bad. And while ZZ greatly improves by about half way through, it never fully recovers from the silliness and never musters a Z-level plot. It's my least favorite UC series.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure I catch the reference there... but even if I did, the only noticeably "I wish this set of episodes hadn't been done" episodes were the first 10, from memory.
>> ARTICLE
**Kokoro Connect (10 out of 17 episodes)**

Oh God I fell in love. It's rare to find every single character in a show really lovable.
>> ARTICLE
**Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu/Gonna Be The Twin-Tail!!** (4-12/12) - As I've said in a lot of threads this week, **I**. **love**. **this**. **show**. I know there's a lot of varying opinions about it, but I thought it was amazing. The comedic timing was good and the characters played off each other very easily. The action was good when it needed to be. The concept, no matter how ridiculous it seemed at the start, turned into one of the show's greatest assets, as it took the ridiculousness and turned it into, imo, comedy gold. Whether or not it sounds like something you'd enjoy, I'd still recommend checking out a few episodes, and see if you change your mind like I did.

**Nisekoi: False Love (1-15/20)** - After a recommendation from a friend and seeing people talk about it on here, I had been thinking about watching Nisekoi for a couple months, but never got around to it. I finally decided to pick it up after I finished Twintails, and goddamn, am I happy I did. Normally, Rom-Coms don't hook me as well as other genres, but with Nisekoi, I was enjoying it from Episode 1 and I can't wait to finish it and for Season 2 to come.

^^Also, ^^since ^^people ^^will ^^probably ^^ask, ^^Chitoge ^^best ^^girl

Planning to finish Nisekoi in the next two days, then re-watch Selector Infected WIXOSS (As I recently picked up learning the TCG) and after that, decide between SAO 2 and A Certain Scientific Railgun
>> ARTICLE
Twintails was really marred by crappy animation which became unforgivable in episodes 9 and 10.  I'm hearing a lot of the issues are going to be fixed for the BD releases though so it's something to look forward to.

>> ARTICLE
Finished **Squid Girl S2** last week. They were entertaining but some of the gags started growing a little old. Liked the characters and for the most part there were a lot of laugh out loud moments. 6/10 (First season was a 7)

Finished **A Certain Magical Index S2**. It was about on par with S1, I enjoy some of the characters but just didn't really enjoy it. Index's personality is a constant annoyance and some of the plots just seem... contrived and too convenient. I'm just on the fence because I feel like there is a lot of great stuff there and it just doesn't come off as great as I'd hoped/wanted. 6/10 (First season was a 6, First season of Railgun a 7)

In the last 24 hours I started **A Certain Scientific Railgun S** and the first episode was fantastic. If only every episode was more like that. 

Also watched the first episode of **GTO**. I'm pretty excited because of how much it is loved by everyone. First episode was pretty solid, looking forward to the rest of it.

I plan to start **Glasslip** soon as well. I'm not sure why... I'll probably regret it.
>> ARTICLE
**Ben-To 1-12**

So I'm torn on this show. The premise is ridiculous and everything but the execution wasn't as ridiculous as I would have hoped. It was a fun diversion I suppose. The fight scenes were pretty well done and the music matched them very well. Sadly the final fight was extremely underwhelming. 6/10

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood 1-2**

I figured it was finally time to start this show. I'll admit, the first episode had me guessing if it even was the first episode. I know a lot of shows do the thing where they reel you in with a cool fight in the first episode but I still felt confused. Episode 2 was mainly information I knew already but that's fine. Overall I'm extremely hyped for this series.
>> ARTICLE
*Free!** (4-12) *Biceps and triceps and pecks, oh my!* 

Manservice aside, the story actually had more to it than I thought when I *dove* in, and it was a lot less gay than you guys had led me to think. All in all I thought it was pretty good, and I am anticipating starting season 2 next week, so this gets a 7/10. 

**Shingeki no Kyojin** (16-23) 

**FMA:B** (16-18) I am sorry, rewatch, for I have failed you. ;~; 
>> ARTICLE
Started watching **Watamote**. It's weird, a little sad, and so full of incredible embarrassing moments that I had to stop every five minutes to cringe and psych myself up for the inevitable humiliation the character was about to go through. And that was just for a couple of episodes. Levels of Empathy: Way Too Goddamned High. Kind of awesome art though.

Also rewatched a bunch of **Selector WIXOSS**, both **Infected** and **Spread**. I love that anime.
>> ARTICLE
Watched **Dirty Pair** (the TV series, not the OVAs yet). It was really funny and seemed way ahead of its time, and seemed ahead of some anime today even. I've been watching a lot of 80s/90s anime and they seem so much better than a lot of what's airing (content-wise, not animation-wise). I've started watching **Mekakucity Actors** again, such amazing animation! And I saw **Little Witch Academia**...it was so amazing! I want more. :D
>> ARTICLE
**Now and Then, Here and There** - It's probably the darkest anime I've watched in a while, if not ever and it really gets you thinking about the effects of War
>> ARTICLE
**Gintama**, its getting another season pretty soon so I thought I should catch up to it. No regrets.

**Nagi no Asukara** - loved the characters and story, wished there was more

**Amagi Brilliant Park** - just finished watching this like thirty minutes ago. great, loved it. it was fresh breath of air to me. didn't like the finale. wished there was more of it.

**Watamote + OVA** - this is my favorite comedy of all time. loved watching this series. wish there was more.

**Neon Genesis Evolution** - only watched the first episode, but i'll start catching up to where everyone else following the rewatch schedule is sometime later

after I watch the shows that just now aired, i'll watch some **Nisemonogatari**

**[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12029/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato_2199)**

It's officially my second-favorite reboot ever. The only one that did a better job at capturing the feel of the original series? Battlestar Galactica. 

Just as Galactica, Yamato 2199 had a lot of rewriting involved. Things were added, particularly the small craft and a greatly-expanded female cast, in order to bring the show more up-to-date and in line with cultural expectations. Yet Yamato did two things that Galactica wasn't quite able to do. First, it stuck with the same general script as the original. (Probably due to the traditionalists in Japan not being able to accept a Yamato story that didn't include the major plot points of the original.) Second, and for much the same reasons as the first, it kept an opening sequence that was [fairly close to the original.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgutpNRMgn4)

If you want to watch a classic anime redone right, there's no reason not to watch Yamato 2199. (And still better than Sailor Moon Crystal.)

Score: 9/10  
Recommendation Level: Just about everyone.

On-deck: Azumanga Diaoh

Watched all of **Madoka Magica** in two days. Found it to be quite brilliant and worth the hype. Planning on watching the 3rd movie soon.

Even though I'm far from watching all the "essential" anime, for some reason I'm filling my shounen quota with **Fairy Tail**, which is kinda of lame but I can't help but put on when going to bed.
>> ARTICLE
**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann** - Just awesome, very over-the-top, not taking itself too seriously, but not without its more serious and deeper side.

**Katanagatari** Weird pacing and the ending might not be the easiest to understand right away, but well written with good soundtrack and beautiful animation style.

**Dead Leaves** Shortest anime Ive ever watched (52 minutes!).  Dont know what to say other than WTF? I dont mean that in a bad way at all, was a lot of fun.

***Saint Seiya Omega***

Well goddamn if I don't feel infinitely more shnen after watching this series. I started it a few months ago but [Supoira Arto](/s "after Aria dies") I kind of dropped it. I picked it up again Friday and just finished it today. And I can say, of all the updates, rehashes &c. of older series this has been the only one I've truly enjoyed, it was a fun ride watching the heroes burn their cosmo to overcome insurmountable challenges. Also, Yuna's totally the real main character.

Sengoku Basara (24/24) + Movie:

So much action. The story follows warring clans/tribes from the Sengoku period and the fighting and plotting is awesome. The vibe reminds me of TTGL, SO. FUCKING. MANLY. [And that opening.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jugi1GviRfI)

**Hyouka (22/22)**

It's a chill anime with some drama sprinkled on top which I really enjoyed watching. Character development is nice and the story's quite good.

**Nisekoi (22/22)**

I've read the manga around 3 or 4 times already and I've decided to give the anime a shot to see how SHAFT will adapt it. I don't know why but this anime always makes me laugh even though I've read the manga a lot especially the chapters covered in the anime maybe it's seeing the weird reaction faces the characters make being animated. As an adaption this is really good it kinda sucks that they didn't adapt some of the Tsugumi chapters but I can live with that. Oh and Hanazawa Kana as Onodera is just too good and adorable the other voices are good too but she just stood out for me. It makes me question my rankings for the girls that I like. Overall I'm enjoying what they did with the adaptation and can't wait to see what they're going to do for the second season.

Let's see. In the last week, I've finished Abenobashi, Garden of Words, K-On! (First season), Devil is a Part Timer, Patema Inverted, and SNAFU. I started and dropped SYD after getting bored with it, and I've just started Yamato 2199. I haven't seen this much anime in quite a while.

**Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (1-12)**

So far I feel this is rather overrated. Story seems to reset after every 4-5 episodes and I am just being left confused over what the hell is really going on.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion (1-5)**

Tagging along for the re-watch. I last saw this series almost 10 years ago back when i was 12/13 so I'm definitely picking up on a lot of things I missed as a kid.

**Blade of the Immortal (1-5)**

Not what I was expecting...it seems to be getting better from the past couple episodes I watched though.

**Blood+ (46-50)**

Finally finished this after dragging it out and forcing myself to commit to it. The story moved way to slow and I feel this series could have shaved around 15 episodes and nothing would have been missed. Ending was pretty anti climatic if you ask me also.

**Sakigake!! Cromartie Koukou (7-12)**

Just watching episodes here and there. For those who don't know this series focuses on an average guy who attends a high school full of delinquents. There is no major plot and its just a bunch of funny, wacky moments.

**No Game No Life (1/12)**

Seems pretty interesting form the first episode. The art is beautiful but I feel they are over using pink/purple.

**Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow**

2nd movie in the Gundam trilogy. Step up from the first IMO and the ending leaves you wanting more.

**Mobile Suit Gundam III: Encounters in Space**
Final movie in the Gundam trilogy. Definitely the best of the 3 of them. 

**Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam (1-3)**

Continuing the Gundam re-watch with the /r/anime boys. Big improvement on the art/animation in this new series. Not a big fan of the new MC, Kamille at all but we will see how it goes.

P.S: I don't watch currently airing shows so it may seem like I watch a lot :)

I never watch anime as its airing so this is mostly the same as the other watcing thread.

A Certain Magical index (Rewatch since i got the bluray) - One of my first favorites, been watching an episode every night or two.

Idolmaster - Iori best idol

Fate/stay Night (Not the new one) - Fate Zero was pretty boring, F/SN has been much better, especially since my first Fate was Prisma Illya. Though Zero is a prequel I guess you have to watch F/SN to understand it.

Fate/Prisma Illya (Rewatch s1 and started 2wei) - Read the mangas, and actually like the anime better. Cant wait to watch the next episode, or maybe the last 4 later.

Kill la Kill (3rd rewatch) - When i need a break from Arrow on Netflix

Strike Witches - Found at FYE for $15 on bluray/dvd pack season 1 and season 2. Thought why not, looks cute. I fear i may now be a pedophile.

Spice and wolf (Just finished last night) - 12/10 i now understand why every other comment on this sub asks when Spice and Wolf s3 will be made.

Edit: Missed a word

Watched quite a lot of stuff this week.

**Psycho-Pass 2** (8-11/11)

Very disappointing. As a huge fan of the first season this one did not gel with me at all. Hopefully the movie will be better

**The Tatami Galaxy** (8-11/11)

Now this was brilliant. I loved the ending and the message it gave. 

**Kara no Kyoukai movie 6**

It was ok, nowhere near the same level as Paradox Spiral.

**Hunter x Hunter (2011)** (144-148/148) 

Beautiful. It's only a shame you can clearly tell the story isn't over, but I respect Madhouse for staying true to the manga.

**Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya** (5-10/10), and **Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya 2wei!** (1-10)

I had way, *way* more fun with this series than I ever expected to. Can't wait for summer.

I also started watching:

**Love Lab** (1-3/13)

First episode was so funny I was actually in tears by the end of it. I really like the art and animation as well.

**Minami-ke** (1-2/13)

This one's strange, I cant for the life of me remember when or why I put it in my to-watch list. Regardless, I gave it a go, and its alright so far.

**Non Non Biyori** (1/12)

Nyanpasu. I've only seen one episode so I can't really say much, other than that the at is absolutely gorgeous.





>> ARTICLE
Love lab is awesome ! I think the same people made Yuruyuri which also pretty fun.
>> ARTICLE
Seitokai Yakuindomo, currently on episode 4 of the second season. The review I read about it called it "dick jokes" the anime, a combo of the best things in life? I would recommend this anime to anyone who wants some dirty humor in an anime.
>> ARTICLE
**OreGairu**: 6-12 (completed)

Pretty good slice of life. Hachiman annoyed me sometimes, but I liked him still. The best part without question was 8man being in love with (and slightly conflicted about it) Saika. If season 2 gives Hiki any sort of romantic conclusion, I don't think I'll be happy unless its with Saika. Still need to watch the OVA. Yui best girl.

*7.5/10*

**Uchouten Kazkoku**: 4-6

Finally got back to this. Yasaburo is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters in any anime. Benten is really interesting, you can never tell what she's thinking, but as of episode 6 it seems there's a lot more going on in her mind than wondering which tanuki to eat next. Seems like with the next episodes we might be going into the political side of things, with Yaichiro and his uncle both running for nise-emon.

I marathoned Highschool DxD.    
It started as a "just for lulz" thing.    
I honestly enjoyed it.            
Not just for the tits.      
But there was just something there, you know?    
Kinda wished it was more serious though.     
>> ARTICLE
The story gets both more serious and more silly in the sequels.

Like, the story really comes out of its shell to become something genuinely interesting, but at the same time the power ups get all the more ridiculous which is a bummer.
>> ARTICLE
I'm personally looking forward to season 3.      
Though, with the lack of tension between the factions I don't know what to expect from it.      
Except tits.     
There will always be tits.    
>> ARTICLE
A whole lot more of oppai.

It's more interesting and adds character development, but the fights get sillier. I'd recommend not expecting anything though :p it's the best way to watch anime.
>> ARTICLE
SAO 1st cour. I don't think it deserves all the hate it gets, although the writing is definitely sub-par.

Hellsing Ultimate. Got to ep 6 and couldn't finish. It just didn't click for me.
>> ARTICLE
People complain from ep 14, most people liked 1-14, then hated 15 -25, then thought that sao 2 1st arc was meh, but a bit stupid, and a lot of people liked mother's rosario arc, it was great, IMO i enjoyed SAO, most of it, because i didn't have high expectations of it as most peole did, just don't think it will be another code geass tier anime, and just enjoy it, yes, some parts are meh, but others are WOW!
>> ARTICLE
Ben-To  
THAT WAS AWESOME! Rushed and anticlimactic but still awesome! As someone who lived in a dormitory, I could rlate to this show so much: The fight for food and saving money takes up mre of your time than studying! Though we didn't give each other nicknames and there were a lot less girls :/.  
Anyways, the OP and ED are decent, but the battle theme is phenomenal, it almost gets you hyped as much as Mortal Kombat's theme! The characters are lovable and hilarious(what would this show be without Oshirio?)though the fanservice sometimes went full retard,Burnette was plain offensive even for a light hearted ecchi IMO  
7/10 "That's fappable. Totally fappable. Do want."

I just watched the first episode of Aldnoah Zero this morning.  Great show so far, but please no spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
**K-On!** & **Clannad**. Definitely different from my usual animes, but I adore K-On and am liking Clannad so far.
>> ARTICLE
Started:

**Bartender** (2/11): Really interesting so far. Something complete different what I am used to watch.

Score so far: 8-9

**Neon Genesis Evangelion** (20/26): Started with the rewatch group but couldn't stop and yeaaah watched "a little" bit more. Really great so far. I went in without expecting anything and so far I like it.

Score so far: 8-9


Finished:

**Berserk**: Really great anime, unfortunately[](/s "it was way shorter than the Manga and the ending was a little bit off") . Still a great anime.

Score: [](/s "Despite the random ending") a solid 9

**K-On!**: Went in expecting an actual anime about/with tons of music. Got tea and cake instead and was not disappointed.

Score: 8

**FMA:B** Finished the last 4 episodes the other days (also started with the rewatch group :S). Was a really great anime. 

Score: 10

Are you watching *Eva* for the first time? I started watching *Toradora!* with the Christmas Club and ended up getting ahead of them myself :P
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, first time watching Eva.

Hm, I think I should watch in the near future Toradora! too. Have it way to long on my PTW already...
>> ARTICLE
Yup, my PTW's constantly full too, I keep getting distracted by whatever's airing! I watched *Eva* last month for the first time (it finally got me out of my marathonning slump \o/ yay for being able to watch fifteen eps in a day again!) and it was really quite incredible. Can't wait for *3.0+1.0* to come out.
>> ARTICLE
**Natsume Yuujinchou** I'm loving it, the only word I can think of to describe it is beautiful. The main character Natsume is great and relatable, and his relationship with Nyanko is one of the best I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
**Bakuman**, the first 16 episodes. Its been nice but i feel like the romance is going to frustrate me
>> ARTICLE
I just started Oreimo this past week. It's no Toradora, but it may just take second place for RomCom.

**Kyoukai no Kanata (3/12)**
Alright, despite a lot of love from the community, I did not really find this show enjoyable :/ I thought it had a great premise and stunning artwork (as expected of KyoAni), but its *execution* was very lacking. The characters have great unique character designs but the writing hasn't shaped any emotional connections between me and the characters. This leaves me with somewhat of an apathy towards what is happening on screen. The premise also fails to deliver due to the writing because I think the plot could be so much bigger or deeper than what it actually is. Don't get me wrong, I don't think this show is the worst that anime has to offer, but it was far from what my expectations had assumed (something that was a mistake on my part). However, in total i think the bland characters, and shallow plot leaves the show as wasted potential. **Dropped**.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (17-19/64)**
I'm still slowing pushing through FMAB and still really enjoying it. I am loving the darker tone that the plot is taking on. Episode 19 has been my favorite thus far, with the story advancing much quicker than it ever has before. I think the characters are developing nicely and the overarching narrative of [spoilers](/s "the corruption within the military") is much more interesting than the episodic world building of the first few episodes. Overall, still around an **(8/10)** from me.

**Howl's Moving Castle (1/1)**
My first rewatch of my favorite anime movie. Just as good as I remembered it to be. The art is unbelievably beautiful and the animation is simply pristine. But even more than that, the characters are also great. This movie undoubtedly reminds me of Spirited Away with its adventurous open-world and plot. I really liked the steampunk setting and a romance story from StudioGhibli only heightened my enjoyment. My first time watching, I did think that the plot was a bit scattered, but after my second watch, while I do think the plot could use a little tightening, I now understand a lot more of the very subtle character interactions and plot points. What I like about Howl's Moving Castle is that it appeals to kids, but there is also a very subtle symbolic undertone to it as well, something which I plan to try to analyze upon further rewatches. In total **(10/10)**
>> ARTICLE
**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Naonha** (12/13): Dang it's going quite slow now. The rewatching, not the anime.

>> ARTICLE
I just started watching Beck last night (finished the first episode) after putting it off for a long time.  I'm a sucker for coming of age stories, so I have a feeling this series will be right up my alley.  Also, I'm loving how "real" the setting is - so many anime have such idealistic scenery of city-life, and their color palettes are so clean.  I like that Beck isn't afraid to depict some "grungy" aspects of urban sprawl.
>> ARTICLE
Finally got around to starting The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Been putting off watching it for some time and didn't get around to it for the holiday rewatch. So far I'm enjoying it, as expected, but I'm 4 episodes into the time loop arc and it's really starting to get annoying watching the same scenes and lines over and over with minor differences.

**[Haikyuu!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu!!) (25/25)**

Recommended by a friend, absolutely loved this show. Enjoyable comedy and some really intense matches. Can't wait for season 2.

**[Mikakunin de Shinkoukei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20541/Mikakunin_de_Shinkoukei) (12/12)**

Kinda wish it was longer, but felt it ended on an interesting note. If there ever is a season 2, I'd like to see the romance evolve a bit more. Mashiro's my favorite character of the bunch.

**[Tonari no Seki-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18139/Tonari_no_Seki-kun) (21/21)**

21 episodes of a schoolboy playing with some kind of toy while his female classmate desperately tries to pay attention and study, but really can't bring herself to look away. Fun little series of 7-minute shorts I found while browsing Crunchyroll. Yokoi's commentary throughout the whole thing really make the show what it is and make these simple games something a lot more serious. At least to her.

**[Kuroko no Basket S1](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11771/Kuroko_no_Basket) (8/25)**

Haikyuu made me want to watch more sports anime. Although not as realistic as Haikyuu with its introduction of special basketball abilities, it's still pretty enjoyable. Can't wait to see what happens next and get caught up enough to enjoy S3 with everyone.

Index, just finished the sisters arc, but since I've seen railgun already it was meh, still I think it will get better, planning on watching darker than black after I finish index, what shows this season are good?
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching Hajime no Ippo, for a show that's ranked 17th on MAL I'm disappointed but for a Shounen it's all right. I've watched 28/75 so far.
>> ARTICLE
I may have watched a lot this week.

**[Beast Player Erin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5420/Kemono_no_Souja_Erin) - 50/50** - Fantastic show.  Art looks childish which tricks the viewer into thinking it will be childish.  Early on it kind of is because the Erin is only 10 but as she gets older (a couple time skips) we get more and more involved in the affairs of the country.  We meet a cast of characters that end up playing important roles in the country and/or Erin's life.  
Erin herself is a curious little girl with a knack for disobeying people.  She's extremely smart and picks up on subtle hints as to the condition of the Beasts her mother takes care of in their village.  
Music is also fantastic and they use it very well throughout the series.  Art style is one that has a base style but switches to other types in certain intense moments.

**[The Ambition of Oda Nobuna](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=11933) - 12/12** - Ecchi Harem.  One of the many shows depicting the life of Oda Nobunaga, only this time most of the major players are replaced with young girls ranging from the loli of the loliest to cowtits and jiggling armor.  Oh, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi is replaced with an MC-kun from the future who knows the history thanks to the game *Nobunaga's Ambition*.  Actually a pretty good MC.  Oda Nobuna btw is a genderbent Edward Elric.  Overall the show looks pretty good but the story and ecchi elements made it mediocre for me.  Must watch for any lolicons.

**[Mononoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=2246) - 12/12** - So Oshino from Monogatari is actually immortal and back in feudal times he met Ginko from Mushishi and liked his box so he made one for himself.  He found a sword that slays mononoke and went around doing his thing with that. (Uso da, Oshino and the MC have the same voice actor and occupy similar occupations so I thought I'd throw that in).  Art styles don't get much more unique than this, and it looks fantastic.  Very artsy with fast transitions and other elements.  It's split into 3 two episode arcs and 2 three episode arcs.  It's labeled as horror but it's not jump horror, more psychological uneasiness.  I thought it was great, would recommend.

**[Majong Legend Akagi](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=658) - 7/26** - I'm reminded of the tension I felt during Death Note and the Chimera Ant Arc of HxH.  Character designs are...unique, but the show is pretty good so far.  It's about to timeskip but so far Akagi makes me uneasy, I hope we learn about his backstory.

Cheers!

Finished **Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis** which was very enjoyable. Loved the amazing fantasy world of angels, demons and mystical creatures, and the OST was great. Writing could be better, but it's still a really fun show, especially if you're a fantasy lover like me.

Started **Robotics;Notes** and am currently on episode 8, I really like it so far. I love the softcore scifi slice of life setting and the interesting concepts the show deals with. The quality of animation here is fantastic, even though it's relatively lacking art-wise and there's quite a few QUALITY moments. I like the character interactions and the story's been pretty interesting so far, so I'm really looking forward to watching more episodes of this show.
>> ARTICLE
**Zetsun no Tempest (24/24)**, don't hear too much about this anime. I've seen it twice now and I have to say it has one of the most satisfying endings I've seen in a long time. I mean the first half of the show was by far the best part of the show but I was completely satisfied by the direction that each of the characters are headed. The action in this series is also pretty cool, of course this is where I think the second half falters. They focus on a romance that has practically no momentum until the last few episodes. They could have done a lot of cool things with the magic implemented in the world, hell even introducing a branch family that uses different types of magic rather than the strictly defensive type we see in the series. The second half drags it down from what could have been a 10/10 to an **(8/10)**

**Bleach** I just finished season 1 for the second or third time. It's really one of my favorite action series when it's not a filler arc. Bleach when executing the story correctly does so incredibly well. The first three seasons are arguable some of the best seasons in action anime. They slowly add a huge cast to the show but no so fast that you are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of names you have to remember if you plan on understanding the story that is ahead. For where I am in the story I'll give it an **(8/10**

**Black Bullet** I finished this a few days ago and my only definitive opinion on the series is that its forgettable. I mean the characters are fine I suppose, the fighting is nothing too special, and while the ending left me curious towards the future in their world I'm not in too big of a hurry to find out what happens next. Eh **(6/10)**

**Hamatora: The Animation/Re:Hamatora (24/24)** I really enjoyed this series. While the MC wasn't the most original main character I've seen Nice is still really enjoyable to watch. The story is surprisingly compelling. I was drawn in almost immediately and really looked forward to what was going to happen next. The first season was more episodic and disconnected which was fine for what the show was, a detective show in which the MC's have various powers, the second season however was way more serialized and it took nothing away from how much I liked the first season. Although my two complaints would be that I liked the season one villain more than the season two villain and Hajime was really underused in both seasons. Easily **(9/10)**

>> ARTICLE
Rewatching **FLCL** and it's even better the second time around. The characterization is amazing, it's possibly the most stylish anime I've ever seen, and of course it still has my favourite soundtrack from an anime. The Pillows > all. Think I might bump my rating of it up to a 9/10.

The burden of living up to expectations, the strange and foreign and new thoughts, the sexuality, the independence and making things happen for yourself, the conflict with parents and what you believe an adult to be, the realization that the world can be a harsh place, the general craziness of the anime is similar to the ride of adolescence, and the list goes on. It really describes puberty well, even better than I remember. To say that "it is about puberty" is something that I agree with, but there's so much that goes into it than four words can justify. 

Even if you think it's over stylized or nonsensical, it's truly timeless and a must watch for any anime fan.

Tokyo Ravens. Quite a fun anime, magic based with numerous characters, it is based around a school for a lot of it but the pacing manages to keep it from being boring. Characters are interesting and each one is well developed and interesting enough. Story line is decent as well. 

Omamori Himari - This was a fun anime, a little daft at times but the overall storyline was enjoyable, the characters were well done with a variety. 

Gj-Bu - Seen this recommended a few times and decided to finally watch it. For such a simple concept and most of the show taking place in one room it is still an enjoyable watch. One of the few animes I was sad when it ended, a nice easy to watch SoL. 


>> ARTICLE
**K-On!** - Wanted to watch something lighthearted but damn was this show REALLY lighthearted. It really isn't any more than what people say it iscute girls doing cute things, which is both a plus and a minus for me. 

7/10

**Code Geass R1 + R2 -** After the relaxing tea time that was watching K-On!, I was down to really sink my teeth into a complex story with powerful characters and themes. I sure got those things from Code Geass, but also a lot of other crap that just made me face palm over and over. I've heard people call it a train wreck, which admittedly it kind of is, but it's a train wreck that resolves in a beautiful way. The ending to Geass is perfect. I think my biggest problem with Code Geass was that it always seemed like the writers were pulling things out of their ass just to create more drama for Lelouch. The journey very much felt like a 1 step forward, 2 steps back sort-of deal, which is where I think the train wreck comes from. Overall though, great series, deserves the love it gets.

**Currently watching [Clannad: After Story](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad:_After_Story) (11/24)**

I am currently watching Clannad: After Story because apparently everyone else has already seen Clannad: After Story and I don't want to be left out the next time someone talks about Clannad: After Story.
 
The thing I've noticed is that when it's not being awful, the show is actually pretty good. Stuff like Tomoya's conversations with Yoshino or just the general narrative approach to his character really lend it a strong, understated personality that I don't think I've really seen very much before. And its shown it can still rise to some pretty incredible heights when it wants to - this is the stuff of the KyoAni Magic that inevitably draws me to their works no matter how much garbage they put out. Miyazawa's arc may have felt pretty pointless and arbitrary *but goddamn that KyoAni Magic made my eyes watery anyway.*

...Unfortunately with Nagisa existing and all that it still decides to be awful quite often. But thats a story for another day.

**Dog Days S1** Takeshi's Castle the anime. I really liked the concept of solving problems by having giant game show where those countries compete. Looking forward to the rest.

**Suisei No Gargantia** Waterworld X space mecha the anime. Holy shit, I don't know what I expected but what I got was truly glorious. The setting itself was probably the best part. [I mean just look at it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ-L3UBv5wg). It was really breath of fresh air after watching ton of stuff which almost always more or less revolves around bunch of highschoolers.

**Highschool DxD** Pretty decent, I gave it a 7/10 because it did have a decent story and characters to what i expected from such a plot heavy anime. Will probably start the next season this week.

**Hyouka** Currently on episode 12, a strange one in that I enjoy it but can't binge it so only watch a couple of episodes a night. Currently giving it a 8/10 as I really enjoy the characters/story but there's definitely something that holds me back from watching it all in a oner.  Will try and finish it next week

**No game No life** 10/10 -  Loved everything about it from the characters to the music to the gorgeous visuals to the great story. Honestly this anime blew me away with how much i enjoyed it, so much so I'm rewatching it again due to in the hope i missed some bits by blasting through it too quickly

**Hunter x Hunter**: I didn't expect it to be soo good. When I first saaw this anime i felt like i'd never watch it since it looked kinda childish, but because friends convinced me to watch it i watched it and man was it good. I rated it 10/10 best thing mangs.

**Monogatari Second Season**: after I finished Nekomonogatari I just wanted more! And oh boy was I in for a ride. I got ready for the feel trip and finished it today. I rated it 9/10

**Gintama**: watched a couple episode (50-58). I watched it to cheer myself up, but I don't like to watch it too much in on sitting.

**Mushishi**: Episodes (8-11) It's just so beautifull!
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats - It was really good, however the whole story felt a little bit rushed. With more time to form connections with the characters (backstory, [this](/s "How each of them died in the real world; having the story of Otonashi pulled me in deep."), etc.) the show would be even better. Can't wait for the VN!

**Hunter x Hunter (2011)  20/148**  20 episodes in and loving it so far.

**Barakamon  12/12**  A great slice of life that was a nice change of pace from all the drama in Nana.

**Nana  47/47**  Such an interesting story is told here. Realistic characters who have more than one side to them and do things impulsively sometimes. I was a little disappointed in the ending, but it wasn't too bad.

**[Gintama'](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9969/Gintama) (6-13/51)** - Four Devas arc, which takes over as my new favorite story in the series since I like Otose. [More in the weekly thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2til0y/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_207214/cnzdgu4)

**[Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) (1-26/26) & [End of Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion:_The_End_of_Evangelion)** - That was quite the trip. Marathoned episodes 11-26 in one night and while the story was good for the most part, the TV ending really dragged down my view of the series. I know End of Evangelion is the "true" ending and it was definitely fitting but episodes 25 and 26 still stand. Started rewatching it immediately after for the discussion group but I'm not sure I'll stay with it.

**[Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo) (16-24/24)** - Best girl did not win, alas. Had a lot of fun with the discussion group, which helped since it was quite predictable story-wise. First thing I've seen in a while that makes me want to write my own fanfic for a different ending.

**[Sakura Trick](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20047/Sakura_Trick) (1-3/12)** - Light on story but it's all very cute. Also lots of yuri action. Good contrast to Evangelion for sure.

**The Tatami Galaxy**

I finished this in like 2 days.  This show is the best anime that I have seen so far.  

**Monogatari Season 2**

Mayoi Jiangshi Arc

This arc was really strong.  I really like Shinobu in this one and I feel like she's growing into a great character.

Nadeko Medusa Arc

Really hated this arc.  Maybe hated is too strong of a word, because there was some interesting things that happened story-wise (Ougi especially) but i really disliked the ending and i think that Nadeko is a pretty weak character.  Is the entire point of this arc that kids take things too seriously and pretend that everything in their life is extremely dramatic?

Just finished Yu Yu Hakusho today. I remembered watching it as a kid back on Toonami as a kid and decided to watch through all of it. Overall im very satisfied with all of it. The ending was great and left me with a very satisfied feeling. I'd have to say my favorite part is the dark tournament arc mainly due to the great fights, character progression, and just overall awesomeness. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched **Kara no Kyoukai: Paradox Spiral**.  Really sweet animation, great music, and 2 super cool characters introduced [](/s "only to die, as normal.")  Really liked the jumpy nature of time, but missed a lot of the Shiki/Kokutou interaction.  Also Touko is a badass.

Doubt I'll be watching anymore of the series anytime soon, as I can only take so much depression, but still good stuff.
>> ARTICLE
**Darker Than Black: Ryuusei No Gemini** - I actually really enjoyed it, and I've seen Season 1. I guess a lot of people don't like how different it is structure wise?

**Naruto Shippuden ANBU Arc** - I switched to the manga a long time ago but this filler arc intrigued me. I've been watching a lot of clean, beautifully animated shows recently so this isn't as pleasant on the eyes, but I enjoyed seeing more of ANBU and Kakashi.
>> ARTICLE
I binged **Clannad Afterstory** within the span of three days. Needless to say I was an emotional wreck.  
Because I was such an emotional wreck, I wanted to watch something awesome, so I started **Hunter x Hunter 2011**. I'm not too far in but it seems really cool so far, and the ED is probably my favorite ED of any show to date.

Psycho Pass.

I blasted through the first season in 3 days or so. It was okay, not as amazing as it was hyped up to be, but definitely watchable, and I'll be checking out S2 once it's finished airing (even though I've heard it's not as good).
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari- got up to episode 9, I previously watched the first episode but dropped it due to getting confused but this was most likely because I was watching it while falling asleep in bed. This time I understood the dialogues and understood the story behind it. I like it and I will continue to watch it.

Finshed **Darker than Black** season 2 yesterday after watching DtB S1, reading the manga and the OVAs. Really wanna talk about it and how I actually liked it even though most claim S2 wasn't great, but this isn't a thread for that. Gonna start watching **Ping Pong** with dinner tonight.

**Heroic Age**

I liked this anime. The story is nice although it leaves some questions unanswered. I especially liked the princess [Dhianeila](http://myanimelist.net/character/2447/Dhianeila_Y_Leisha_Altoria_Ol_Yunos) and her VA who also voiced Mikasa from AoT. 

**Suisei no Gargantia**

Decent show but not very convincing. 

**Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei**

Best thing i ever watched.

two things, one rewatch and one new but very by-the-books franchise so I know how its going to be kinda

I rewatched **Gundam 0080, War in the Pocket** with a friend, his first time seeing it, and it was the perfect punch in the gut that I remembered it as. My favorite gundam series overall, for being so subversive to what makes this 'anti-war franchise that survives by selling war toys to kids' series work

the second thing I started watching, on a whim was **Heartcatch Precure**, I just wanted something simple, and this isn't my first precure or anything so I know what I'm getting into. So far (6/49) so good, I really like the villain group's aesthetics and the heroines are fun too

*formulaic was the word I wanted to say earlier, not really by-the books
>> ARTICLE
**Akame ga Kill!** (26/26)

Thoroughly enjoyable, I enjoyed getting to see a little of who each of the characters were without all of the focus just being on Tatsumi, and I thought the lore with the Imperial Arms was engrossing, too. I was a little disappointed in the fact that Akame herself doesn't get too much attention near the end of the series, but I was happy to see Mine occupy a greater role as things went on, too. Not too action-heavy, good characters, and quite a roller coaster of emotions. 8.5/10

I'm surprised people are still commenting since it's so late in the thread.

I'm recently watching **Aria: The Animation**.  I've just finished episode 3 yesterday.  This anime is pure slice of life gold.

Lately I've been so busy with school and thinking about what I want to do with my life, so I haven't been watching much animu or browsing this subreddit much.

**White Album** - I actually watched this on accident, making the common mistake of thinking it was White Album 2. It wasn't as bad as a lot of people claim, but did run into a lot of issues (mainly budget and characterization plotholes). I really liked it for its serious tone and unique subject, but the VN is probably leagues better. 7 or 8/10.

*PS* Haruka a best

**White Album 2** - This, on the other hand, utterly destroyed me. What seemed like an average high school romance ended up being so much more for me, and I'm still all choked up thinking about it. It nodded to many of the cliches of modern anime without indulging in them, spent time nurturing the main characters, and concluding with a devastatingly powerful ending. 9/10.
>> ARTICLE
Ano Natsu de Matteru (6/12) -- This is pretty enjoyable so far. I'm liking that the romance is a little more straightforward than your average high school anime and its pretty well characterised so far. I'm disappointed that it's going to have to wrap this up in only 6 more episodes, though. I'll be pleasantly surprised if it isn't clunky and rushed.
>> ARTICLE
**Sakurasou (22-24/24)**

I loved Sakurasou at the start mainly because each of the character was realistically flawed and I felt that it was refreshing seeing an imperfect, normal protagonist struggling through life. The contrast of the MC to a person who seems to have autistic spectrum disorder (but very much a savant) was well done. 

Yet, my enjoyment of Sakurasou pretty much vanished at around the 20 episode mark. The [plot point introduced](/s "where Sakurasou was going to be torn down") felt like unnecessary drama, I struggled to get through the episodes, and eventually I put this on hold for at least 3 months. 

It was thanks to the rewatch club on /r/anime that gave me the motivation to get back to it, and I'm glad I did. The final two episodes redeemed the show for me. Maybe it's because the plot point that annoyed me [](/s "finally got resolved,"), or maybe it's just that the final two episodes were enjoyable ([](/s "I wasn't too big a fan of the graduation scene and the train station scene felt cliche, but there's still something heartwarming about it all")). Whatever the case, I finally finished Sakurasou, and all things considered, I'll rate it a 7/10.

Welcome to the NHK. 
Must-watch! Really good show.

Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora. 
Loved it. Happy and sad things will happen. If you are easy to cry, you will cry. I almost cried, which tells a lot.

Myself ; Yourself. 
Also quite a good watch, but I thought it was a bit predictable at times.

Overall all of them were good watched and were in somewhat the same genre.
>> ARTICLE
Making my way through [Soul Eater NOT!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21507/Soul_Eater_NOT!) atm and I have to say... I'm pretty disappointed so far. 2 eps in and it's as if they've removed the whole halloween/action theme the very good original series had and turned the show into more of a slice of life with touch of nostalgia after seeing a few old chars. Really hope it picks up because I loved Soul Eater and just wanted more of the same.

Recently finished [KenIchi: The Mightiest Disciple](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1559/Shijou_Saikyou_no_Deshi_Kenichi) and its follow-up OVA series. It was ok. I feel if Miu and Shinpaku had done a bit more fighting and the anime lost the whole "I don't fight girls" bullshit Kenichi has going it could have been much better.

Fate Zero 

Watched all the episodes, what a fantastically well done show. Too depressing for my usual liking though (I watched this after watching Fate/Stay Night UBW on Crunchyroll, and preferred that personally due to its slightly lighter nature). 

My only question is how the hell does Kotomine keep up that ultra-baritone voice? Seriously, there are massive action scenes and all I can think about is "Damn, that is an awesome voice."

**Nagi no Asukara (26/26)** - I'm really getting too old for childish drama. Admittedly, I was expecting an anime focused around the setting rather than the characters. So it goes without saying that I wasn't impressed when the anime turned into a love polygone/hexagone shenanigan. Still I have to give it to the anime for at least having a good focus; Nagi no Asukara really is a show about love in both the romantic and platonic sense and has no problem showing it. Anyway, I gave it a **5/10**.
>> ARTICLE
**Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei** - Watching

I'm very surprised by this. The opinions seem to be very different when it comes to this. But I'm really enjoying this. MC is really good, so is his sister. And all the side characters pre pretty interesting as well. The action and magic looks great. It really reminds me of Code Geass, just not so grand and without mecha.

**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** - Finished - **6/10**

This was a big let down. The first 2 episodes are really good, like 8/10 good, maybe even higher. The potential  for great romcom is there. And the shows takes it and rips it apart. Seriously, there is zero development (even the side character got more development then MCs). If there is one thing I really hate, it's shows where nothing happens for the entire time. And people complain about Nisekoi. The comedy is good though, but that's it.

**Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya** - Finished - **6/10**

The first half drags insufferably (actually dropped it for 2 weeks there). But then it gets really good. The action is fantastic! And well, the characters are really cute. Also, catgirl Tohsaka.

**Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya 2wei!** - Finished - **8/10**

Thankfully continues in steps of the second half of S1. Great fights, cute characters, yuri and maid Tohsaka.

Kara no Kyoukai and Shinseki Yori. I'm liking both so far, I just dislike how confusing Kara no Kyoukai can be (Why make the movies out of chronological order?) and the random changes of art styles in Shinseki Yori can be a bit annoying.

**Monogatarie second season (17/26)**:  I really didn't like Bakemonogatarie all that mutch but i feel the more i watch from this franchise the better it gets  and so far this has been the best season. I hope the last 2 arcs won't disappoint me.

**Kuroko no Basket seasons 1 and 2 (50/50)**

My god, I'm missing my daily binge of basketball already ;_;. This series is really incredible, I was watching 8-9 episodes a day consistently. If anyone is a bit doubtful about the sports genre, this is a really solid entry anime, even if it does get a bit too shounen-esque halfway into the series. 9/10
>> ARTICLE
**Spice and Wolf (8-13/13)**

This was my first sort of slice of life anime and I deeply enjoyed it. I really loved the interactions between Lawrence and Holo.

**Spice and Wolf II (1-6/12)**

Even though there was less Holo later on in this arc I still really loved it, not as much (so far) as the first season. Still very good though.

**Naruto Shippuden (363-394)**

I just wanted to catch up to the current Naruto Shippuden episode.

**One Piece (17-43/)**

I am trying to catch up to the airing One Piece eventually. These two arcs with Sanji and Nami were great and I loved both of them. Definitely better than the Usopp arc.

I mar(i)athoned through [**Maria+Holic**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5030/Maria%E2%80%A0Holic) this week. Certainly your healthy dose of Shaft, but also just a damn funny show. It's different and it's comedy does stand out. Also sports one of the more unique Miyuki Sawashiro roles I've heard (I'll leave what character for you to figure out on your own.) and one of the [best openings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOHwVZc6QYY) I've seen. 

There are some scenes that drag on and aren't nearly as funny as the rest, but over all it was a good watch and I recommend it.

> I would expect so. The openings are one of the main things I look forward to in any Shaft show. Similarly with Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei; they just keep getting better and better with each season.

Oh man I'm loving M.H. getting some love, that show really deserves more attention! If you liked it I suggest [Arakawa Under the Bridge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7647/Arakawa_Under_the_Bridge) for over the top comedy just like M.H.

###[Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) (200-201/201) + [Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9969) (1-5/51)

Discussion thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2sqiv1/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_200206/).

I think its difficult to describe the appeal of Gintama and what makes it special as each viewer is likely to take away something different from it. This is the case because, at its heart, Gintama is a celebration of anime and media in and of itself. It is an appreciation of stories as an art and how they can be expressed in this medium. Thats why its characters are portrayed as consumers of media. They apply their experiences in manga, movies, anime, and pop culture to the stories that they act out, often drawing humor from their knowledge when things dont go as expected. It makes sense that Sorachi tries his hand at any and all story types and genres. His world is a platform to explore these things, to flex his strengths in composition, and to let the course of things go in whatever direction he wants. The show is unbounded because it *needs* to constantly find new ground to tread in order to work within its objectives. It builds upon itself so that it can contribute to what it admires. Everything it has as its disposal is used to its capacity and then some. It has left me with some of the most memorable characters, fights, clarity, drama, and gags I have come across and has come to the point that I cant imagine going a week without diving back into Edo.

Ive spilled a lot of ink sharing my reactions to the show with the watch group. I can say with certainty that it added a lot to the experience as a viewer and Id like to extend my thanks to /u/onurtag for organizing it and for everyone who has participated and interacted with me. 

###[Aria the Natural](http://myanimelist.net/anime/962) (17-26/26)

*Recommended by:* /u/masterofgo

**Warning**: This is going to get sappy *fast*. Gloss or skip over if thats not your thing.

> May the kindness of this town reach the hearts of many people

Thoughts on Aria the Animation can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2oklrx/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cmnzyip). Pretty much everything I stated there holds true in this season, so Im just going to talk on what I think is the purpose of Natural.

Akari often describes her experiences as encounters, as though they are some form of small-scale accidents or happenstances that mean little at face value but aggregate into something almost indescribable. Almost:

> After spending so much time together, there are times when everyone stops talking. Its a wonderful stillness that happens naturally. I cant help but love moments like this.

Aria is a show that knows *how* to express itself in its most tender moments, allowing itself to burrow into you as a viewer and soothe you with its enriching story and culture such that your appreciation of it grows in the same manner that its encounters fortify Akaris imprint on the city and the citys embrace of her [](/s ", sometimes in cat form no less"). Throughout its run, there is a sense of gradual change and growth in the girls, that their personalities echo their mentors, that each character is at a transitional point in their lives. While the future may bring about uncertain changes, the bonds that they formed through chance encounters in the city that they admire will grant them continued happiness and fulfillment.

###[Ghost Hunt](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1571) (1-13/25)

*Recommended by:* brother

By chance Mai Taniyama gets involved with a paranormal investigator and assists in a series of cases where she learns of spirits, curses, hexes, and other otherworldly phenomena. The shows approach in these cases feels scientific, where each investigator offers a different angle to identify and attack a problem. This builds a working basis of knowledge in both Mai and the viewer, laying down a tree of logic for each following arc. As a result, cases grow in complexity as you move forward in the series and, while their resolutions continually play well into what is presented thematically for the arc, the stories are crafted in such a way that there is enough variety and mystery to keep me interested in and of themselves. Episodes pass by quickly. Putting down an arc a night is fairly easy; it helps that an episode usually ends at a point that baits you into continuing. And the music is just so immersive if you happen to be watching by monitor-light. If theres one thing that Ghost Hunt excels in, it would be how it draws you into an investigation and how it builds up to the appearance of a spirit to elicit the feeling of fear that it wants out of you in those moments.

There exist a few quirks that take some getting used to. For some reason, the show likes to use sliding frames of varying sizes when it wants to convey a shift in pace in any given story. Otherwise, theres not too much to talk about in the way of art & animation. J.C. Staff does a solid job in both the quiet and thrilling segments, though I wouldnt call the look of it memorable. The way in which the primary cast is introduced is done in a sort of clumsy manner and their group dynamic felt more hammy than natural in the first case. Naru himself is quite stoic and distant at present, so the only person I can latch onto is Mai, though I feel that is the intention of the author.  I dont know if its Funimation or the show itself, but the word choice makes me chuckle. I mean, who even uses words like galling and bunkum anymore?

[Fantastic OP & ED Pairing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oAL1JVH1U8).

Lastly, I hear a lot of Season 2 when? talk when researching community reactions so I worry that the show doesnt end in a satisfying place.

**Hellsing Ultimate**

Edgiest thing since hexagons, its so ridiculously over the top that it almost becomes a comedy 8/10

**Psycho Pass**

One of my new favorite antagonists, everything just seemed to fit so well together by the end and felt really concluding. 9/10

**Magi: The Kingdom of Magic**

I liked the Hogwarts shit but towards the end it defiantly devolved into a slightly more generic battle shonen, still a fun watch and would like a third season 7/10

**Mushishi** 

God damn this show was so relaxing and the [op](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4si-j4XmzzU) was beautiful. took me a while to get through since it was so episodic. defiantly looking forward to watching the second season 9/10

**Welcome to the NHK** - Finally got around to watching it. It was a great show with some powerful moments, but god damn was Satou an incredibly frustrating character, though that would be the whole point of the show. It was about a broken person who was aware of his dire situation but couldn't bring himself out of it. Misaki definitely made the show for me. She was such a lovable character that you couldn't help but feel for throughout the show, especially at the end.

**Tamako Market and Love Story** - Watched this last week but whatever. Very relaxing show to watch with some nice characters. Barely went anywhere but still enjoyed just watching Tamako, Mochizou, and the rest of her family and friends, and the movie offered the fulfilling progression that we all wanted. The last scene in Love Story might be one of the most heartwarming moments I've seen.

**Gintama Benizakura Movie**- Oh wait I watched it dubbed, so I need so call it the "*Cherry Blossom*" movie. (/)_(\\) However "Captain Katsura and the Badass Motherfucker Motherfucking" has a certain poetic flair so I'll give it a pass. Good retelling, and the added scenes of while they were kids are nice. 

**Attack on Titan** (1-15)- Dang, this show is actually pretty cool. 

And as a fujoshi I- I have a confession to make.. Until yesterday, I'd never actually watched **Free** (1-3) except for parodies... ^^^and ^^^^doujins

**Fate/Zero**

I just stayed up until 2 last night to finish this. My god, that was amazing. I loved nearly every character, the animation was gorgeous, the climax was fantastic even though I already knew what was going to happen. OPs and EDs that I never wanted to skip past. I could go on and on about this.

**Love Live**

I didn't want to enjoy this. My friend convinced me to watch it, and at first the weird 3D opening left a bad taste for me. But damn if it isn't addicting. I'm a sucker for a good soundtrack, and I don't just mean the insert songs.

**Ghost in the Shell SAC**

I've seen four episodes so far. It's really good and I'm enjoying it, but it hasn't gripped me and made me feel like I need to keep watching. I see maybe 2 a week.

**Kuroko no Basket**

Another one my friend made me watch. So silly, so satisfying. Halfway through season 1.

Tonight, I'm either going to start Unlimited Blade Works, or Code Geass. I legitimately don't know which one will win out yet.

Finished Macross Frontier. Was awesome. We need more space operas!

AnoHana the movie was an excellent conclusion to the series. Really liked how they mixed scenes from the tv series with the new scenes in the movie for an emotional conclusion.

And finished A Letter to Momo. One of Production IG's hidden gems of the past 5 years. Nice amount of comedy and drama intertwined with a coming of age story.

Ga-Rei: Zero: As a show that I almost never hear about, this show is now among my top 10 shows. Would definitly reccomend to anyone who likes emotional action anime.

Selector Wixoss: Loved the first season and kinda reminded me of Madoka Magica. Second season was however much worse with the antagonists goals being much less ambigious and some things being a bit crazy and hard to believe
>> ARTICLE
Concerning *Ga-Rei Zero* - when do you get to know what is happening? Because I watched 3 or 4 episodes and still had no idea what is it about. It seems like every episode just kept adding questions but never answered any.
>> ARTICLE
The first two eps are basically troll, then it gets going afterwards. It took me two tries to get through that barrier as well.

The actual show (ignoring the completely useless first couple eps) is incredible, though. The anime turned out good enough that the author of the manga changed its actual tone to take after the anime after it was released.

It's one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
It gets hinted what is going to happen/happened at the start of the series at around episode 7 or so I believe. I think the events of episode 2 take place in episode 10. 

Currently you are at the episode where the relationship between Yomi and Kagura is shown, which most of the show is focused on. It is the lightest part of the series, but very soon the mood switches back to what it was during episode 1 and 2. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, that seals it then. I watched it because of the gif of the famous pocky scene. I got to see that and if there is just more foreshadowing for nest 3 episodes, I just can't be bothered. 
>> ARTICLE
Everything between the first 2 or 3 eps and last 2 or 3 eps is basically the set up of what's going on.
>> ARTICLE
**Grave of the Fireflies**- Didn't like it at all. I won't go in depth here but I disliked all characters; especially the MC who I think behaved in such a fashion that in retrospect I can't even feel bad for him or his sister due to his actions in the movie.

**Banner of the Stars** 13/13- Another great entry into the series. The dialogue was still great but not quite as good while the space battles were fantastic. The plot wasn't quite as interesting but was faster paced.

**SoulTaker** 13/13- A very obscure anime that just so happens to be one of Akiyuki Shinbou's earliest work. The same person who made the Monotagari series that is. It was basically a post evangelion series minus the mecha and usual plot points ( or does it?) done with Shinbou's distinctive style. The first episode is a mess so get past that if you are going to try and watch it. I liked it a lot personally but it felt like a mess while I was watching it(but a fun one for me at least) but it did all make sense at the end. If you like Evangelion's brand of convoluted ness and random symbolism/imagery then I'd say give it a shot. Or if you just want to try one of the earlier works by a now very popular director. 

As usual I posted fairly abbreviated thoughts on the series I watched in this thread. I almost always make a post in /r/TrueAnime before this one that is much much longer. This weeks post can be found[ here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2snfno/your_week_in_anime_week_118/cnrg2hf) I'd love to get some other thoughts on SoulTaker since no one commented on it in the other discussion thread but I got plenty of other posts telling me why I was wrong about Fireflies.

>> ARTICLE
Nowadays Shinbou puts his name on projects without actually directing them -- part of the 'school of...' system [apparently](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/akiyuki-shinbo/) operating at Shaft. So earlier things like SoulTaker and Tenamonya Voyagers are a valuable point of closer contact with his personal style rather than Shaft's house style. I'll admit I haven't seen all of it, but I didn't drop it in disgust or anything, I was just busy when I was trying to watch it! But it's cool to see a powersuit/tokusatsu-styled show with a JAM Project OP &c &c but Shinbou's style. I should watch the second half.
>> ARTICLE
That's a fair point. I haven't seen much by Shaft but I've noticed that they have a lot of common elements from their shows and in general have fairly similar plots. SoulTaker definitely does have Shinbou's art style to the extreme and has a lot of really funky camera work as well. Can't blame you for putting it on hold. The first half is pretty uninteresting for the most part but the second half has a lot of really cool reveals. The plot starts to get very convoluted and the imagery intensifies. The MC even get's crucified at one point. 
>> ARTICLE
>  I think behaved in such a fashion that in retrospect I can't even feel bad for him or his sister due to his actions in the movie.

I don't understand this viewpoint. Does a character have to be perfect and noble for you to have sympathy for them? Just because the MC was too prideful and it caused him to make very poor decisions he's no longer deserving of sympathy? Wasn't his goal of protecting his sister throughout this hell noble enough to warrant sympathy?

At any rate, [as I pointed out in this comment,](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2su39g/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cntfper) the director was attempting to convey how youth being too prideful and not respecting their elders was a poisonous way for them to behave.
>> ARTICLE
No that's not perfect and noble. It's making human and realistic decisions. And yes I saw that statement from the wikepedia article. It actually started my reflection on the movie and let that to my view. I explain my viewpoint a bit better in the TrueAnime thread.
>> ARTICLE
>I explain my viewpoint a bit better in the TrueAnime thread.

Hmmm well I rarely make it over to that subreddit so I guess I'll probably miss it. It's probably been close to 6 months since I last made a comment over there.

My bad! Wow my comment seems pointless after reading what you wrote in your longer analysis. It's almost like you wrote that after reading my comment! Spooky! Guess I should've paid closer attention.

I told you I avoid /r/trueanime, and [my leaving an absurdly long comment in that thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2snfno/your_week_in_anime_week_118/cntisi8?context=3) shows you why. I get completely sucked in and write absurdly long comments over there! Damnit! [How am I gonna make time for posting K-On gifs if I'm writing essays in that subreddit?!](http://i.imgur.com/YW7CuRQ.gif)

Also, I checked your MAL and saw you haven't seen WA2 yet, so avoid that spoiler text for WA2 in my commment. "No duh!", right?
>> ARTICLE
Yea we all text wall when post in r/Trueanime. You just open any thread at random and almost every comment is a text wall. It's great. I personally much prefer their weekly what did you watch thread for that reason. When it happens here it's like: Here's a sentence about every show I watched this week! Over there its: Here's a 5 paragraph explaining the themes of X show and how that leads to my final thoughts on it. Alas I realize that if I did that here no one would bother reading. 
>> ARTICLE
> Here's a sentence about every show I watched this week! Over there its: Here's a 5 paragraph explaining the themes of X show and how that leads to my final thoughts on it. Alas I realize that if I did that here no one would bother reading.

See here is where we differ. I tend to fall into the former group when it comes to the vast majority of the anime I watch(hmmm that was bad/okay/better than most, time to move on!). But for my very favorite anime(~top 20) I fall into the latter group, rambling on and on about every aspect of the show I find worthwhile and thirstily soaking up every bit of insight into them that I can. 

This brings me to the other reason I don't go to /r/trueanime that much. While I can get sucked into a comment chain regarding one of my favorites, I have to wade through paragraph after paragraph about anime I simply *do not care that much about*. I find /r/trueanime to be largely unenjoyable because of that. 
>> ARTICLE
That's very true. I honestly don't read most of it but then again there is far less content then there is here and I only read a fraction of the stuff here as well. And I generally like what I see more over there. I enjoy it the most on either sub when I find someone who has seen something that I want to talk about and try to talk about it with them. I like true anime a tiny bit more for that because they tend to have watched some more obscure stuff similar to a lot of the stuff I watch and they are a bit more likely to give longer responses. 
>> ARTICLE
/r/animesuggest also does a weekly discussion thread that is just perfect for me. People post about the anime they watched last week and write a few sentences about what they liked. It's not a chore to read since there are very few walls of text, but if someone watches one of my favorites I can get a good discussion going with them. Much easier to sift through than /r/trueanime and much more enjoyable for me as a result of that.

Yay movie week

[**Neon Genesis Evangelion \(20-26/26\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=30)

[**End of Evangelion \(1/1\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=32)

Well then. 25-26 was pretty low budget, I have to admit. I didn't particularly have huge qualms about the writing, but I couldn't ignore the atrocious animation and couldn't shake the feeling that the script was specifically made so that as little money was used on animation as possible (so dreamy, dialogue heavy, abstract, no action at any cost). There was also that huge leap that was initially confusing, and End of Evengelion addresses it better than NGE.  EoE itself was pretty amazing. It was still confusing, but compared to 25/26, I think everyone would take EoE hands down. Also I don't know why there were so many Christian references in the anime, I'm not religious or knowledgeable about the bible so I feel most of it was wasted on me, but I did get a feel for some of the general themes.

NGE: Rank 41 (9/10)

EoE: Rank 21 (10/10)

[**Death Billiards \(1/1\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=14353)

Wanted to watch this before I watch Death Parade. Honestly I found it to be average and a tad boring until 30 yr old kun [spoilers](/s "went on his speech. Everything after was pretty cool and thought provoking as well"). Also that dude would make an excellent politician, dodging the questions no matter the cost. Death Parade should be able to improve further with more time for character development and plot.

Rank 58 (8/10)

[**Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei (1/1)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=2593)

[**Kara no Kyoukai 2: Satsujin Kousatsu \(Part 1\) (1/1)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=3782)

[**Kara no Kyoukai 3: Tsuukaku Zanryuu \(1/1\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=3783)

Shiki is one of my favorite characters in anime already, so you can probably guess what my ratings for these will be already. Brilliant series, lots of action, and each movie holds up on its own individually, but are better together. Also, as its named Garden of Sinners in English, you can guess what the main theme of the series is. Yeah, lots of murder and other atrocities (as well as varying perspectives on said activities), so definitely not lighthearted. It is NOT a gorefest though, that's not what I'm implying, as it has a decent plot and characters. I have some theories, especially on the second movie, that will be confirmed or refuted once I complete the series, so I'll withhold them for now.

Kara no Kyoukai 1: Rank 35 (9/10)

Kara no Kyoukai 2: Rank 54 (8/10)

Kara no Kyoukai 3: Rank 36 (9/10)

*Current ratings for all movies may change depending on the quality of subsequent movies, consider it a de facto preliminary ranking.

**TTGL**

Holy shit, that was an amazing ride. Why didn't I watch this sooner? This is one of those anime that is life-changing, as I say. Like everything, the show has its flaws, but the high one feels during the battles is amazing. Most characters are well-written, and I found the pacing to be perfect. It became one of my favorite anime ever.

**Hellsing: Ultimate**

I just finished it this week, and it's amazing. The dub is great, and, imo, superior the sub. It's so over-the-top, and Alucard is so based. Seras Victoria, Integra, Anderson, and Walter are amazing characters, too.

**Kuroko no Basket, seasons 1 & 2**

This is really high school basketball players with supernatural powers... and I love it. The overall show is amazing, the writing is good, the comedy is good, the characters are very good, and the pacing is good. Definitely glad I caught up with this. Best sports anime I've seen up until now.

I'll be starting **Durarara** and **Jojo's Bizarre Adventure** this week, and I'll finally have caught up on this season.

Have you seen Ping Pong yet?

No, I haven't. I've only heard good things about it, though. I'll watch it once I'm up-to-date in Durarara (2 episodes in and I don't know what to expect), Jojo, and Shirobako, which I've been ignoring for the time being.

Also, if only Slam Dunk's anime adaptation had been finished, it could be my favorite sports anime. Alas, that'll never happen.
>> ARTICLE
Durarara is amazing. I'm sure you'll enjoy that. I recommend Ping Pong ASAP because it's only around 10ish episodes.

Oh yeah, it is. I'm already 5 episodes in, and I'm loving it.

I already have Ping Pong, and I'll watch it in a week or so. 11 episodes go fast.

Touch. Binge-watched the entire anime throughout the week, in fact. Pretty good, though obviously not as good as Cross Game. Still, Adachi Mitsuru delivered again, can't complain about having watched it.

If you want more you can watch Miyuki next as the it got fansubbed at last only few weeks ago.

It's a 'but ... but we are not blood related' type of show, because Adachi Mitsuru was decades ahead of the light-novel industry.

**K-On!! The Movie** - Watched this a couple nights ago. I made a post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2skn7p/free_talk_fridays_week_of_january_16_2015/cnqdxlc) that basically described my thoughts on it. As someone commented on that post, K-On The Movie basically took all the things that made K-On good and put them into a two-hour movie format. All in all, it was a really fun experience that combined a mix of a lot of different emotions.

**No Game No Life (12/12)** - Finally tackled No Game No Life after putting it off for months (Hearing people both trash on it and sing it's praises made me more interested). Honestly, I think it's in the middle ground. It was a really fun experience where, even though you always knew  wasn't going to lose, it was still really interesting to see how they would win and the methods they would use. However, the ending left the show on a really sour note for me, and I hope a Season 2 does eventually come along to tie up the loose ends (Though, I feel if they had ended the show maybe two minutes earlier, before the scene with the Old Deus, it would have been a passable ending)

**Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu/Gonna Be The Twin-Tail!! (1-3/12)** - Decided on a whim to pick this one up after finishing NGNL, because the concept really got me curious: A boy with a twintail fetish who transforms into basically a twintail magical girl to fight evil aliens...who want to steal the world's twintails. So far, it's definitely grabbed me in, it's pretty funny and they really just decided to go all-out with the zany comedy.
>> ARTICLE
The World God Only Knows- such a honest and funny anime. I like it 
>> ARTICLE
Watched up to episode 9 of **Tokyo Ghoul**, I'm still waiting on the last uncensored volume to be subbed and then I'll finish. TG is probably my favorite manga (the fact that Kaneki was my first cosplay should make that obvious...), and while I still do like this adaptation, there's something that's missing in there. It does feel kind of rushed, and it's really obvious to me that they're leaving character development out. It's still solid, just not nearly as good as the source material.

My order from RightStuf came in early, so I also started watching **Baccano!** (6/16 so far). Holy crap, do I love this show. It's just so *different* to anything else that I've watched so far, and oh man, the *characters.* I mean, I only really know Jacuzzi and Isaac & Miria right now, but good god, everyone else just has such personality. 

[Side note: I can't recommend the dub enough. It's incredibly good.]

Finally, because I'm a weirdo who wants to have at least one anime that starts with each letter of the alphabet, I started **xxxHOLiC** (3/24). This is definitely an episodic show, with the quite literal 'monster of the week' format, but it's been quite fun so far. Also, Watanuki is such a dork, and I fall for dork characters harder than any other type of character. (Well, usually...Baccano has been an exception to that rule.)

EDIT: Finished Baccano in two days. Holy crap.
>> ARTICLE
**Ghost Hunt** - For something I just randomly decided to watch on Netflix one day I'm actually suprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's probably the first Horror anime that I found legitimately creepy. 

**(8/10)** - I wish that there was a second season but it's been so long that it's highly unlikely to get one. I'll just have to finish off the manga one of these days to see the end. 

**Hunter X Hunter 2011 (34/148)** - Wow I wish that I picked this up a long time ago. The story, characters, music, and animation are all great. I feel like the pacing so far is perfect, it doesn't blaze through events but it doesn't slog through anything either. Apparently it only gets better from here so I could easily see this making my favorites list in the end. 


**Serial Experiments Lain (7/13)** - I don't really understand everything that's going on but I love this show. This will definitely be something I rewatch in the future. 

**Moblie Suit Gundam 00 (5/50)** - I decided to take a break from the UC timeline for now. I like it so far the animation is pretty good and the characters are interesting. I'm interested to see where the plot goes from here.

Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S: 12/24
Loving the story so far, way better than I anticipated and I already really liked Railgun.

Hanamonogatari: Finally found time to finish it so I can catch up to Tsuki. Definitely not the strongest arc, but very enjoyable nonetheless. Gotta love Kanbaru.

Samurai Champloo: 11/26
As episodic as it might be, I've grown very fond of this series. The action sequences and animation style are really appealing. Been listening to more Nujabes because of it too, sooo good. :)
>> ARTICLE
**Hunter x Hunter 2011 (85 - 117/148)**



Ok this show started off great and has just kept improving, episode 116 was nothing short of a masterpiece and the chimera ants are a ridiculously interesting group of characters. 



>> ARTICLE
A few days ago I marathoned **Clannad** and **Clannad: After Story** for the first time. Bawled my eyes out, naturally. Really well-crafted story overall. Some arcs felt a bit meh, [like](/s "the gang fighting stuff"), but the majority of them served as necessary development, and were genuinely funny in places. The down-to-earth character development in AS was spot-on. I loved it - saddest thing I've ever watched.

Also, I just started the **Kara no Kyoukai** movies. I watched the Fate/Stay UBW adaptation and was stunned by Ufotable's production, so I went looking for more. Watched the first two movies already - very mysterious and intriguing. Seems you like you need to see all the pieces to get the most out of it.

**FLCL**

Last time I watched this I was in my early teens (around 2003-2004), so I thought it was ripe for a rewatch.  I was right.  I had no idea what went on the first time around, but I loved the flashy style and the robots and guitars and Vespas n'shit.  You know what?  It was pretty much exactly the same this time around, and I loved it.  Visual humor in its greatest form.

I did catch on to something more this time around though, like themes and references and such.  But I get a teeny tiny feeling that this is not meant as a piece to make you think a lot.  It's wacky, funny and random, and does its thing really well.  

Oh, and how satisfying is the sound when Haruko smacks one of those big ass robots with her Cord-started (wat?) electric guitar?

Oh, boy did I have a colourful week!  
Mars of Destruction:  
Ugh. That was shit. Boring and shit. Randm classical music pieces because the creators were too lazy to make an ost, 2nd worst animation I have witnessed, Characters...what characters? There were only didfferent hair colours...and I already forgot about those too! I dare say the story had potential but of course they f*cked up that too!The ars suit had this tron x samurai design which was the only bearable part of those 20 minutes. That's why it is a 1/10 for me.  
  
Skelter Heaven:  
The creators of MoD were at one point like "We wanted to make the worstanime ever with MoD but we don't think we did everything we could" so they made this clusterf*ck of shit and put it on a disc. Everthing is worse.Everything. I will have nightmares of that CGI...  
They even dared referencing Ghost in the Shell god damn it! They've got some nerve I'm telling you! 0/10  
  
Cowboy Bebop:  
Okay:**BEST.SOUNDTRACK.EVER**.The characters really grew on me though sometimes there was a little too much of Ed and why didn't Ein get a backstory?What drags this show down for me is the pacing. The main plot advances 3 times throughout the 26 eps though it feels finished so it's not that bad, but the filler between them is ranging in quality IMO. Maybe I was overhyped going in to this series, but I don't feel that this was the best anime ever. *bang* 8/10

**Bleach 12-18/366**

18 episodes in, we still have the same OP, but a different ED. Kinda weird. Speaking of sounds, *this OST* though. It's so cheesy, but yet so *fitting* for a show like this. Also, Soul Society when? ;_; **[Thank You!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H-_wBxV6ac)/10**

**Fairy Tail 78-89/175**

Really stupid arc featuring my least favorite [characters](http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpvkfi94kx1qb57hgo1_500.gif), but yet, I've kind of enjoyed these last couple of episodes, considered I lowkey hate it. **[ROCK CITY BOIIII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX3v651Ip8E)/10**

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood 9-22/64**

Second best OP, [aw yiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOsN2FP3-l4). Episode 22 is probably one of my favorite episodes from this series, everything was done so well, especially the music.  **10/10**

**Space Dandy (2/13)**

Just started today. I enjoy the occasional references and of course, Dandy.
Gotta love the narrator too.


**Golden Time (24/24)**

I really enjoyed this, in a way it's similar to Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso where it has its comedy moments and other times, the *feels* moments. I plan to pick up Nagi no Asukara soon as I've heard people said they were very similar.

I watched some more random movies and OVAs.

**Santa Company** - Pretty lackluster. I'm sure the people that supported it through Kickstarter were disappointed. What the hell was with the freaking laser guns? Such a weird choice. And whoever wrote the MAL description either fell asleep or watched a different film because that did not describe the movie I watched.

**Gundress** - A pretty boring mech movie from the 90's. The robot guard dog almost made it worth the watch, but not quite.

**The Day the Earth Moved** - Earthquake disaster film. Was hoping for something like Tokyo Magnitude, but alas, no such luck. Boring characters, boring plot, not worth the watch.

**Marco** - Best out of the 4. It's about a little Italian boy trying to reconnect with his mother in Argentina. Story's not that great, but there are some endearing characters to keep you interested.

**Aldnoah.Zero** (12/12)

Kind of forced my way through this show to see what the fuss was about. I don't think it was really a well praised show in this sub but It spawned a lot of memes here so I wanted to see why that was. Ultimately I found the story to be ok, nothing special. The CGI just looks terrible a lot of the time and mecha shows aren't typically my thing so I wasn't really pulled into the world. The MC is also the worst combination of Kirito and Kristen Stewart so [Aldnoah Zero EP12](/s "when Slaine shoots him down I could not give a fuck"), hell even at the end I didn't really get the whole 'fuck slaine' meme, [Aldnoah Zero EP12](/s "the worst thing he did was save the count but even then he couldn't have predicted him being able to shoot the princess even when he did, since his mech was busted up"). For the most part I only really got attched to the Princess and Slaine so this show as pretty underwhelming.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (20/64)

Been going through this with the rewatch threads, although for me this is the first time watching. If you've popped into those threads you might recognise the username. I've basically just spent every episode created crazy tinfoil theories and some of them have actually been right which is cool. I guess the thing I love most about this show is that it allows you to do that while still telling a consistent, intelligent and engaging story. I feel like each episode is deeply interconnected unlike *-ahem-* my experiences with other shounens. Not sure what kind of metal state I will be in by the finale unfortunately!

**Glasslip** (5/13)

Been pushing through this 1 episode at a time. It had possibly one of the worst first episodes of any anime I've seen. Literally nothing happened and I actually think I knew less about the characters after watching it than I did from the bio page. That said it has been picking up somewhat and I can actually believe this is group of friends now. The MC is still an unrelateable asshole and the other characters do not have very much depth to them so I can't really push this beyond a 4/10 at the minute.

**Bakemonogatari** (9/15)

Started watching this franchise because it gets talked about a lot in /r/anime. I didn't want to not know what people were talking about when it was brought up so I've gotten into it. So far I'm really liking it. It has a very cleverly disguised low budget and the rewatch ability is through the roof. It feels very artsy and I like things that get me to think beyond the surface level of what I am seeing. Looking forward to seeing how the subsequent series builds off of Bakemongatari.

> Glasslip (5/13)

WHY WOULD YOU EVEN DO THIS TO YOURSELF? You've been warned by so many people, yet you still decided to do it? I would reccomend that you drop because you ain't gonna get anything out of it.
>> ARTICLE
I know, I know, I only have myself to blame. Can't drop it though, dropping goes against every fibre of my being
>> ARTICLE
If you like FMA now, it only gets better.

And if you think Glasslip is bad now... May God have mercy on your soul, since you will get non from Glasslip.

**Tale of Memories**

I finished this after putting it off for a while. I knew nothing about it going in, and like halfway through the first episode I thought to myself, wow, this has a very similar feel to Bakemonogatari. And sure enough, SHAFT is the production company. 

All in all it was great and I liked it watching it, but when I look back at it, I'm sort of less enamored with it. 

**Tale of Melodies**

Started this one shortly after finishing Tale of Memories. 3 episodes in and it's pretty good. It's great seeing Chihiro and Renji again. 
>> ARTICLE
**Eden of the East** (1-11/11)

One of my personal favorites. The concept of having an immense amount of money (10 Billion Yen) and with the money, the changes that you can do within that world.

**Busou Renkin** (1-2/26)

Nostalgia at its finest! I remember reading the manga 10+ years ago. Finding out that there's an anime blew my mind. High School student saved by the power of an alchemic devices called the kakugane after receiving a deadly blow by a homunculus (antagonistic minions). Along with his savior Tokiko, Kazuki Muto uses his powers to fight the forces of evil. 


>> ARTICLE
**Tokyo Ghoul (5-12/12)**

The show had a bit less action in it than I was expecting, but I still had a good time watching it. Looking forward to seeing what happens in A.

**Fairy Tail (123-125/175)**

Not much Fairy Tail this week. A couple of plot related episodes, and filler. I'm expecting the next arc to actually start in an episode or two.

**NouCome (1-10/10)**

Hilarious show. I was laughing harder than I've laughed at a show in a long, long time. It was a really nice change of pace from all of the action-y shows I've been watching lately. Would definitely recommend.

**Death Billiards**

I watched this in anticipation of Death Parade, and it was a lot better than I expected it to be. I would suggest watching this if you are on the fence about Death Parade.

**Dragonball Z Movies 1 & 2: Dead Zone and The World's Strongest**

Both movies were a bit dated, but still an enjoyable watch for a DBZ fan.
>> ARTICLE
**Welcome to the NHK (1-24/24)**

I've been saving this one for a while. I knew I would like it going into it, but even so I was impressed at how enjoyable I found it. It was very well directed and I love the artsy ways they conveyed Sato's paranoia. I was expecting more feels and for the work to be more depressing in general, but I enjoyed the way it turned out. I found the relationship between Sato and Misaki to be very well done and I was really happy with the way the series ended.
>> ARTICLE
I binge watched the entirety of Bakuman. I followed the manga weekly from its 4th chapter on, but never saw the anime. The anime had higher hype moments, but it missed out on some of the side character development and like an entire arc. Still was really enjoyable.

Also, I've been watching the second season of Hamatora, and it's been pretty par for the course so far. Seems like a really similar concept to the first season. Still great animation and cool minimums, but I don't feel that into it.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the entirety of **Pet Girl of Sakurasou** this week.  Massive spoilers.

I don't really know how to feel about this show.  Mashiro  is a weird character because she's presented as the main girl, but i feel like due to her lack of dialogue and lack of character development she really feels more like a static side character.  Everything we learn about her is really just someone telling the MC something about her.  She gets very light plot relevant dialogue until the last few episodes.  In the final confession, i feel as though this was the first time that she actually participated in a meaningful conversation.  I feel like more of her screen-time is spent doing fanservice / ecchi than anything else.

I'm always disappointed when the "plot device" girl wins over significantly better character(s) (like in Nagi no Asukara) and it also feels a bit fake and predetermined.  I also feel cheated when the "i love you, so i think you should confess to the other girl" trope comes up.

  Nanami had better character development and was a much more 3 dimensional character.  And with all the chemistry that Nanami and Kouhai had, and the general lack of chemistry that Mashiro and the MC had, the end choice is really disappointing.  

This is one of the times where I feel like the choice of the girl actually changes how I rate the show.  Overall I thought that the show was above average but lacked closure / satisfaction in the main romantic plot.

**[WataMote]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/16742/Watashi_ga_Motenai_no_wa_Dou_Kangaetemo_Omaera_ga_Warui!)** (12/12): Oh dear, I just picked a random show off my PTW and I don't know if it was one of my better decisions. It was so incredibly cringeworthy, my fault knowing that since it _is_ labelled a cringe comedy. Everything that Tomoko gets involved in I couldn't help but bear myself for any form of following embarrassment. But I wouldn't lie that I teared up when she got hugged by the Student Council President during the school festival. 7.5/10

**[Ping Pong the Animation]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_The_Animation)** (11/11):  Regretfully, I had put this series on hold _while_ it was airing at episode 5, and only decided until this week to finish it up. My lord, this show was good; with all of the self discovery that happened to the characters I couldn't help but to feel really happy when the series ended. It was so resolute and "finished" that I felt like any other ending wouldn't have done it justice. 9/10.

**[Spice and Wolf]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou)** (26/26): I **LOVED** this show, why did I leave this unwatched for so long? The banter between Lawrence and Holo were next level, and I fell in love with Holo (she honestly deserves that best girl award, even though I loved Makise...). Now, if only there were season 3 to conclude that story, because that giant u is going to bug me forever. (9.9/10 give s3 for 10)

I already read the manga, but I finally got down to watching [Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood). I would say that the manga has more charm and handles the comedy better, but that godlike madhouse animation certainly makes the rest of the show interesting to watch. I'd say it is an adaptation that does justice to the manga, and worthy of a 10/10 rating. I can finally add FMA:B to my top 10 anime at number 2.

Edit: I just found out that FMA:B was made by Bones, not Madhouse. My life is a lie.

Marathoned Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope) yesterday. Phenomenal music and the show was just a pleasure to watch all around. 9/10 from me 
>> ARTICLE
Watched **Girls und Panzer** over the past few evenings.

Great show once I got over the art style which I didn't really like. It's kind of a generic sports anime but it takes its absolutely ridiculous setting seriously which makes it great and unique again. The characters are a tad bit too tropey but they serve the purpose. The pacing suffers from the show only being 12 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching Monster. Good stuff. 
>> ARTICLE
**Hajime no Ippo** 
Usually I'm not a huge fan of sports anime but something about this show really grabbed me. The characters are a ton of fun and surprisingly fleshed out,  the fights are intense, and you really feel as if Ippo is progressing and learning with every fight. So far I'm really enjoying and recommend it to anyone with even marginal interest in Boxing or the show in general. I'm only about 20 or so episodes in and from what I've heard it only gets better.

**Monster (1-9/74)**

I like what I've seen so far. This seems to be a very critically acclaimed anime so I can't wait to see where the story goes.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of stuff but Yahari ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru was fucking amazing. I laughed my ass off, especially since I could very much relate with the main character. I've actually taken up reading the source material because I just need more. And the 2nd season should be coming in a few months too!
>> ARTICLE
**Sketchbook: Full Color's**

From the same company that brought us the incredible Aria series, this was yet another simple and easy SOL from Hal Film Makers. It wasn't anything major or significant or excessively amazing. It was just a tale about a silly airheaded girl that carries a sketchbook everywhere she goes. Her daily life, her friends in the art club, and a bunch of cats is all this anime ever really wants. And, just like a pocket fan on a hot day, [it was just enough to help.](http://i.imgur.com/fhNDX4m.gifv)

If you want something deep and meaningful, this is not an anime for you. Yet if you want something light and fluffy to help ease yourself through a day or two, this'll do.

Score: 8/10  
Recommendation level: What is your color?

**Sasameki Koto**

I was first cued into this one due to it being mentioned in the same breath as Aoi Hana. Yet, in practice, it has as much relation to Aoi Hana as Sakurasou has to White Album 2. 

Let me explain.

Sasameki Koto starts off as a pleasant drama, full of potential and and sweet romance. And then it shifts focus dramatically at the start of the fourth episode, becoming almost a generic romcom in tone (albeit still a *shoujo-ai* romcom) with all the traditional tropes implied. 

Yet the problem with Sasameki Koto wasn't the shift in tone from romdram to romcom. Instead, [definitive spoilers](/s "the problems came from the functional lack of romance. Ushio and Sumi were wonderful together, but they just never went to the next level to put the rom- in romcom.") And, most frustrating of all, it fell prey to the "make an anime only to boost manga sales" trap. It was never designed to give us anime watchers a resolution or a final satisfaction to send us off with a good feeling about everything. 

It was still pleasant for what it did. Sure, there were a few embarrassing and awkward moments scattered about. Yet they by themselves didn't drag Sasameki Koto down as much as that ambiguous ending.

Score: 7/10  
Recommendation level: If you like shoujo-ai titles, you'll still like this one.  

On-deck: Space Battleship Yamato 2199

Mirai Nikki. I dropped it the last time I watched it because I figured it was going to have some generic lame ending. I was pretty wrong about that. Overall it was a decent show, not something I will likely ever watch again though. Yuno was 100% the star of the show, and was what made it worth picking it back up.

Hello all!  [I'm always late to these things](http://i.imgur.com/A3vDoIJ.gif).  But I like writing for the 3 people that read the bottom of the barrel here.  Ya'll are cool people. This week I watched:

**Diebuster (6/6)**

  Watched Gunbuster the week before, so I figured I'd just watch the rest of the show since I thought Gunbuster was pretty friggin cool.  This show is Gainax at it's Gainax-y-est (it's a word now, deal with it). Everything from the awesome [Gainax pose](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/014/525/icon.jpg) to the rediculously awesome fights with [giant ass robot lasers](http://33.media.tumblr.com/ea508abadd58cad8374614bb3a81667b/tumblr_n82s9iPMtj1rwvdy0o1_r1_400.gif)(**<-----that gif's a spoiler**) and sooooo  much more.  I had a great time watching it and I'm sure that most people will too.

Thumbs up from me! Watch Gunbuster first! 

**Rakuen Tsuihou: Expelled From Paradise (Movie)**

Hmm.  Well, I watched this on a whim after reading where [this song](http://youtu.be/XUuvTRBwdy0) was from.  Seeing as how I'm a rabid Gen Urobuchi fanboy and I was considering dying of embarrassment over the fact that I didn't know a new movie of his was out, I watched it.

It was altogether pretty meh.  I guess I would summarize it like this:

Music: A

Animation: C (Toei hasn't really done anything note-worthy in the animation department...except Mononoke...my mind was blown when I read they did that.)

Story: B(ish)

Character design: B(ish) [This guy](http://myanimeshelf.com/upload/dynamic/2013-10/02/Dingo_12.jpg) was super cool, but everyone else was basically made to sell figurines.  I mean [c'mon Gen](http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/9d1d00a1ad7fe0ee91cdb3cfa449a6341395428745_full.jpg) what are ya doin.

Summary: Urobuchi fan? Watch away!  Not a Urobuchi fan? Well are you okay with a slightly awful-looking movie with a pretty interesting sci-fi concept.  Go for it! There's a character in the show that reminds me of [Wall-E](http://monstersfilmandlit.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/wall-e-wallpaper-wall-e-6412244-1280-10241.jpg).  Not convinced? It's probably not for you; you're not missing out on much.

**Kara no Kyoukai 7: Satsujin Kousatsu (Movie)**

A muuuuuch better movie than the last thing I saw.  Awesome fights, superbly animated, and it's all dark urban fantasy (read exactly the kind of thing that gets me hyped to watch or read things).  I was super impressed with the show and really impressed with the ending and the fighting and the and the and the and the...

If you haven't seen the series, start it when you have the time! Most will say movie 5 and 7 are the best. Annnnd here's a guide to the series if you're lost. [List of movies! Don't watch the remix!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kara_no_Ky%C5%8Dkai_films)

[Also here's a book series for you if you like this kind of show.] (http://www.jim-butcher.com/books/dresden) It's great!  

That's all for this week!  Thanks for reading and....

**Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita** **(1-9/12)**

This show is hilarious.  The social commentary is pretty clever, and Watashi is a great MC.

**Abunai Sisters** **(10/10)**

Now this was an interesting watch.  10/10 best 30 minutes of my life

**Black Lagoon** **(12/12)**

After putting this series off for a long time, I finally decided to watch it.  It was good, but I didn't like the episodic feel of it.  I heard the second season remedies that, so I'll keep on watching.

**FMA:B**  **(28-56/64)**

I screwed up again.  I wanted to watch with the rewatch group, but I got carried away again.  By the way Golden Time Lover is a sick OP.

**Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei** **(1-3/12)**

I really like this series so far.  Itoshiki is really funny, and the ED is catchy.

I'm 2 episodes into Space Dandy, damn the show is really good. I laughed quite a bit and the art is  fantastic. I really enjoy Watanabe's work so I'm looking forward to see where this goes. 

"Names Dandy, but you can call me Space Dandy, Baby."

The first episode of Dandy is one of my favorite first episodes in any show ever. So much 4th wall breaking and the way they set up the universe is just so genius.

IMO the second season is even better than the first, so you have a lot to look forward to.

I'm also 2 episodes into Space Dandy, started today. I enjoy the occasional references and of course, Dandy.

Gotta love the narrator too.

Gintama - After a long day of work, I like watching shows that just make me laugh without making me think too hard. Nichijou fulfilled this purpose to a great degree and Gintama is as well :)

Just one anime:

* The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: 7-28/28 (chronological) | I had thought it similar to Chuunibyou at first, but the show quickly diverged after the first arch [given](/s "the MO of everyone but Haruhi was to prevent Haruhi from remaking the world...") Can't decide whether it should earn an 8 or 9/10... [That said,](/s "*Endless Eight*. That should have been 3 episodes, not 8 of them. *Maybe* four, at a stretch. Of course, you really empathize with Yuki to much greater extent after just the eight episodes...")

Plan to watch film today.

Edit: Watched film. 10/10. 'nuff said.
>> ARTICLE
Please do tell what you think about the movie later!
>> ARTICLE
Okay, that plot. Was not what I expected.

I am completely okay with this.

Excellent. Just excellent. That's a 10/10. Especially the soliloquy at about 2 hours. [Makes up](/s "for the Eight in so many ways. And the reuse of the time travel was an excellent decision").

The premise (only 50m in) is actually fairly similar to the Chainfire trilogy in Sword of Truth. It's interesting.

I'm about halfway through Log Horizon S1, and it's pretty neat. I find myself comparing it to SAO sometimes, and I like how Shiroe actually has a personality and is interesting compared to Kirito. Also, the opening is really good and I never skip it. I hope that if there's a second opening, it can match up to it.
>> ARTICLE
I did the same earlier this week when I lost internet for a couple of days (and the power was intermittent, gotta love winter storms). I found it better in so many ways. The characters are better, the story writing is better, the setting is better (I love how they explain *and adhere to* the game mechanics).
>> ARTICLE
> I find myself comparing it to SAO sometimes

While both are based around people trapped in a game like world, I feel that the two shows are completely different.  Even you if you only compare the base game mechanics, they're different.  While in SAO there's a tense because people are trying to get out of the game and avoid dying by monsters, in Log Horizon the Adventurers are actually trying to explore their world.  Plus there's no fear of dying in Log Horizion.  

> I hope that if there's a second opening, it can match up to it.

No need to worry, Database is kept as the OP for the second season.

> No need to worry, Database is kept as the OP for the second season.

That's what I call "play it safe".
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you have a point. I'm just thinking about how halfway through Log Horizon I see no signs of a harem (though I hear there is one) and halfway through SAO  S1 he's had girls all over him despite the tense atmosphere and everyone trying to get out, and while you could just pass it off as desperation because "we could totally die here" we all know that's not the case. I appreciate how Log Horizon is prioritizing its plot and isn't making a pseudo-harem as an excuse to explain different mechanics of its world.

YES, I'M STILL LIVING IN THE DATABASE.

Also, the part with Shiroe and Henrietta dancing was kind of cute.
>> ARTICLE
Probably not very well-know...at least here. [Aoi Bungaku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7193/Aoi_Bungaku_Series). I really liked the idea of the show...there are basicaly 6 important Japanese pieces of literature made into anime. At the beginig of every episode the host explain some backgroung of the next novel/book or the author (these are not in anime form but real-life TV set up, then anime begins). I didn't read any of mentioned works so I can't say how accurate they were but it still provided nice insight into Japanese literature and culture.
>> ARTICLE
I saw it a few months ago and I wasn't a fan of the first story/ first 4 episodes. But I adored everything else. The changes in art styles between stories was really good.
>> ARTICLE
It's been on my list for about a year now, but I never got around it...and I really should.
>> ARTICLE
You definitely should! The great thing here is that since it is 6 separate stories in only 12 episodes you can watch one story, get to something else and come back to another story anytime you want. You don't need to get to the setting again or remember previous episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Started **White Album 2**, finished 2 episodes. So far not impressed, the dialogue is unrealistic and the romance is too cliche. I'll finish the series because so many people seem to like it though.

Edit: Just finished episode 3 and this show is really starting to get on my nerves. The characters and their dialogue are so poorly written, so unbelievable that it's making me regret spending any time with this show. The plot so far comes off as a male chauvinist fantasy. It's been a long time I've felt this kind of disgust towards any anime I watched.
>> ARTICLE
**Hanasaku Iroha**, good slice of life with great art. 

**Darker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini**, dissapointing sequel. Not much else to say.

**Black Lagoon (seasons 1 & 2)**, that's one badass show. [Season 2 also had some hilarious engrish](http://i.imgur.com/HSicf2c.png).

* [**Code Geass Season 2**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2904/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch_R2) - The re-watch continues as I'm enjoying the reactions of my friend and his shock at all the twists and turns. Currently at episode 13.
* [**Oda Nobuna no Yabou**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11933/Oda_Nobuna_no_Yabou/) - **Re-Watched** - I've been wanting to either rewatch this or read the LN lately. After trying to decide what to do with this series and 10 others, I ended up relaxing by rewatching the anime. The first time I watched this series was while it was airing without truly immersing myself. I've come back to this series cause it's a good one. I really enjoyed this re-watch and I look forward to starting from the beginning again this time with the LN. (I'll read the LN in a month or so probably.) Back onto topic though, I really love the protagonist and how forward he is. While he can be a little stubborn like Nobuna, his ability to follow through makes up for it. Kind of wish he were a bit more aggressive though with Nobuna. She tends to be a dere the majority of the time but he doesn't push it. The one thing that bothered me were [Katsuie's](http://myanimelist.net/character/59899/Katsuie_Shibata) breast plate jiggling. I mean, I get fanservice and all, Nobuna makes for some great fanservice, but when metal starts to jiggle with breasts, that's a little annoying.

Continued with [**Monogatari Second Season**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17074/Monogatari_Series:_Second_Season) (20/26). Felt kind of unsatisfied with the Nadeko arc, [Monogatari spoilers](/s "thought the kind of got the shaft, so to speak") Just wrapped up the second Hachikuji arc and [](/s "cried my fucking eyes out").

Almost done with [**Kodomo No Jikan**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2403/Kodomo_no_Jikan_\(TV\)) (10/12). Enjoying the series enough to pick up the manga and really glad that I did. The show's done a good job of adapting it but in light of the source material has felt a little clumsy at times. 
>> ARTICLE
> Felt kind of unsatisfied with the Nadeko arc

You should watch the last arc then.  It involves Nadeko, and Kaiki comes back.
>> ARTICLE
neat. yeah, I figured she'd be back at some point, my willingness to marathon this series is a little low though, so i'm just making myself suffer.
>> ARTICLE
**Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, and Nekomonogatari: Kuro.** Really enjoying the series, I'm a little disappointed I didn't pick it up sooner. I watched the first episode months ago but it didn't catch my interest. Halfway through the second episode last week and I was hooked.

**No Game No Life.** Why didn't I watch this sooner? I loved every minute. I can't wait for more. Please let there be more? I might have to try the light novels.

**Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!. [(Listen to Me, Girls. I Am Your Father!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11179/Papa_no_Iukoto_wo_Kikinasai!)** Almost finished this. I was hoping for something like Usagi Drop, and was not expecting as much perverted humour. still good IMO.

**Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo. [(Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They?)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo)** Five episodes in and also enjoying it. Was a bit taken aback by the direct threats of rape and sexual enslavement from this type of show. I don't think I've seen an anime bring that up so casually.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

While it isn't exactly on topic, I also read some light novels.

**Absolute Duo** - I'm about a quarter through volume four. It's surprisingly enjoyable even if it is generic. I like the interactions between Thor (or Tooru) and Julie, almost like a father and daughter, but also with Julie acting like a mother at time comforting Tooru.

**High School DxD** - I finished volume 3. I want to get ahead of the anime before it airs next season. As I've already seen this arc in anime form, there isn't much to say. It's amazing how perverted things get when they are written down, like discussing his desire to suck on "buchou's oppai".

>Either way my current aim is Buchous oppai. With Buchous oppai, Im going to.  
>[You are going to grope it?]  
>No, Im going to suck it!

>The sensation of Buchous oppai I can still feel it within my hands. If I get another chance I want to grope it for a whole day! Even Buchou might give it to me as a treat for her servant. But thats not enough! Guys have to aim higher! Guys who become satisfied with groping oppai are second rate lechers! Thats why Im going to suck her oppai!

**Hyouka** - I watched Hyouka the week before last and really enjoyed it. I want more, so I'm reading the light novels. I've only read the first so far. Unfortunately it appears the light novel translations haven't passed the anime.

**Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry [(A Chivalry of the Failed Knight)](http://myanimelist.net/manga/70061/Rakudai_Kishi_no_Cavalry)** - Read volumes one and two, which is as far as has been translated. Another generic light novel set in an academy that trains high schools to fight. Almost identical to Absolute Duo. It starts with this line which is almost exactly the same: 

> Blazers. They were irregular, one-in-a-thousand existences, people who could each materialize his or her soul as a weapon called a Device.

Just replace Blazers with Exceed, Device with Blaze, and even 1-in-1000 is the same.

>Exceed  
>Refers to those who were given the biological enhancement nanomachine called Lucifer which was made by the organization called Dawn Institute several years ago.  
>By injecting it to those who had the Adapt (one in every one-thousand people), they would be able to attain a body which surpasses the limits of a human, and also due to their enhanced mentality, they would also attain the ability to manifest their Soul into the weapon called Blaze.

There really are a lot of light novels that follow the exact same formula.

NGNL will get a second season once the source gets far enough. It definitely had the popularity and the sales for it, and with the LN still ongoing there is still a profit to be had in making it.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't that big on Hanekawa through Bake and Nise, but the I really, really liked what they did with her character in Kuro. I hope you're excited for nekomonogatari: shiro!
>> ARTICLE
For NGNL: While I hope for there a second season, it won't be anytime soon if any. The ending of the anime is different then the volume 3 ending of the LN. Else, there isn't enough source material for a second season(Volume 4-5 is one arc, Volume 6 is a side-story). But I would definitly adivse reading volume 4-5, as the arc shown in those two is better then the previous arcs.

> I watched the first episode months ago but it didn't catch my interest

Same here.  I didn't really get what was going on, and the pacing was really slow.  I put it off for 3 months, but then I really enjoyed Bakemonogatari once I finished the first arc.

Baby Steps. Along with Cross Game, it's one of the better sports shows I've watched, and a second season coming in April.

**Data A live (6/12)** Started this on a whim, and it's so fucking ridiculous. But, I just so happen to love ridicoulous. Let me express it in a YuGiOh TAS joke:


Kotori: But Shido, there are others! These are the AST, the JGSDF's Anti Spirit Team.

Shido: Why are they young girls?

Kotori: What?

Shido: I mean they're super soilders, right? Why are they young girls?

Kotori: Why would you choose to focus on that?

Shido: And for that matter, aren't you supposed to be the Commander? Why are you a young girl?

Kotori: Shido, stop activating the anime logic card and listen! 

Also **Outlaw Star (20/26)** Good for all that loved Bebop and want more.

**Finished Durarara!! and Specials (17-24/24) (2/2)**

I think it was definitely worth it to get caught up on Durarara!! to followi along with the second season. I actually enjoyed most, if not all characters in the show, and seeing their interactions was really a treat. Celty and Shinra make best couple.

**Finished Baccano! Specials (3/3)**

I wasn't even aware these existed till somebody pointed them out to me a couple of days back, so I sat down and finished it off. I will say that it did provide some degree of finality, but the sudden inclusion of a new character kinda threw me off. In addition, I was lost about some of the characters because I have shit memory and they relied completely on remembering most, if not all details from the TV series.

**Watched some 'Short Peace' ('Farewell to Arms' and 'Possessions')**

Short Peace is basically an experiment in CGI. The ones that I saw looked pretty cool. I think Farewell to arms looked damn great, even it made very little sense after the middle portion. Possesions had a unique look to it, which I really enjoyed, in addition to having a nice little story.

Watched mainly airing shows.
>> ARTICLE
I finished Durarara!! about a week before it started airing, and It has made its way into my top ten. I am a huge fan of character driven shows, and Durarara is just genius. The way it manages to have so many (15 I think) different characters, and give them all decent development, and manages to carve each character out their own little piece of the central narrative. I am a huge fan of when an episode will go back and tell a story from a previous episode from the perspective of another character. I also love the anime references from Walker and Erika as well as the Baccano! references. Anyway, this rant was a tad bit longer than I expected, Haven't really had a chance to gush about how much I loved this show. And by the way, my favorite character was Shizuo.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain durarara to me. I tried reading the summary but didn't get it. So is it just multiple stories from different viewpoints? Help would be appreciated.
>> ARTICLE
Mainly 1 storyline with different perspectives. Of course there are divergences, but it all interweaves. You might be a bit confused going into it (first couple of episodes), but it starts to clear up more as you go.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the heads up.
>> ARTICLE
So basically, the story follows the "main" character Mikado Ryuugamine, who who moves to Tokyo's Ikebukuro neighborhood. Ikebukuro is famous for its color gangs, (gangs that identify themselves by wearing a specific color) A gang called the dollars that have no color, and other supernatural events such as the fabled "Black Rider" a mysterious motorcycle rider that rides around with no headlights on a bike that makes no engine noises.


That is basically what you should be able to gather from the first couple episodes, The opening sequence does a great job of familiarizing you with all the characters, so I would not recommend skipping it. So yes the main characters are Mikado and his friends, but the story isin't afraid to throw a bunch of other characters around, and give you their perspective. The one thing I really praise this show for is its ability to develop all these characters enough where you can see them in a scene and know a bit about their backstory, and character motivations. Granted some of these characters get less screen time than others, they all seem fleshed out enough so that none of them seem to be forgotten. And yes this show does have an overarching narrative, the plot takes a little while to get going, but the show never seemed slow or boring in the least bit. Once again, ive typed a long winded response, my bottom line is that if you decide to give it a shot, you will not be disappointed. The second season just started as well, so There is no better time to give this show a watch! P.S. Let me know if you end up watching/liking it.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the reply. The concept has intrigued me, and I plan to watch it after oreimo. See you in the season 2  discussions.
>> ARTICLE
I feel you. I liked the show for a lot of the same reasons you did. On a COMPLETE tangent, Thanks for letting me steal your cover art code. Mine wasn't working for the longest time. I would have to say that shizuo is pretty cool, but I liked Shinra the best...

Heh no problem!

Nisekoi 18/20 Needleess to say, and to spark a battle, I'm an Onodera and Marika fan so this last episode really just made me mad. So mad that I stopped the episode for a while. I love the series and I'm probably going to pick up the Manga before S2. It's really how /r/anime described it.
>> ARTICLE
**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** **(36-41/64)**

Really loving the series. The writing, fight scenes, animation, just top notch. I'm also liking where the story's heading.

**Durarara!!** **(24/24 with specials 12.5 and 25)**

Realized the first episode of season 2 got released last Saturday so I decided to binge through Durarara S1 this week. I think I just found a lock for #2 in my top 5 favorite anime. I just really liked how the episodes were structured (i.e. Pulp Fiction). 

I also found out that Shizuo Heiwajima is so goddamn cool. His voice from the sub and dub are pretty amazing (Crispin Freeman with his half Alucard, half Kyon voice, and Daisuke Ono, who did Sensei Handa's voice in Barakamon)

Watched it half subbed and half dubbed. Both on par with each other, with an ensemble cast in each version. My only complaint for the dub was that Mikado's voice sounded "too wimpy", but that's just me.

**Gintama** **(50-52/265)**

Gintama always makes me smile.

I also watched **Episode 7** of **Psycho-Pass** and **Episode 2** of **Oregairu** but I barely remember any of it since I watched them with a huge headache.

>> ARTICLE
Log Horizon S1 : I thought that this was pretty enjoyable.  Good world building and a decent cast. Much better than SAO, in my opinion.

Nichijou : I tried to watch this, but can't bring myself to go any further. The humor tries too hard, and doesn't do it for me.

Abenobashi : Halfway through this one, and I'm not exactly sure what to make of it.  Reminds me a little of FLCL

I just finished Haikyuu!. The show is great and I love every single one of the characters. Solid 9/10 and I'm not even into volleyball or sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari second season all of it and boy the last 6 episode were fantastic. Best story arc of all time fight me if you disagree 
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree, Koimonogatari was easily the best arc in the series.

For me it really showed how much better Monogatari can be when they call back to previous arcs and give it an overarching story, despite arguments being made that the story doesn't matter since the show is all about dialogue.

It's too bad the quality of the arcs tend to vary a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah they do but that story arc was brilliant and I put that story arc up against any other story arc ever 
>> ARTICLE
The individual arc was pretty great, but looking at the show as a whole I can't help, but feel disappointed due to the other arcs that don't live up to it.

**Hyouka (3/22)** Just started watching it today and I'm enjoying it so far. The visuals are great, characters and plot looks interesting.

**Hataraku Maou-sama! (13/13)** Felt like rewatching this for the fourth time now. Even though this is the fourth time i watch this the jokes are still funny, the characters are great and the story is as good as ever. I hope news for a second season comes soon.

**Haganai Season 1 and 2** Last episode remains, one word = amazing. My friend kept saying it's not good and kept postponing it, Thank God I have watched it, I have never laughed like this since Devil is a part timer. 

**Barakamon** Fucking Amazing, one of the best slice of life I have watched, Loved everything about it. 

**Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru** ep 1-5, I will finish it today and tomorrow, so far it's good.

**To love ru Darkness and the OVA** Best ecchi and fan service I have ever seen even better animation than hentai. 

**Hellsing Ultimate** Ep 8-10 Well No need to comment about how awesome this was.

**Motto love Ru** Better than Season 1, but still an average anime filled with fan service and pantsu shots. 

Damn all these in 1 week ....... according to MAL's History 

>> ARTICLE
**Neon Genesis Evangelion** + **End of Evangelion** - It's been on my to watch list for forever and a day and I needed to watch it for the longest time. Good show even if the first half is kinda slow and not much more than a standard mecha show but once it gets going it really goes places. Perhaps the best thing I enjoyed about it were how human the characters were and how realistic Shinji was as a character and despite this being made in 1995 it was so refreshing to see a main male teenage lead where the girls aren't jumping on his dick, calling him out of his bullshit, and his trauma and issues portrayed rather well. The ending for the tv series was hilarious while End of starts off with [](/s "masturbating over your comatose coworker's body") and keeps upping the WTF levels

About the worst thing besides the slowness of the first half or so is the fact that it is kinda old looking. Though End of is rather well animated and still looks good.

**Kara no Kyoukai Movies 1-3** - As a Type Moon fan I needed to see this sooner or later. Fantastic Ufotable animation as always, and it feels like Yuki Kajiura's strongest soundtrack I've listed to yet (though I'd be happy to be proven wrong, I haven't listened to everything she's put out). It's interesting, has a very cool lead, and the non linear storytelling I can get behind. Movie 3 felt a little weak to the other two, while Movie 2 was fantastic.

**I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying** - I'm normally not a fan of most romantic comedies but since this starred adults in a preestablished relationship (not something you see everyday in anime) short and I could blaze through it in a half hour I tried it out. It's pretty funny, cute, though a few jokes fell flat, it's nice to see a loving stable couple where the lady is also the working one while the husband stays at home.

**Oregairu (Ep. 1-6)**

In anticipation for the second season coming out in Spring, I finally decided to pick this show up. From what I've seen so far I'm really enjoying it! Hachiman is much more relatable than other MCs of these kinds of shows. Also Saika is best [ ](/s "trap").Most likely gonna finish up the show today.

Psycho-Pass (ep10) and Binbougami ga! (ep1).

I'm currently watching Cardcaptor Sakura, already at episode 50, so-called second season, and I've to say I liked the first half (45 episodes) much more. But still the show's interesting and keep the intrigue, I'm glad I decided to remember my childhood and watch it completely, great mahou-shoujo.

**Kuroko no Basket** season 1

I really enjoy sports anime, and this was no exception. The one gripe I have, is that the show mostly centers around Kagami and not the titular character. I am happy that there is a 3rd season broadcasting now though, so I am looking forward to that.

**Gintama**

Everybody loves some Gintama. The blend between comedy and some action scenes here and there is great. At around episode 213, so still got some ways to go.

Did ya watch StrikerS too?

**Nisemonogatari**:  This part of the monogatari series sealed the deal as one of my favorite series. Karen Bee part at first wasnt the best but it was great overall but the ending of it felt a little lack luster. I enjoyed every second of Tuskihi Phoenix I felt like it had everything that make monogatari, the monogatari series.  

**Nekomonogatari: Kuro**: This was pretty intresting as a prequel to Bakemonogatari and i didnt know what to expect except for [Bakemonogatari and Nekomongatari: Kuro Spoilers](/s "Shinbou saving Araragi") since Araragi was talking to Hanekawa about this near the end of bakemonogatari. Also i didnt expect Araragi to get rekted in the middle of the story which helped keep me on my toes. Also some of the Tuskihi face were pretty scary when the story started.

**Fairy Tail**: FINALLY FINISHED. but the grand magic games was a good arc overall expect it was started to get pretty fan servicey with the aqua battle and Mira and Jenny's battle. Ofc the Duo battles were great and awesome esp Ichiya and Bunny's. unexpected as hell Men. Prob wont start the 2014 series for a while.

**K-on!!**: As always cute and fun with them as they always seem to have fun. K-on!! holds a special place in my heart.

**Log Horizon**: Finally getting around to this and im enjoying it. the characters feel really cool and Akatsuki is just too damn cute. Shiroe is a pretty laid back dude that knows a lot about the game (similar to kirito but i wont bring up SAO stuff).  

**Tokyo Ghoul**: Only watched the first episode but the anime seems like it will be crazy as hell with what happened to the MC.

**Gintama**: watched 3 episode of it and it funny as hell. Gintoki not giving any fuck half the time is the norm in Edo.

**Death Note**: I tried watched ep 27 but its seems like the animation quality went down imo and there's too many bright colors compared to the episodes before this one I think its alright but still shouldve stopped before this.

So this week i planing on finishing  Toyko Ghoul K-on!! and Log Horizon this week so i can get onto some of my other anime that i really want to watch.

I watched **Death Note** this week too. I enjoyed the mangas a lot back in 2006-2007 and put off watching the show because of how fresh everything was in my mind.

**Spice and Wolf** 

I rewatch this show this time every year hoping the Gods will bring out a third season. but what can i say i love the show, its one of those shows where you can just sit back and relax and just chillout in one sitting.

**GTO**

Been watching this for the past 2 days. Eikichi Onizuka has became my all time Favorite MC he is just the biggest Badass in media  *Big Call I know* but he is. Like people say Kamina is the biggest badass in anime but has [TTGL and Gto Spoilers](/s "Kamina Escaped death? no Onizuka has countless times and for the sake of his Students. like come-on the guy got shot 3 times and still finished a School test to see if his worthy enough of being a teacher all in one day and passed with a perfect score. You can't be anymore badass than that")

**My Teen Romantic Comedy Snafu**

The show was quite enjoyable the characters were fun. *You dont fuck around with the 8man* the ending though felt a bit meh i was hoping for a proper conclusion with an incident that happened with the main cast, but hey thats why a second season is coming.

**Naruto The Last: The Movie** since its a movie.

Not gonna lie i enjoyed it. it was a good conclusion for a series that ive been watching since i was 7. The animation was absolutely beautiful, the opening scene was fucking great, the fighting choreography was smooth. and the story for the movie was perfect. the Character development wow i was impressed, to see in a whole on how much they've changed i loved it. So yeah if you're a Naruto fan or not I recommend it. Its one Studio Pierrots best work in animation by far.

[Donten ni Warau](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=15780): what I thought was a simple shonen plot turned into this crazy layered thing that never stops for 12 episodes.  I'm thoroughly enjoying it.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Deadman Wonderland. It's a pretty standard plot that doesn't allow for much character development. Towards the middle it gets pretty flat. However, towards the end it gets a lot better. The new characters introduced later on inject some life into the show and the ending wraps everything up well. It's only a single season (12 episodes plus an OVA that isn't necessary) and is on Netflix, I recommend it for a binge watch.

Rating: 7.5/10

**Psycho-Pass**

 3rd time watching.

 First time seeing the dub.

 I was iffy about the dub from seeing the trailers, but watching it in it's entirety I now feel like they did a pretty good job on it. I still think Makishima's dub voice was the best of them all though.

 I'm way too hyped for that damn movie now.

>> ARTICLE
I personally didn't like the first 8 episodes of AS that much. I wouldn't say that they're bad, but I don't think that they're as good as the rest of the show, especially not as good as After Story. Clannad is still my favourite show, but if I had to mention a problem with it this would be it.

Anyways, have fun, you're in for a ride~

The World God Only Knows. Aside from all the in-jokes I happen to honestly like the various characters. 

Other than that, I haven't been watching much anime, but I am obsessed with watching back episodes of You Ha Nanishi Nippon e?

**K-On!! (16-21/26)**

I finished the first season awhile ago, and though I could see the appeal, I thought it was pretty meh overall. Watched the first half of the second season, which had its moments and was definitely stronger in my eyes, but still didn't really change my opinion.   

This week, however, I got into the second half and was pleasantly surprised. The characters seemed more charming and full of life, while their various personalities played off each other very well. This was helped along by a great attention to detail, especially in things like facial expressions and gestures. I think the show really started to come into its own at this point as a strong representative for the SOL genre and not just cute girls doing cute things. Perhaps it was always this way and it's just now clicking with me, but either way I definitely think the show has begun to perfect its formula. It was truly enjoyable to watch the characters and their interactions with each other, and I found the humor to be resonating with me a lot more, as well.

I think this was all solidified by the more touching and emotional events this season, such as Yui's lyric-writing, the play, and their last school festival concert. These moments really captured and displayed each of their unique flairs and the different relationships they shared amongst each other.

**Akame ga Kill! (8/24)**

So far not too impressed. I'll stick with it, but I don't have the motivation to watch more than an episode or two at a time. It's just very... average. None of the deaths have really touched me, and this is coming from someone who cried during parts of Naruto. The one aspect that stands out to me is its take on or attitude towards death and killing, which has prompted at least some thought.

**D-Frag (12/12) + OVA**

Comedies that overuse the straight man tend to annoy me and become stale quick, but I actually found D-Frag's MC (as the straight man) to be hilarious. The show was quite funny and often self-aware. Quite solid for a pure comedy show.

**Barakamon (12/12) + Mijikamon**

Not much needs to be said about the show that hasn't already been said many times. Naru and Sensei's interactions were a joy to watch, and both of their VA's performed exceptionally. Very funny and very pleasant. Easy to see why it was a standout title of 2014.

**White Album 2 (12/12)**

Strong story and characters that were very human and well-developed, complemented by beautiful and often touching music. It's nice to see a romance where a love triangle is handled in such a mature fashion and a lead male actually showing more personality than a potato for once. It was  definitely hard to watch at points as I could really feel the pain of the characters, but surprisingly, I was quite satisfied with the ending. If I had any real complaints, it would be that the animation was nothing amazing and, like most romances, all other male characters were left in the dust (which the show even admits to).

**Noir (16/26)**

After a really slow start it has started to pick up in pace around episode 13. It's at the point where the mystery isn't much of cock-tease any more and it's delved into less episodic assassinations. Don't like Chloe. God damned ninjas in France my arse.

**Clannad: After Story**

All other shows suddenly feel meaningless...

**Bakemongatari**

A harem but with brilliant dialogue and visuals, plus almost no fanservice. Fantastic.

**Inou-Battle**

Another harem thats genuinely good. Some very funny moments and one awe inspiring monologue. Currently praying for season two.

**Welcome to the NHK!**

Unlike any other show I've seen. Surprisingly funny considering the subject matter, although I was annoyed with [spoiler](/s "how long it took Sato to except that he needed help.") Haven't finished yet, but plan to.

**Steins;Gate**

I really didn't care for the first half of this show but once the second half started it was absolutely amazing. [spoiler] (/s "After finishing the show it seems it'd be really fun to rewatch the first half and see all the little bits of foreshadowing.")

**Anohana**

I went into this show completely blind except knowing that it'll make you cry. It did that 10x over. Episode 11 is Clannad AS level sad and I didn't expect that going into this show. It's one of my favorite animes now and it leaves that I don't want to do anything feeling you get after completing a really good anime.

**Bakemonogatari 1-8**

The Monogatari series is highly regarded around here so I wanted to give it try. I'm not very far into it but I'm not really caring for it which is a little disappointing. I keep hearing about how episode 12 makes you cry so I'll stick with it until then and if I don't care for by that point I probably won't watch the rest of the series.

Perverts, screechy girl, overly dramatic asshole, it has it all. It is slowly getting better, but I'm not even that interested in the story. Probably because most of the characters are so unlikable. Thankfully, the best thing that could have happened to the story just happened (removal of a certain theme), and it'll be a lot more tolerable from here on.

**Gunbuster**

The best robot series Gainax ever made that's not called Neon Genesis Evangelion! Watching this made me wanna look at 20th century anime, there's just so much love in those series.

**Galaxy Angel**

Still watching it, but it's really funny!

**Mobile Police Patlabor: The OVA Series**

I got so attached to the characters it made me sad when the OVA series ended T_T

**New Dominion: Tank Police**

It's amazing! But too short!

Started Death Note yesterday, two episodes in so far. I'm liking the premise of Light basically becoming a god and what I assume to be a descent into madness. Also, I'm interested to see what L will do to counter his killing spree.

This past week, but not currently airing... Let's see. 

From most recent to oldest in past week:

**Psycho Pass 2** (currently watching ep 8. Should be done later tonight)

**Dramatical Murder**
Anime is utter quality shit. My. Eyes. Had to wash them with the VN.

**Antique Bakery**
A very unique style. (unfortunately) the first yaoi I've ever watched that is not created for the purpose of fanservice and pretty boys...

**Bakemonogatari**
Thought I would like it since I'm a huge Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei fan, but I have to say as much as everything is good the slow pace of every episode bugs me. Also, it looks like the fast-paced still images just want to hide the fact that they don't want to make us watch animations, but more like a diaporamas. But it's really unique.

**Persona 4 The Golden Animation**
Goddammit.

I only just started watching [Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11843/Danshi_Koukousei_no_Nichijou) on recommendation from one of my mates.


Only seen the first episode, but it seems pretty damn awesome. Lost my shiz in [this skit.](https://thenullset.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/winter2012314471.jpg)

**Durarara episode 18-24**

It has taken me several weeks to finish this show, as I would watch a few episodes and then not touch it for a week. Apparently, I have bad luck because this time, I managed to stop watching right before the drama is unleashed and [Durarara spoilers episode 20ish](/s "we find out that each kid in the trio is the leader of the gang.") Thus commenced me binging 10 something episodes in a single night. 

It really is a great show, the first season showcasing all the characters by making seemingly unimportant events all connected in ways  that you otherwise wouldn't expect. And then you have the second half of the show showcasing the characters' potential. Besides an overall slow start, this was a great show, and I am now on the hypetrain with season 2. 9/10
>> ARTICLE
**Love Live!** and **K-On!** (only through the 1st season). Both are amazing. Listening to some K-On songs on Youtube, atm. Good stuff.

Just began the railgun/index series (starting with railgun) and I think it's already my new favorite show

Working!! and Working'!!, it was a nice, fun SoL and I enjoyed the workplace setting.

Just started **Seitokai no Ichizon**.

Just finished **Hataraku Maou-sama!** which was fun and engaging.
>> ARTICLE
**Kill la Kill (10/24)**. So I went into this show thinking, yeah, I haven't yet gotten around to watching this so I might as well do it now. I was prepared for it to be over the top and entertaining but not this addictive! (note that the 10 episodes were in one day, a lot for me) Really enjoying it so far.

**The Wind Rises (Kaze Tachinu) (Movie)**. Again, another fantastic Ghibli film. Really nice film.
>> ARTICLE
Quite a lot actually. 

Finished off Afro Samurai, which managed to be a really chill anime while still showcasing lots of action, which I really liked.

Finished off the Saiyan saga for DBK. Not much I can really say, but how they finally took Vegeta out of the fight was pretty bs tbh.

Started and finished Trinity Seven. As someone who's watched a lot of ecchi/harems, this show was a breath of fresh air. The character wasn't a complete fucking moron. It was beautiful. And I liked damn near all the girls, which considering by the end was nearly a dozen is a pretty good feat.

Finished the week off with eps 2-6 of Free! which I originally started as part of a deal. The only reason I'm sticking with it is because of my refusal to drop an anime.

Now onto next week, which will hopefully see the end of Free!
>> ARTICLE
**Monster (30/74)**  
I'm really liking this show now. It is still incredibly slow paced, but it's been so long since I could look back on nearly every episode of a show and say that it was definitely a good episode. Johan is already one of the creepiest characters I've seen in anime.

**Shikabane Hime: Kuro (8/12)**  
This season is quite a step up from the previous one. The story is more focused, and the dynamics of the world have been better explained. The character development also feels more consequential than last season. The biggest problem is that there are still too many characters to flesh out properly in such a small span of time.
>> ARTICLE
**A certain Scientific Railgun (10-18)**
It's actually really funny show. I watched the first Index a few weeks before, and it was totally diffrent. While the two series share some characters, and the universe and certain facts, the Index is more focused on the story, and the Railgun, while telling some story, has way more comedy elements. I recommend both of them, even though I haven't finished Railgun yet.

**Dragon Ball Z (98-113)**
Yeah, the DBZ we all know so well...
I finished (probably) one of the longest fight in the series, now im bred by the fillers, but I'll manage somehow. Still though, DB wins in every aspect for me ;D

And that would be all for this week. Was kinda busy ;D

the first season of Tokyo Ghoul

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren (Completed)** - I enjoyed it as much as the first season, which is a lot. The characters are still as fun as ever, the conflicts are handled well, and I felt it took the next logical step after Season One. It did go down a more antic-heavy route this time, though. If you wanted a boatload of character development, you may feel disappointed. Honestly, I'd be fine with a Season Three, but that's just me.

**Barakamon (7/12)** - So far it's been great. It's heartwarming, funny, interesting, and relatable. I'm gonna finish it up soon.

**Naruto Shippuden (Season 3-4) Rewatch**
Well I've seen every episode, but since a couple of weeks ago I watch a video of the OP6 and OP7 I wanted to watch that part again. So I started re watching the whole anime. So far very disappointed in Naruto, but Naruto Shippuden is really good. A lot of action and no fillers so far. Although I know the huge amount of fillers starts around season 8 or 9.

**Samurai Champloo (1-11)**
So far the anime is pretty good. I'll finish it this week.

Catch up with last season anime:

**Sora no Method (1-12)**
Kinda slow but good. I would go with a 6/10 rating.

**Girl Friend BETA (12)**
Mmm not so sure about this one, was kinda dull but not bad, maybe 5/10. 

**The Fruit of Grisaia (13)**
This one was really good. Good thing next season are coming up. Also need to learn Japanese to play the LN.
>> ARTICLE
**Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (11-16/25)**
Finally it seems that the deeper, more serious story is starting. That one episode where [spoiler](/s "the guy with the eye patch cut up all those people then proceeded to kill the girl INSIDE of Al was pretty messed up and dark. It was also a cool revelation that he was one of the homunculus'.") Overall I'm still enjoying it. Liking the new darker tone that its taking on. Art, sound, VA, etc is still good as well. **8/10**

**Kowarekake no Orgel OVA (1/1)**
Nice and relaxing story but also borderline boring. Pretty average OVA. Flower was your average moe loli. MC had "some" depth but also pretty average. Soundtrack was okay as well. In total, everything was average **6/10**
>> ARTICLE
Digimon Adventure 1. Gotta prepare myself for Adventure Tri.
>> ARTICLE
**Psycho-Pass**: It's a pretty good anime, though season one was slightly better than season two. The show has good characters all around. Protagonists are likable though they do leave the development of some of them in the dust. Subplots are interesting. The main character is both wrong and has beliefs to the point of being faults which is always refreshing.

The first antagonist is usually praised. He deserves it, though I feel like he could be pretty cliche at times. Yet his good far outshined his bad. The second antagonist is better than what you see in most animes, though the characterization of the first still outshines him. 

**Isshuukan Friends**: I'm about four episodes in and the anime is pretty light-hearted. Lots of smiles thus far. I'm not usually into light-hearted cutesy smiley animes but I needed to detox after binging on Psycho-Pass the days I had the late shift. All that seriousness and darkness can't be good for the soul.

**Susei No Gargantia**: The characters are all pretty likable. You really have no idea where the anime is going next half the time. It's good. Not super amazing but at least an 8/10, would buy the DVD.

Legend of legendary heroes. 24/24
Rewatched this and again left hole in my chest. Saddens me that this didn't get another season.. it had so much more to give!
Liked overall the serie but it gets kinda confusing in the end. And kinda overused the emoing too if you ask me.. or then it just felt like that because i watched this in 2 days. 7/10

**Magi: The labyrinth of magic & kingdom of magic**

It is a great shounen with very interesting support chars. It gets better after every episode, and it features one of the best villains I have ever seen, Judal. 8/10

**Toradora**

I had it on hold for months since i am not very much into slice of life anime. Still on episode 6 and damn, it is hilarious, i hadn't laugh so much since Full Metal Panic. 9/10

And I am probably rewatching Zetsuen no Tempest soon, since I can't find an action drama good enough until 2nd season of UBW.

HunterXHunter. I started on it about a week ago, and I'm currently 35ish episodes in. Man, that show is a blast, did not expect to enjoy it this much

I started watching rurouni kenshin again. Its been a couple of uears since I watched it :)
>> ARTICLE
I've been slowly catching up on my backlog. I watched Ghost Hound and From Up On Poppy Hill. 

Ghost Hound was all right, but I got lost somewhere in the last four episodes and will have to watch them again. 

From Up On Poppy Hill had me nervous because I was afraid that they were going to come down with a case of the Lannisters. I liked the scenery and background cast, though - especially the Philosophy Club guy. Unfortunately, I couldn't quite figure out what the "plot" of the movie was actually supposed to be since it was pretty scattered. Still, it was better than Goro's first film.
>> ARTICLE
**Bakemonogatari** (2/15)

This is probably gonna piss /r/anime off, but I'll be honest, I'm really underwhelmed by Bakemonogatari after all the praise I've heard for it. It's not bad or anything, it's just not grabbing me in any way. I can't put my finger on why, but the dialogue feels empty, like it's just there for characters to say stuff and nothing more. And the fanservice. Good god is the fanservice annoying. Fanservice doesn't bother me, but Bakemonogatari's just seems totally overdone and unnecessary. To give the show credit though, the visuals are outstanding, and the soundtrack is pretty solid too. Bakemonogatari really shines in the art style and camerawork department. I'll give it a couple more episodes to see if it grows on me, but my first impressions of it are that it's bland and average.
>> ARTICLE
It tends to grow on people as time passes, but I have to agree with you having watched the [entire series](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2su39g/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cnsvq1n) myself during this week.

The dialogue itself is very pretentious and the information that is actually important is spoon fed to you so there isn't much more to be said about it.

It's not a bad show though, but it really must be underwhelming after all the hype it gets.
>> ARTICLE
Katekyo Hitman Reborn 34-91/203 - Im hooked on this series. Great characters, fights, comedy and plot. Really enjoying it so far

Gintama 68-71/201 - Didn't watch that much but the robot maid arc was pretty cool. The rocky scene was too funny

**JoJo's Bizarre Adventures (20/26)**

All I can really say is "Daayuuum". This is just so good. The art, the animation, the music (especially the OP and ED) and it's so damn manly.

I'm already excited for the sequel.

**Mobile Suit Gundam EP 1-21**

Kickstarting my New years resolution of completing the Universal Calendar continuity of the Gundam franchise. So far it's been pretty amazing, so much so that I question why I didn't start watching it sooner. 


The art has aged very well in my opinion considering its age, both the OP and ED are amazing. The characters are rather well done in opinion, the "bad guys" aren't puppy-kicking nazis and the good guys also come off as assholes occassionally.

After finishing this I'll probably start LoGH, to continue my space opera binge.

**Hidamari Sketch x   EP 1-5**

In between the serious stuff you need to space it out with something relaxing. And boy is this show relaxing, the visuals have become even more polished and looks more like what we today know as shaft. This show isn't much but it is very relaxing.

**Revolutionary Girl Utena EP 18-23**

I have to say, I don't fully see the hubbub around the show. I'm probably not reading deep enough into it as I often don't. I can sort of see where the praise is coming from but not that much.

I'm a bit too distracted by the visuals which are not to my liking and their use of old shoujo tropes (I am aware that it is deconstructing them, but it's still rather off putting to me). 

I do enjoy the fact that the characters have been increasingly fleshed out recently. I'll hold my final decision until I've finished. Also my friends tell me it only gets better after a rewatch, so we'll see about that.

**Zetsuen no Tempest EP 1-3**

I dropped this show the second I finished the third episode, even making through the second episode was a chore.

The world seemed uninspired, the dialogues were not very good to put it gently, and the characters themselves are dull.
>> ARTICLE
We have the same new years resolution! I'm just starting ZZ myself though since it was really just to finish UC after I had already started it last year. You took the hard road by watching MSG series instead of the movies like me though. There is a rewatch going on right now of MSG movies and then Zeta afterward I think so maybe you will align with that.
>> ARTICLE
**[Honey and Clover II](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1142/Hachimitsu_to_Clover_II) (1-12/12)**  
6/10. I wasn't a huge fan of the first season but I thought it was only fair to finish it before I go around telling people about it. I didn't really get into this second season either, but I admit I did get emotional at the ending. On the whole, however, I just didn't feel like the show was cohesive. It was a bunch of dramatic things happening but I never felt a resolution with most of them, it just continued to jump around and no one was very clear about their feelings. Maybe that makes it more realistic but at least for me it didn't make it more watchable.

**[The Tatami Galaxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei) (1-11/11)**  
8/10. I was looking to watch something a bit different from what I usually go for and this was definitely the right choice. Really unique, and I loved Akashi-san's character. The last two episodes were really cool! Certainly a respectable show, would recommend it.

**[The World God Only Knows](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8525/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai) (1-12/12)**  
7/10. This was real enjoyable, a good mix of comedy and some cheesy romantic moments. I loved the last arc with Kana Hanazawa as Shiori, adorable. I may watch season 2 eventually!

**[Katanagatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6594/Katanagatari) (1-12/12)**  
9/10. Damn, what a show. It was intense at times and endearing at others. I liked the action but most of all I liked the emotion in the show. Episode 12 was truly a spectacle. I'd honestly just recommend this to anyone, just an amazing series.

**[Koe de Oshigoto!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8876/Koe_de_Oshigoto!_The_Animation) (1-2/2)**  
6.5/10. Wanted to watch something that would give me a boner and make me laugh, this did the job pretty well. A high schooler tries out eroge voice acting. It's only an hour in total so check it out, but watch out for some explicit scenes and general cheesiness.

**[Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou) (4-13/13)**  
6.5/13. I didn't really find too many parts of this show that compelling. My favorite part was when [](/s "Lawrence found out he was bankrupt") because there was some drama and we saw some feelings. I guess that's what I like in shows, and this show was generally more reserved. Respectable, just not for me I think.

Neat, overall a productive winter break in terms of anime watching!
>> ARTICLE
**Hentai Ouji**

Good comedy, but wasted potential.

The first episodes really felt like something else, the story slowly falls apart and loses its consistency by the end of the show.

I'd still recommend it for pure entertainment if nothing else.

**Bakemonogatari**, **Nisemonogatari**, **Nekomonogatari : Kuro** **Monogatari : Second Season**, **Hanamonogatari** and **Tsukimonogatari**.

It's okay, but the disconnect between individuals arcs causes a large fluctuation in the quality of its individual arcs, this becomes apparent when  I noted that my favorite arcs were the ones that had real significance storywise and called back on previous arcs. This fact really reinforces my conviction that even though having a story isn't the point of this show it's a lot better when it does, all arcs that I have enjoyed had a drive behind them.

The non-linear storytelling works decently for the most part, but in some arcs like Onimonogatari it really ruins the tension due to how previous episodes already spoiled the outcome, the journey to a known destination has its merits regardless. Some moments of comedic relief that were really out of place also ruined the tension in some scenes.

The dialogue isn't very consistent in terms of quality I feel, it ranges from being amazing to really dull, this is another factor in the quality of the individuals arcs.

The symbolism in this show is really 'in your face' for the most part, all the important information like the significance behind each of the aberrations are spoon fed to the viewer. Other deeper meanings behind the dialogue feel very pretentious, shows like Utena and Penguindrum do that a lot better IMO.

I like this series and I want to see more from it, but I don't think its as good as its made out to be. It does everything, but it didn't excel at anything for me. Even the dialogue, which I feel was much better in Spice & Wolf.

**Katanagatari**

I'm currently watching it, thoroughly enjoying it, so far I have no issues with it. And even though its early to say this I already like it a lot more than the Monogatari series.
>> ARTICLE
**Baccano!** - Finished - **9/10**

What a great show! 1930s America + mafia + alchemy + bit of comedy? Fuck yeah! And I'm still amazed how well they pulled off the time jumping. 

**Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de** - Finished - **7/10**

It was entertaining. Animation, art, characters were all great. The plot was pretty basic, but worked well. Up until they tried to explain the magic. Wow, that was retarded. [Inou-Battle spoilers](/s "Seriously? You spend like 7 episodes completely ignoring where did the magic came from and then you tell us fucking fairies were bored so they give powers to humans to wacth them fight?")

**Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya** - Seen 3 eps - **On-Hold**

I can't seem to get into this, even though I'm still somewhat interested. Similar case to Madoka Magicka, which I also dropped, though after 1 episode. I plan to get back to this soon.

**Hataraku Maou-sama!** - Seen 4 eps - **Watching**

Interesting plot. Nice characters. And it's pretty funny at times. I didn't expect much from this, but so far it's pretty good!
>> ARTICLE
For Fate/Kaleid: That show is a bit strange, I agree. If you don't enjoy the humor, you won't like it. However, you dropped madoka Magica at the point where you more ore less aren't allowed to drop yet :p You have to watch at least up to episode 3, as thats when the show gets serious(which is from where lots of it's praise comes from)
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I'm going back to Madoka Magica for sure. I know I dropped it too early, but I really didn't like the first episode. And I wasn't at the time willing to watch something where I'm not hooked from the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
If you enjoyed Baccano you'll probably like Durarara as well, since it's from the same writer. Also the second season just started 2 weeks ago, so it's one more reason to pick it up.
>> ARTICLE
I have marathoned NGE with End of Evangelion. I kind of want to say that watching it just to see Asuka fucking up those EVAs was worth it, but then I remember all that Illuminati and vagina looking at me from ultra megazord jesus Reis forehead.

Are 1.11, 2.22 and 3.33 better than the original series? Or is it just another pile of mindfuckery and whining Shinji?
>> ARTICLE
the first one is a pretty straight remake. the second one differs much further. and I haven't seen the third but apparently it goes off the rails. it's basically a completely different story. if you felt the series was visually lacking then you'll enjoy them, they've got that big big budget. 
>> ARTICLE
Shinji is less whiny in the rebuilds but IMO the original series is still significantly better.  
>> ARTICLE
I've recently watched all of eva can't say if the rebuilds  movies but 3.0 is the worst  soon many problems
>> ARTICLE
So I am better off leaving it as it is and trying to forget that last 5 or so episodes ever happened.
>> ARTICLE
Um nooo? The 1st and 2nd movies are good they follow the show while doing their own thing, but in 3.0 they just throw everything out the window and stop following the show. Which is cool the idea was cool but then the execution is done really poorly with simple problems that could have been solved if they just talk to shnji. I don't know if this was the answer you where looking for (probably not) 
>> ARTICLE
I guess that some stuff just got lost in translation. I will take some time off since have pretty large backlog and check out the movies later.
>> ARTICLE
I watched two episodes of Elfen Lied and I can't get into the anime. It's a little too bloody for someone like me who has occasionally watched real beheading videos. The nudity is also off-putting.

I watched an episode of Black Cat too, I'm going to watch a few more episodes to make up my mind of watching the whole anime.

If I don't get into Black Cat, I'm watching Samurai Chaploo.

I'd love some suggestions of what animes to watch. I like themes of horror, mech, adventure, sci fi, and psychological thriller.

Knights of Sidonia pretty much combines everything you are asking for.

**White Album(1-13)**

The search for a good romance anime continues, since White Album 2 did not do it for me. I understand the characters and why things played out the way that they did, but that doesn't mean I didn't find it forced and cheesy as hell. During the big climactic moment in the [WA2](/s "airport") I straight up started laughing. Maybe the impact of this one was dulled for me because I couldn't give even the slightest care for [WA2](/s "Setsuna, especially with how little screentime she was given towards the end"). I do like the song though.

Didn't really love or hate this one, but it was disappointing. **6/10**
>> ARTICLE
I just started WA2 a few days ago and I'm on episode 4 right now. I don't even want to continue with this show if the laughable writing/story that I've seen so far continues for the next 10 episodes. 

Also, if you're really looking hard for a good romance, you should put [Nana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/877/Nana) at the top of your list. Nothing else even comes close.
>> ARTICLE
If you have a low tolerance for melodrama like I do then you probably won't enjoy it very much. It pretty much just takes the extremely overused "characters never effectively communicate" route to stir things up.

Nana is on my plan to watch and I'm sure I'll get around to it someday.
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf is a great show and if you're tired of high school students it will be a very refreshing change too.

The main focus isn't the romance, but the adventure. Despite that fact, it was more satisfying than shows where romance is the main focus.
>> ARTICLE
I've actually had S&W on my comp for awhile now and just need to get around to watching it. Now that I think about it pretty much all of my favorite romances in anime come from shows where romance isn't the main focus so i'll probably like S&W.
>> ARTICLE
**Watamote**:

I didn't understand the appeal of SoL until I found the right slice. What a great show, hilarious and heartbreaking both at any given moment. I've heard that people find this show mean-spirited; I guess it is if you laugh without understanding what it's like to live with Tomoko's social anxiety and other neuroses. If you do understand, it's painful but cathartic. 

In summary: best girl? Tomoko. Awkward? 'Fo life. Peace out. 
>> ARTICLE
See I also watched this show this week and I found it mean spirited in a different way. Tomoko isn't just socially awkward, she's not a very good person. She is constantly shit talking in her head and lying. She's a jerk. I hated her! The only endearing moments for me were when she was actually being nice to Yui-chan and felt nostalgically towards her friendship with her brother.
>> ARTICLE
Well, she's a kid and loners are immature by their nature. Maturity is a social adaptation. Tomoko wants to be popular and popular kids are mean; that is an empirically-established fact for her. She calls everyone bitches and sluts because she envies them. Furthermore, she's insane. When you are afraid of who you are, you can't help but develop an adversarial attitude towards the world. 

Yeah, sometimes she's a jerk and a brat to the extent that we stop empathizing with her. Often it's her mother or Tomoki we're supposed to sympathize with, though (usually right before they lay the smack down on Tomoko, too). *Watamote* doesn't gloss over the fact that it's a pain in the ass to live with someone who is severely neurotic. 

I don't know. Maybe you just have to be as warped as she is to like her. 
>> ARTICLE
I missed the last couple of weeks, so this might be long.

**Code Geass (44-50/50):** This show was an exciting ride from the first episode to the last. It may have had its bumps in between, but it never strayed too far from the plot. Every episode had you craving for more and only doubled once the second season came in. Lelouch, hands down, became one of my favorite characters and this show became one of the best mecha series Ive ever seen. With one of the most satisfying endings. Im glad I picked this up. **9/10** 

**Psycho-Pass (1-22/22):** I was introducing my friend to anime and this show was something on netflix that looked interesting. I'd never seen the show and thought, why not? I'm glad I did that. The dub was fantastic and the soundtrack was really good. Especially the OPs and EDs. What made the show so interesting, was the fact that you were given the rules of this society. Then watch, how easily it could tear down and all the flaws of it. Also, Makashima didn't feel like your average antagonist. He had a point to his actions and overall became a really enjoyable character. Hands down, this is my favorite Urobuchi project and I can't wait for the second season in October. **10/10**

This past week:
 
**Monogatari Series: Second Season (1-10/26):** I put this show on hold for a while now, but with Hanamanagatari already coming out. I knew what I had to watch next. This season is looking pretty good, so far, with the first two arcs being really enjoyable. 

**Dead Leaves (1/1):** This entire movie was insane. With action, gore and crude humor in pretty much every scene. The story was confusing and when you thought they would find out what happened to them. The TV guy would make a joke and then the next enemy would start attacking.This movie was lacking in story and felt like it was made by someone with ADHD. Because it was made by [Hiroyuki Imaishi](http://myanimelist.net/people/2349/Imaishi_Hiroyuki). The guy who would later on direct Kill la Kill, PaSwG, and TTGL. And I could really see a lot of future ideas that would make it into these shows. But I still gotta give this a **6/10** 
>> ARTICLE
Just out of curiosity, what made you give 9/10 to Geass as opposed to 10/10 for Psycho-Pass?
>> ARTICLE
To me CG had some characters that were really lacking. I didn't like the amount of people that had a geass in the second season. Plus, I didn't like the [coincidental problems](/s "Like when Lelouch's geass reached its full strength right after coming to an agreement with Euphemia.") Overall the show was really good and I enjoyed almost every episode. 

As for Psycho-Pass, I really liked the atmosphere of the show. It was cool to see how the sibyl system worked and then seeing [it](/s "crumble down and reveal that it was controlled by people who were just like Makashima. And once that happened, there wasn't a sense of whether Makashima was wrong for trying to take it down.") The show had its flaws too, but overall I enjoyed it more.
>> ARTICLE
I missed the last few weeks so I'll comment on whatever I've watched recently.


**Kuroko no Basket (32/50)** Started watching this show after the weekly Haikyuu hype and I'm enjoying it a lot. Great train ride anime but I still rate Haikyuu over KnB. I just feel a lot more connected with Karasuno than Seirin.


**White Album 2 (6/13)** Was looking for a drama to watch and was deciding whether I should watch WA2 or Sakurasou but went with WA2 due to the fact that it was shorter and a friend just finished it and recommended it. So far so good. Definitely what I was looking for to scratch my drama itch and from what I've heard it should be a tear jerker too. Looking forward to that.


**Haganai (24/24)** Watched this one a few weeks ago as I was looking for some ecchi. I *think* I liked this one but couldn't tell for some reason. I enjoyed it but couldn't help but feel hardly anything happened after all those episodes. Still fun^andRikabestgirl.
>> ARTICLE
Haganai is ecchi? I honestly didn't notice. Hmm, maybe it needs a rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
I liked WA2, its a pretty solid drama.  The second half gets really good.
>> ARTICLE
WA2 is certainely good and will also most certainly get your drama fix taken care of, but afterwords you are going to need something to watch that is atleast mostly light hearted, and that is where Sakurasou comes in. It certainly has its down points, but this will be a good show to pick you up after WA2

**Neon Genesis Evangelion** (Episode 1-14)

Currently binge watching it. I gotta say, I read a lot about NGE in this sub-reddit and how the MC was very annoying and such. His reaction was actually pretty realistic, it's not like the other anime MC's where they go "Oh, we're gonna fight a giant fucking humanoid, LET ME AT HIM!". He's actually thinking it through and he's just a teenager for fucks sake. And Ikari's Father is best father of the Decade. 


**Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou** (Finished)

This is actually the funniest anime I have ever seen. I loved the "Book Girl" skit the most, second is probably when Ringo-chan first visited the Seitokai. Man, I still giggle every time I think about those scenes.
>> ARTICLE
My only complaint about Evangelion is that my favorite character isn't introduced until episode 24.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely a terrible idea for teenagers to pilot giant robots.
>> ARTICLE
Do you believe the dream theory?
>> ARTICLE
I was actually very confused. My take on it is that they're making fun of endings in anime that have clearly ended but the writers thought that the ending should be about "starting a new journey". That's just my view on it though, the dream theory makes sense but the theory is overused and It ain't explaining anything.
>> ARTICLE
it explains that ringo doesn't exist.
>> ARTICLE
Tadakuni and Ringo both showed up in a skit though. So it's invalid.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I'm not going to tell you to *stop* binge watching NGE, i'm just going to say that it's generally recommended to watch it a few episodes a day when you're first watching it. Especially later in the series.

NGE is probably my favourite anime series of all time. Even the Rebuilds. (Yes, even the second and third one.) I'm glad you don't fall for the "Shinji sucks!" bandwagon, he's a really well thought out and realistic character. 

Once you get to ending and you have that, "WTF DID I JUST WATCH?!" moment, feel free to message me and I can share some of my ideas about it.

*ninjaedit: shameless /r/evangelion plug.
>> ARTICLE
It's too late to stop now, but thanks for the advice. And I'll be sure to message you if I get confused or just need to talk.
>> ARTICLE
Oh. Also watch End of Evangelion. It's the "canon" episode 25 and 26... and its one of the best things ever. 
>> ARTICLE
That's how i always felt about Shinji. People like to give him a bad rap, but I'd much rather see characters like him than characters like Luffy.
>> ARTICLE
I think I need my "Luffys" of the world, to make me also appreciate the more subdued realistic MCs.  I think i would get bored if they were all realistic though, its one of the reasons I love anime :/
>> ARTICLE
its bad rep btw :D

we all know shinji is a [good rapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D9ycE38S2o)
>> ARTICLE
For the record it is bad rap, or bum rap depending on where you come from.  It's a pretty common expression.  To the point that it's in the [dictionary](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bad+rap)
>> ARTICLE
hmm, it says it has to be unjustified or wrong in the definition tho. Welp, language changes.

Soon we'll be accepting would of/should of *shudder*
>> ARTICLE
I would be lying if I said I wasn't annoyed at him at first, but you'll slowly grow on him and understand his circumstances. I mean, I bet people are gonna say "It's anime bro, they don't have to be realistic.", but does it hurt to have some realism for once?
>> ARTICLE
Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is the funniest anime I've ever watch. I've watched it like 5 times and still laugh out loud every time.

**Usagi Drop episodes 7-11 (Complete) + Specials 1-2/4:**

Watched with /u/animeclub, actually made it through, on time! Notes for episodes [7-9](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2fa856/anime_club_watch_23_usagi_drop_79_spoilers/ck7ea3h), and [10-11](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2fh9s7/anime_club_watch_23_usagi_drop_1011_final_spoilers/ck9uizj).

Overall, it's a good show. It's amazing how much actually happens in each episode, when you break it down you can see how even though it's usually about one "issue", you could've filled 2-3 episodes with the content, but none of it feels rushed. Here's what I wrote about episode 11, as summary:

This was a good show. Well, the question asked sort of summarizes the journey thus far, and discusses the journey ahead - "What about my hobbies, what about my alone time?" - Well, you still have "Your time" while you're with others. It's not that you're giving yourself up to be with someone else, but that being with someone else is the "thing that makes me happy, which I'm looking forward to doing," it's not something you give have to give other stuff in order to do, but what you give other stuff because this is what you most want to do.

As Daikichi said a couple of episodes ago, he's growing up here as well. This isn't merely Rin's journey, from the back of the funeral service to the front of the memorial service, and this isn't Daikichi's journey to raising Rin, but a combination of both.

Families are about repeating patterns, Kazumi looks at Rin, sees the future, and isn't sure she wants it. But she doesn't have to, but it's showing us the decision Daikichi made, which he needed explained to him, is one you grow into, rather than one to be understood from without. And in manners of families, and generations, it's not special, others go through the same sort of stuff.

Good show, made me smile, though it could've delivered slightly more pain and bittersweet moments, I enjoyed what was there :) 8/10

The specials are actually good, even though nothing is "frenetic" in the rest of the show, the specials actually show us Daikichi sitting and looking at Rin, and sometimes 10 seconds pass without anyone moving, and they're oh-so-sweet.

**Ouran High School Host Club episodes 1-14:**

I wanted to watch something, and it's always better to pick something new up rather than catch up on all the shows I'm in the middle of, and had been since last *December*, and actually like and would like to finish, right? Well, that's what I did anyway.

I like Haruhi a lot. I wonder how the show differs for me compared to girls or homosexual men, in terms of the mental shipping/crushes. It's sort of obvious that it's Haruhi x Tamaki, right? But I mean, when you prefer men, do you feel like, "I wish we saw more of [X Male character]"? And slowly grow fonder of them as we see more of them? Most of them are one-note characters, in this show, with Tamaki being one-and-a-half-notes, so I wonder. But I did grow to like Haruhi considerably more as the episodes went by.

I chuckled a number of times, I found some of the ideas quite amusing and clever. The show this show reminds me the most of, in some weird way, and also perhaps related to the premise and the art-style is the first season of Hayate no Gotoku, which I've put on indefinite hold at episode 44 at around 2009. Hayate had slightly more ""character-focused time"", but I feel the way we actually interact with the characters and the humor is better-served by having half the episode-count, as everything feels much tighter.

Tamaki and the rest are like people straight out of The Red Pill in how they act, if not what they believe, they're children, and the show knows it. [Episode 9 had feminazis, literally](http://imgur.com/VAAGb8Z). And they weren't the opposite of the Ouran host club, but their mirror image. I think you could get a *lot* out of this show if you wanted to discuss social and gender roles, but while I muse on some of them in the back of my mind, I avoid turning my thoughts to it consciously for the time being, and rather focus on the characters, and their stated goals.

No, you can't take them too seriously, because the show doesn't either. And stuff. Oh yeah, Mikorin from Nozaki-kun? He's based on Tamaki, if he didn't blush after every such sentence he uttered ;)

It does grow on me, the characters, and their relationships, as the episodes go by.

You should watch the manga for Usagi drop, I hear it's pretty good. ^^^^^^^^^^Kappa

**Shin Sekai Yori** (first 9 episodes in)

I've heard good things about this show.  I like scifi stuff so i knew i would be pretty interested going in.  Its pretty slow so far, which isn't bad but i don't find myself really getting excited to watch it.  The art is kinda inconsistent but sometimes looks very good.  I don't really feel connected to any of the characters since Satoru pretty much did a full 180 on his character, and i have no idea what Saki is thinking anymore after the time skip.  The other 3 characters don't really have personalities.  Not too bad, hopefully it picks up steam soon.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU** (5 episodes in)

I like this show.  I really empathize with Hachiman and every episode keeps me interested.  Every time, i'm always surprised that its already been 20 minutes and the episode is over.  I haven't heard that much about this show outside of people talking about Hachiman's character, so i don't know what to expect from the rest of this, but i'm excited to watch more.  I like slice of life for the most part, so this seems like a good choice for me.
>> ARTICLE
Both of those are 2 of my all-time favorites.  Shinsekai Yori takes a while to rev up, but the second half is sooooo good and ties everything together really well.

And Oregairu is so great because of the characters, among other things.  The cast is seriously awesome, even supporting characters like Komachi and Haruno are well written.
>> ARTICLE
I recently saw Shin Sekai Yori and felt the same way when I started watching it. There were like 2 episodes where the animation was like wtf are you people smoking (I think episode 5 is one of them), however it certainly picks up towards the end of the series with all of the questions that had been built up in the beginning finally getting answered. Also it intentionally does not focus on the character development of the main group, but rather world building and plot. But the villian was one of my favorite anime villians I've ever had the pleasure to watch, he was so interesting!
>> ARTICLE
I'll add that I, too, had to push myself to watch Shinsekai yori until late in the series, but when it was brought to an end I instantly missed it.

Not a masterpiece, but certainly an interesting show. Worth sticking with.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's definitely not for everyone. Personally, I *love* world building, lore, and psychological/dark themes, however I feel like they could have consolidated a couple of the episodes in the middle where it drags, which is why I gave it a 9 and not a 10. I totally had the same reaction though, I thought about it quite a bit after I finished it!
>> ARTICLE
>episode 5

Oh god episode 5.  That might be like the worst animation dip i've ever seen since maybe episode 4 of TTGL.  Ep 5 of SSY was so strange.

I don't really know who the villain might be (at this point i'd guess either the leader of the group who visited their classroom in the 8th episode, or someone who i haven't met yet).  Squealer seems like an awesome character though.  I've tried to avoid spoilers but i've heard that people really empathized with him.
>> ARTICLE
Bahaha yeah it was bad. I think there is one more episode where the animation is kind of like that, but not as bad. I remember watching it thinking that they probably had a different director for the episode or something like that, idk.

Yes, avoid spoilers, but episode discussions as well. There are a couple moments later on in the show where you think it's quite predictable and then the show surprises you. Squealer is my favorite :)

**Hellsing Ultimate (1-8)**
My god Madhouse has done it again. Never before have I seen such a brutal, morals out the window, absolute fucking shit show. By shit show, I do not by any means mean that this show is shit, but rather than it is an insanely masterful work that can only be described as a clusterfuck where the different desires of the many involved parties come crashing together in the most beautiful gorefest I have ever seen. Just wow.

The characters are incredible and their antics constantly have me at the edge of my seat with what I would describe as a look of "shock and awe" permanently etched on my face. The music and art are stunning and continually blow me away. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who loves a good fight or a heavy plot with supernatural and very dark themes. Rated a high 9/10 with still two episodes to go. This show is very easily one of the best I have seen and I cannot wait to finish it.
>> ARTICLE
**Cowboy Bebop** (ep3-14)  
Watching this with a friend and last seasons haven't arrived yet. Intesting stories with a bunch of cool characters. Very episodic so far with no real overarching plot (yet?) but atleast a few flashbacks.

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann** (ep8-18)  
Picked it up last sunday again from episode 7 and stopped after 8. Picked it up again a few days later (yesterday) and watched 9-18. Amazing animation, ~~drilling~~ thrilling story, lovable characters and an outstanding soundtrack for the most part. Probably going to finish this tonight after I watched 10-18 in one sitting. Looks like this anime is the anime to pierce my top 5 list. 
>> ARTICLE
I wish i had the will to finish Gurren Lagann... Started it like 3 months ago but everytime i finish an episode i never want to watch another. I guess it gets better later on?
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same exact way about TTGL. Its great but its not addictive, i never want to just keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
I had the same problem but then one week i was out of shows to watch and i ended up binge watching it since it was in my crunchyroll que. Personally i thought it was way over hyped but was still a good show. It really does get better later on though as the episodes got a lot less episodic which was the biggest thing stopping me watching episodes b2b. I think after episode 11? 
>> ARTICLE
Depends on how far you have watched. For me it got a lot better with the time. I put it off after 6 episodes for a while and couldn't stop watching after episode 8 (kind of).
>> ARTICLE
I am at 12

For me it didnt get good until episode 15-17.

**Texhnolyze (13/22)**

After mentioning it over the su for a few weeks I decided to start and binge it. It is excruciatingly slow and cryptic at first, uses still shots of the town Lux like nobody's business to set in the drab, bleak mood of hopelessness.

Atm the turf wars and politics are under way and I'm having actual fun with this extremely silent series. The characters are silent for the most part, incredibly distant and unemotional, they serve the plot and are more like ideas of people, rather than actual people. Extremely heavy on metaphors, symbolism and does require a lot of attention, assertiveness and understanding. 

This show is heavy without a moment of relief, at most it has ambient silence to take in what was shown/said. As for the story, it's hard to pinpoint, at first it's an "adventure" of our protagonist and a setup for what's to come. It took like 7 episodes of setup, I'm serious here, our protagonist has barely said *one word*. BUt for now it seems to be going into a downward spiral of SENMETSU in an already postapocalyptic world. The sci-fi elements aren't played up as much as the rundown Italian/Roman architecture of Lux, as well as using very old style dial phones and cars.

I plan to finish it tonight and I do hope it delivers without holding back on anything. A rainy day show for those who are looking for something truly dark without going into the ridiculous zone.

**The pet girl of Sakurasou**

I'm following the best girl competition and the ones from this anime won a few rounds, so i checked out the show. It turned out to be quite a decent romcom and exceeded my expectations. I actually want to redo some of my earlier votes now. 
>> ARTICLE
Master of Martial Hearts (5/5) 

Wow, just wow.. 

What starts as a girls-fighting-girls-while-their-clothes-evaporate-from-the-slightest-touch soon turns into a roller coaster of emotions that by the end of it I was laughing like mad. 

The animation is really below average and the amount of forced fanservice is ridiculous, the story is extremely paper-thin and the amount of twists are equivalent to your run-of-the-mill soap opera.

Definitely recommend this if you enjoy bad shows. 
>> ARTICLE
Best bad show if only for the glorious final episode. Haven't laughed that hard at a show in a while.
>> ARTICLE
**Kara no Kyoukai** (Films 4-7):

Ignoring film 6 (a good idea in general), the latter half of the series is much, much stronger than the first. Now that we know a bit more about the characters, the temporal jumping around isn't quite as obnoxious. The cinematography, particularly on Film 5, is utterly stunning. I still have no idea how they pulled off the weaving camera angles on the final fight of that installment with any sort of reasonable animation budget. I'm glad I saw it through to the end, despite my misgivings after the first two episodes.

**Nichibros** (Episodes 1-4): I love the format, and the humour is spot on. My favourite sketches were either the first "Girl by the riverbank" or the impromptu JRPG skit after picking up the Stick of Destiny. Probably going to stretch this series out a bit and just watch an episode here and there.

**Mushi-shi Special**: Not much to say about this one; it's basically just another episode of the same stuff we've seen so far, with more callbacks than are usual. That's not to say that it isn't good, just that there wasn't much reason not to have aired this as a standard episode.

**A Certain Scientific Railgun S** (Volume 2). I've been waiting for the English dub release of this to come out, and finally got around to seeing it. Railgun is one of those shows that I more or less watch in the background while I do other things. It doesn't require a great deal of attention except at the climax, when the visuals draw my eye back to the screen anyway. The second arc with the mysterious blond loli was a definite step down after the Sisters arc, but that really just says more about how great an antagonist Accelerator was.

Artland got delayed, and they couldn't make the deadline for it airing with the rest of the series. So they just aired them as specials before the 2nd half of the show.

**Death Note** Heard a lot about this series (I'm fairly new to anime outside of Miyazaki films, only started really watching series in June). I watched the whole series in a week, something I haven't really done with any show before. I really liked the first arch, and thought that Light and Ryuk's relationship was funny. L was really cool and I liked watching the two match wits. The [](/s "Yotsuba Group arch was kinda weak but picked up afterwords. Really enjoyed the last couple episodes and Teru Miakami is probably my favorite supporting character. As for the ending, I was a little disappointed at first but actually found it fairly fitting that Light was deafted so easily after getting lucky throughout most of the series")

**Outlaw Star**  Picked this series up the other day since it was cheap at a store. Only watched the first episode so far but really like it. The whole space western genre has allays interested me and Outlaw Star appears to be a great example of the genre. 

**Mobile Suit Gundam The 08th MS team** THis is a OVA series set in ever complicated Gundam series. Not very far into it but has been fun so far. Solid 90's action series if that's what you are into

**[Hunter x Hunter](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_\(2011\)): 59-145.**

This is the first time I've binged watched a long running-series since my first anime, Naruto + Naruto Shippuden 2 years ago. My tastes have changed a lot, but I have to say, this is one hell of an adventure shounen. In the show, the comedy and dark tones fit so well with the characters, and the arcs are wonderfully blended together, and training to become strongers comes to fruition. Greed Island was a fun ride and rhe Chimera Ant arc had so many high points, like episode 131, that was ridiculous. Sad I just got on the HxH train right before the show is about to end, but I'm glad to have caught up before it stopped airing. **9/10**

**[Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo): 1-5.**

The comedy in this show is definitely for me. I've laughed out loud so many times that I can't remember everything I've laughed to. I'm liking the ensemble of characters. This show may have potential to be great but we will see.

**[JoJos Bizarre Adventure (2012)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14719/JoJos_Bizarre_Adventure_\(2012\)): 1-4.**

This is easily one of the manliest shows I've ever watched. Animation is quite different than most anime. Plotwise, it's definitely very quickly paced but I'm excited to see the bizarre adventure JoJo goes on.

If you're liking the first arc in Jojo's so much,you're sure to have a blast in the second one.

He shouldn't even bother with the third one, all the fun stops there.

Finished Psycho Pass. Was gooood. Enjoyed it very very much. Looking forward to S2 now.

Steins gate: Hmmmm

Hmmmmm

Hmmmmmm.

I was always a bit dubious about this but I saw the whole series for sale at CeX for 15 and I thought I'd grab it. 

I really enjoyed it. I've loved all the pop culture and internet culture references. I laughed at the fanfiction ones and did a spit take at the reddit AMA reference. I've just got the episode where the 'organisation' comes in and that twist! Was not expecting the betrayal to come from that angle. Looking forward to the rest!

**Fullmetal Alchemist** (30/51)


Man, talk about a show that picked up like crazy. It started off good, the first 7 episodes or so, but it started to feel kinda formulaic and cliche for a bit, so much so that I came close to dropping it. But around the mid-teens, I really started to enjoy it again. Now that I'm more than halfway, I'm completely addicted and am loving it. It's such a step up from your regular old shounen. The characters are great, the story's very interesting, and the action and comedy are spot on. And Armstrong? That guy's awesome!


 I'm really looking forward to watching Brotherhood now!
>> ARTICLE
This is my opinion and maybe someone else will back me on it but, I honestly think Brotherhood is better. The pacing feels better (maybe because I know the plot from the manga) and the dialog is much better. There are sequences of dialog that really makes me love the show. Especially when Ed and Al talk about their past. I also like Brotherhoods ending over FMA. 

I got off track but my point is, your high expectations of Brotherhood are well deserved and will be met or exceeded (IMO). 
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood is better. I mean, it's the number 1 rated anime on MAL for a reason. And in my personal opinion it is better. I normally hate stuff that diverges off the source material, especially when the source material is already good, like the original FMA did. Brotherhood is just something else. It's amazing.

**Wolf's Rain** eps 1-4

I've watched a few disjointed episodes on Animax before but didn't gave it attention and find it boring. Now that my mind has matured somehow, I find it as a very enjoyable watch so far.

STRAY! STRAY! IN THE COLD BREEZE THAT I WALK ALONE...

It's a fantastic series.  Make sure you watch the OVA's at the end, they play out like four final episodes.  Also there are four episodes of recap that play back to back that you can skip without missing anything.

Semester started this week so the volume of what I view on a weekly basis will be dropping considerably and therefore I will be subjecting you all to less word-vomit for a while.

**[Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) (74-81/201)**

Discussion thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2fn375/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_7481/). Yagyu arc this week.

**[Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1519/Black_Lagoon:_The_Second_Barrage) (1-12/12)**

So if you are at all familiar with Black Lagoon, Second Barrage doesnt need much of an introduction. It dives into the balance of power of Roanapur and how Lagoon Company fits into this ecosystem as well as Rock & Revys partnership. This is the backdrop for the usual over-the-top plot points accented by inane villains, incompetent criminals overstepping their abilities, explosion-and-gunfire intensive action sequences, and more than enough filthy language and brutal violence to satisfy whatever quota you need for a show with this kind of offering. 

One thing I really appreciate from the show is how it delivers its more serious and pseudo-poignant points. Its a transfer of broken ideology from broken people, at least in application. The viewer, like Rock, observes it all from the twilight.

**[Usagi Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10162/Usagi_Drop) (1-11/11)**

*Recommended by: relative*

As someone whos at an age where old peers and friends are beginning to settle down, get married, and have children, Usagi Drop is akin to peering at the next stage of life, which, as you can imagine, freaks me the fuck out. However, its portrayal of parenthood is comforting more than anything else. Sure, it asks a lot of the parent and demands a change in lifestyle and values, but it is also enriching in a way that you will more than likely not experience until that point.

I loved the shows portrayal of people and the family unit, particularly the politics that inherently arise on special occasions or events. Pretty much everyone is temperant and good-natured in spite of this bickering, or at least serving an interest outside of the self. Daikichi in particular is fantastic at articulating his thoughts, absorbing things beyond the surface in his environment, and applying that to his new living situation to enhance his personal resolve and his relationship with Rin. Rin is god damned adorable, driving home all of the heart-warming moments with how she interacted with her adoptive father. Fantastic stuff.

**[Sword Art Online](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) (1-25/25)**

*Recommended by: roommate*

I cant possibly say anything to contribute to the crazy amount of rhetoric surrounding this show. So Ill just be as succinct as possible so as to not incite any strong responses:

Gorgeous in presentation, not substance.

**[Air](http://myanimelist.net/anime/101/Air) (1-13/13)**

*Recommended by: reddit*

Something about the setting, characters, and the setup as a whole just didnt relate to me until the last few episodes, which is unfortunate for a show like this. Air builds up to a series of emotionally charged moments, and I was too distanced from what was going on to respond in the intended way when those substantial scenes came into play. The show also took a few left turns that justlost me completely. Not that I didnt understand what was going on; it was the method of conveying the message that didnt resonate with me.  That being said, the final arc touched on some subjects that did catch my attention, the backgrounds were a treat for a show almost 10 years in age, and the sound design worked effectively for whatever was meant to be accomplished at the time.

I cant possibly say anything to contribute to the crazy amount of rhetoric surrounding this show. So Ill just be as succinct as possible so as to not incite any strong responses:
Gorgeous in presentation, not substance.

Obligatory something something literally hitler first arc was better power fantasies weak characters crap plot misogynistic fairies tentacles.

Summarized beautifully, thank you

Glad to see you enjoyed Second Barrage as well. Rock really does make for an excellent protagonist and helps you see the world we're subjected to in a gray light rather than the dark and gritty normalcy everyone else is used to. All that's left, sadly, is the Roberta's Trail OVA. 

Edit: Second Barrage not Second Raid, this is Black Lagoon not Full Metal Panic. 
>> ARTICLE
Whoa, you really did come back to check up on my post! Thank you kindly. I'll be checking out Roberta's Trail this week, and maybe the manga afterwards. It'd be nice to have a solid action series on the back burner.
>> ARTICLE
Of course I did, I refreshed the heck outta this topic waiting to see your post! I haven't checked out the manga for Black Lagoon but you're in for a real treat with Roberta's Trail. If you thought she was a monster badass in the show, you haven't seen anything yet!

**Btooom!** (1-12/12)
I literally just finished not 30 minutes ago. I...I *need* more. Second season plis! Although I would argue that the MC has some of the biggest plot armour ever.

**Gunbuster** (1-6/6)
This was a nice anime. Had that total 80's vibe which was pretty awesome. (Was made in '88-'89.) A liked the ending. Debating whether to watch Diebuster. Loved the black and white of the last episode. While I know it wasn't a stylistic choice and they just ran out of money, it was still a nice touch.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I actually hated Btooom. I finished it in 2 days (6 episodes a day) and I thought some of the scenes were so unrealistic and shit.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely watch Diebuster just be ready for something completely different. It's more like TTGL in it's over-the-topness but it ties in beautifully with Gunbuster.
>> ARTICLE
> Debating whether to watch Diebuster.

Unless you have a particular objection to 2000s Gainax it's definitely worth giving it a try: it's only another six episodes, after all. And whatever you think of the rest of it the ending is neat.

**Chihayafuru**  
I haven't really watched sport anime before and I went into this not realizing this was one.  
It had a bit of a slow start with the childhood flashback but after that I couldn't stop marathoning it. The music and art are amazing. The characters all really fleshed out, even what you would consider side characters. Like I said I don't watch sport anime so it was nice having real tension in every match as there was always a good possibility of the main characters losing.  
  
My only gripe with the art are the eyes. The pupils are too high up, I wonder why they did it like that because it throws me off.
>> ARTICLE
> My only gripe with the art are the eyes. 

That's a standard style for anime based on josei manga like Chihiyafuru. Even Nana has that style, and that's probably the most well-known josei anime there is.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I just looked at some images and it looks like the pupils are fine in Nana, it just uses speculars above it a lot.  
Why would they place pupils off center in the iris in the first place?

**No Game No Life** (Episodes 1-7)

Started yesterday, not expecting too much, because I was annoyed by how much popularity the NGNL characters in the best girl competition had. I went in with a "lets see what all the hype is about" mentality, and immediately I noticed some things that caught my interest:

**Art**- The Artwork in this anime is so unique, I was thrown off but was mildly impressed with its originality.

**Concept**- The plot of NGNL seemed mildly interesting when I read the KissAnime description, but when I actually started watching the show it became so much more interesting. The episodes seemed to flow into each other so it was easy for me to binge the first half. 

**OP**- People who follow my posts (Haha basically literally probably no one) would know that I am a die-hard fan of Sakurasou No Pet na Kanojo! (had a hell of a time watching it and it changed my outlook on life entirely) After doing some research because some things seemed familiar between the 2 shows I was extremely surprised and pleased to notice that the people who voice Sora and Shiro from NGNL are the same people who voice Sorata and Mashiro from Sakurasou! I was even more pleased to see that Suzuki Konomi was the singer of the intro song, "This Game". "Days of Dash", another song that she sang, was one of the ED's of Sakurasou and the first anime song that moved me so much that I was compelled to download it and put on my iPod xD. 

Overall, I am very impressed and pleased with NGNL. I hope that there is a second season that will be put out asap! Also I will factor in my new-found love for the best girls in NGNL into my votes for the Best Girl Competition :) 

Thank you for reading this post, I appreciate that people take the time to read this lengthy mess of words!

They're not exactly made by the same team but the two shows share some key staff, notably the director and one of the scriptwriters, [thus](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/compare.php?anime_list=14238-15784).

**Watamote.** (Completed)

Man, what to say... I didn't even like the comedy most of the time. Yet, I was still strangely compelled to binge watch all the episodes in one sitting. Hell, I don't even have social anxiety in real life, so it's not like I related to the show at all. The show honestly made me sad, I just pitied Tomoko so much. All she wanted to be was popular, and she just couldn't... no matter how much she tried. I liked how it wasn't like the typical shy-girl plot though. In the end, she never found love or a new friend or anything. At the end, she still had only one friend, anxiety, and was still depressed. Her story WAS trivial in the end. The OP and ED were good, though. Oh, and that *voice acting.* AMAZING! I still don't know why I watched it, maybe it's because I just had my fingers crossed the entire time? (One more thing, this is the first SoL I've watched were I actually started to tear up.)
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who really *really* disliked Tomoko. I understand the anxiety and the depression but dear god is she an asshole. 
>> ARTICLE
It'd be kind of odd for an immature, depressed, and extremely anxious teenage girl to be a ray of sunshine. I like that the show doesn't pull any punches in regards to her character. 

She is a bad person in a lot of respects but I rooted for her to get better.

**Fate/Zero** (Episodes 1-25): 

I watched the entire Fate/Zero series for the first time a couple days ago and it was an awesome series! The action sequences were top notch. The characterizations of the series's characters were great as it made me root for some characters and root against other characters (e.g. Castor and his master). It was tragic the way Lancer and Kariya suffered so much as they had the best intentions in entering the tournament for the holy grail. Stand out characters include Lancer, Rider, and Saber, imo. Also, it was great to see the progression of Waver that resulted from Rider's influence. Overall, it was a great series that has an amazing soundtrack and one of my favorite anime series! I would give it a 10/10 and would re-watch it one day. 
>> ARTICLE
If you liked Fate/zero's soundtrack, you may enjoy a wide selection of other soundtracks by the same composer (Yuki Kajiura). She's scored many shows/games.

**Spice and Wolf series**: I was looking for some raunchy RomComs and came across it. Did not expect economics. I was only able to understand what they're talking about half of the time because I'm an idiot when it comes to trade and currency, but it was enough for me to finish and enjoy it. Holo is love, Holo is life. Now I know why people want a third season so badly.

**Mahou Sensei Negima!**: Just started it. I'm reading the manga ahead of the episodes, just because. I totally recognized Takamichi's VA as the big snake thing from Otorimonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
> Now I know why people want a third season so badly.

The light novels are great if you want to continue the story. The anime only covers four of the first five (it skips one) and there are 17 total. The last several novels have official translations coming over the next year or two and even the unofficial translations are good if you can't wait.
>> ARTICLE
Been pretty much only trying to catch up on some currently airing shows this week but I did end up watching to non-airing shows:

**Thermae Romae (1 - 6)** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12321/Thermae_Romae/reviews)

I did not think I would enjoy an anime about a Roman architect that gets teleported to nowadays Japan but boy was I surprised. The show doesn't have much of a story and very basic art and animation. But! It was both funny and educational. There were many scenes where the MC discovers things that are to us things of everyday life but to him mind blowingly amazing.

**Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan 1 - 25)**  [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin) | [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/attack-on-titan)

Rewatching it because of [SourceFed NERD Anime Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqBXvB8oCkc&). Watching giant naked people eat little annoying people with cool gear was still a great experience.

>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, someone else who watched *Thermae Romae*. I don't think I've met anyone else on Reddit who's seen it (or at least I don't remember.)

What did you think about the use of Flash animation? It's pretty rare to see it in anime; I think the only other show I've seen that used it extensively was [*Ping Pong the Animation*](https://vimeo.com/102103466)
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think much of it. I was surprised at first but as the episode went on I got used to it.
>> ARTICLE
I saw a couple of episodes of Thermae Romae, but it didn't really grab me and I never bothered to finish it.

I was however greatly amused to learn that there is a live action movie version.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I didn't think it was a particularly clever comedy. I do appreciate it for how eccentric it is, though, and I can appreciate odd animation. 
>> ARTICLE
Thermae Romae fans unite!

The animation in general was adorably awful, in the same way that Inferno Cop's was. I still haven't managed to track down subtitled versions of the specials, though.

There were lots of cross-overs, right? I remember there being a recently announced toothbrush promotion that used *Thermae Romae*.

[Suisei no Gargantia/Gargantia of the Verdurous Planet](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16524/Suisei_no_Gargantia): Was just looking for something to watch and this one caught my eye.

**Hyperdimension Neptunia: The Animation** (Eps 1-11)

My friend introduced me to the game series and i decided to pick up rebirth1 and I'm having a ball with it. Then he showed me the anime and found it hilarious. The game and show are pretty niche inclined in that all the girls are sexualized. It's honestly not that great of an anime but it's still a fun watch, although you need some prior knowledge of the game to understand what's going on.

**Monogatari Series: Second Season** (Eps 1-16)

Finally decided a while back to watch the Monogatari Series. And I can honestly say i regret my decision to postpone my watching it because it's marvelous. I've been skipping the recap episodes in the Second season since I had watched those arcs literally a few days before. Other than that I'm still enjoying the ride so far. Although [Monogatari Series: SS spoilers] (/s "I hope the problem with Sengoku is resolved in a nice way since she was one of my favorite characters.

X-post from TrueAnime:  

**Cardcaptor Sakura (24/70)**

---

My thoughts haven't really shifted much in these dozen or so episodes. I guess I can talk about the characters this time. Mei-Ling's introduction sort of hangs like an albatross at this point. Having the comically-obsessed childhood fiance show up like she walked out of a Rumiko Takahashi manga might not have been so grating back when that trope wasn't run into the ground so hard it was swimming around in the liquid core of the Earth, but not so much in 2014. For a show with a surprisingly nuanced and relatable cast, she just doesn't seem like she really belongs or serves any real purpose besides allowing the show to make [humorously meta observations about itself.](http://i.imgur.com/4na8QLZ.jpg)  Maybe she'll evolve beyond one-joke clingy jealous girl, but the show will have to work pretty hard to give her any kind of actual personality at this point.

But enough about mediocre characters! Have I mentioned how spectacular it is to have Sakura actually written like a believable 10-year-old girl? Anime Children tend to come in two primary varieties: helplessly innocent moeblob or implausibly precocious dilettante. Sakura seems to occupy the much more sensible middle-ground. She's curious and brave, but not fearless. Her deathly fear of ghosts is mostly played for laughs(and doubles as an inter-textual worldbuilding detail with xxxHolic), but still communicates a sense of vulnerability and naivete. She's prone to temper-tantrums and emotional outbursts, but still has a strong sense of duty and empathy. Xiaolang and Tomoyo less so, but not as egregious as Mei-Ling. Tomoyo in particular is a little too Mary Sue/Yamato Nadeshiko to really be believable next to Sakura, but still has enough personality to stand out. Xiaolang is a bit more nuanced, but the "duty, honor, legacy!" schtick falls pretty flat in terms of characterization. Really, the best character next to Sakura might have to be Kero. Not much in the way of complexity, being the token fuzzy mascot character, but certainly no slouch in the personality department. He's likable, well-rounded, and even has understandable flaws. The rest of the cast of mostly archetypal supporting roles, though I still think Yukito is one suspicious motherfucker. Nobody fuckin' smiles that much!

So yeah, show's still good. Still kinda stuck on the same hurdles, but the formula has proven itself to have a surprising amount of longevity and entertainment value.

**Zetsuen no Tempest (17/24)**

I'm really liking this show. I kinda liked the first cour more, but it's still great in my opinion. I especially liked the travelling/communicating back then more. The soundtrack is good and so is the art. I like the characters and the way the story is playing out.

I will write a more detailed post about it next week, when I have completed it, but I'm quite positive so far. If I'd have to give it a rating, it at least deserves a 8/10-9/10, depending on how they end it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely agree about the first cour being stronger, but it still has a pretty solid ending and overall is a really good show regardless.
>> ARTICLE
It's easily one of the better series to come out in the last few years.  The first half of the show is considerably better than the second half and that did hurt it imo.
>> ARTICLE
**Durarara!! 13/25**  
Don't know why I started it or how did I manage to watch the first few episodes where I didn't know what was happening (I still am a little lost) but it's a pretty good anime with good visuals and OST.

**The World Only God Knows (All 3 seasons)**  
At first I didn't like it but as more episodes I watched the serires grew on me. A thing I didn't like was that it felt that a lot of content was lef out between S2 and S3. Score 8/10

**Gintama 81/201 (Re-watch)**  
It still as funny as my first watch. It's nice to see that this sub has a [re-watch thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2fn375/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_7481/) where I can discuss or say what I liked of each episode.

**Digimon Adventure 22/54 (Re-watch)**  
Watching it in order to have the serires fresh when the sequel comes out.

Read the manga. If you gave the series an 8/10 you'll *love* the manga. The first two seasons are very, *very* faithfully adapted, but after that they skip *so much* content and then they rush the Goddess Arc. 
>> ARTICLE
That's what I'm doing. Currently at Chapter 86, so I think I'm reading the skipped content and yes loving the manga so far.

There are a couple OVAs that go over some of the material between season 2 and three but even with them a lot of the manga was skipped.

**Legend of the Galactic Heroes** 10-42/110

I'm liking the way things are going, everyone trying to control everyone, however I noticed I'm often getting sleepy during it. I know I've been tired, but that didn't happen in other shows even on busier times, so that may pull me back a bit from this. I had once to pause, watch a few "Just for gags" pranks to wake up... >_<  
One thing that bothers me is the animation/art quality. It varies a lot during the same episode. I know that it is an old show, but I feel like it'd feel better if it was constant (even if the constant was the lower quality one). Here one example, on the same scene, 4 seconds apart from each other: [Here](http://imgur.com/aQBUWq4,es56id4) and [Here](http://imgur.com/aQBUWq4,es56id4#1)  
One of my previous complains indeed became rare ("Old man ignoring good advice"), so that's a plus.


**Rurouni Kenshin - Tsuioku-Hen** 4/4

I was a fan of Samurai X (as it is called in Brazil) when it aired here on Cartoon Network, and I always heard about the OVAs, how they were a master piece, an work of art, must see to any anime watcher. Having watched it... I agree that it is very good, but, given the hype, I was kinda disapointed.  
Watching Kenshin grow and love was pretty pleasing and the ending was really sad, probably tear worthy (but they didn't come this time). I'll still recommend it to anyone (I used to recommend even without having watched it myself... yeah, that was how much the hype had gotten me to), but I will try not to hype that much.
>> ARTICLE
> It varies a lot during the same episode. I know that it is an old show, but I feel like it'd feel better if it was constant (even if the constant was the lower quality one). Here one example, on the same scene, 4 seconds apart from each other

What you're looking at in the second image are digital alterations made for the DVD release (and carried over onto the BD release). Unfortunately the only way, that I'm aware of, to see the show without them is to watch the laserdisc rips, which obviously aren't as crisp. That said, sometimes -- sometimes -- the digital alterations are actually cleaning up errors in the original animation. 

The good news is that the art and (to a lesser extent) the animation improve over time -- since it was made over a decade -- and by the later parts of the show it's less error-prone and more attractive. Though it's never really an anime which impresses in its animation.

**ef: A tale of memories**
I have been watching this in between the new episodes of currently airing shows and another show that isn't airing, and honestly this show has become my favorite romance. Animation and sound are top notch, and the developing relationships between the different couples feel much more real than other romance animes, in my opinion atleast. 

**Akagi**
I actually mentioned this in a comment on a post about which shows were great but generally unpopular, and Akagi definitely fits that well. I don't even know how to play mahjong, but holy shit is the psychological warfare in this show some seriously intense shit. It reminds me of other shows about sports/games, but it's much more mature. If I knew how to play mahjong, and the show didn't end on a kind of unfulfilled note, it'd be a 10/10 for me (still a strong 9 though) 
>> ARTICLE
Did you notice the lack of females in Akagi? Like I understand they want to stay away from fanservice in a serious anime, but I found that a tad unrealistic.
>> ARTICLE
I've always thought it seems pretty realistic that there aren't any females in the 1950s Yakuza circles.
By the way, if you liked Akagi you should totally give Kaiji a watch; same artist, better animation, better plot (IMO).
>> ARTICLE
What about the factory Akagi worked at for a while? What about their walks in the streets? I just wanted to see a female drawn in that wacky style only seen in Akagi.

**Sekirei (12/12) - 5/10**
A rather weak first half overshadows the second half of the first season.  There's too much focus on the "harem hijinks xdd" to make me want to actually care about the girls when they're actually in danger.


**Ben-to (12/12) - 8/10**
An affable parody of shounen fighting anime with people beating the shit out of each other for lunchables.  Packs a surprisingly good and rapid-fire sense of humor on the same lines as something like, say, Noucome.  Plays with the notion of "the power of friendship," and has enough different plot elements to keep the episodes moving.

**Arpeggio of Blue Steel (12/12) - 8/10**
Though the CGI put me off when it first aired, I decided to givs the show another go this week on a whim, and I'm glad I did.  Neat as fuck worldbuilding and ship design in addition to the high-caliber chess matches that the protracted fights turn into make for an enjoyable watching experience.  The story itself isn't predictable, and while the CGI isn't ignorable, it's not near as glaring by the end.

Also, Takao a best, Iona a worst.

This past week i saw 
**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!**
i totally loved this show from start to finish the comedy was great and the story was good as well. i definitely recommend you give it a watch.

**Maoyuu Maou Yuusha** 
this anime right here was really good it was recommended to me by my best bud and it was really amazing. its a historical anime so if your not into that then don't watch. but if you don't care please by all means give it a watch. Basically it takes place around the times of the crusades. its really awesome i wont spoil anything by rambling on. but go watch it and see for yourself 
>> ARTICLE
As someone who doesn't usually get into either SoL or romance, I have to admit, Chuunibyou has charm like no other, and I'm so glad I watched it!

A lot of people around these parts didn't like the second season much, but don't let that deter you from watching it. The second season wasn't as strong as the first (mostly because the charm of the first season has already become norm to the viewer, in my opinion), but I still enjoyed it a lot :)
>> ARTICLE
well im glad to hear that about the second season ill definitely make sure to watch that this week then  
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna give you the opposite advice. I'm gonna go a lot farther than "it wasn't as strong as the first" to "it basically has no reason to exist". It takes most of the series to actually get to anything resembling an arc, and then it doesn't really go anywhere important with it. There's no good conclusion to that arc and makes it feel as if all the time in the show had been for nothing. The handful of interesting ideas are basically glossed over or irrelevant a minute after they happen. It's essentially a bad filler season.

Both series are silly, but the biggest difference is that the first season had substance. The second season had none.

I'm coming along with **Legend of the Galactic Heroes**. I'm at 87 now.

Well, I have **LoGH Gaiden** left, and the movies too.

**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (26/26)**

As a huge fan of the manga, this adaptation is absolutely incredible. I don't know why I took so long to watch this. The only complaint I have is with the Phantom Blood arc, which is probably the weakest arc anyways, and is more of just a prologue to the other arcs. It's nothing to do with the quality of the adaptation though, because it's pretty much 1:1. Battle Tendency is more awesome than I could imagine animated. Can't wait to move on to Stardust Crusaders!

**The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (3/28)**

Not sure what to think of it so far. The main character is pretty cool, if maybe a big clich. I'm not really sure about Suzumiya, though. She's an annoying Tsundere right now, and I'm really hoping she doesn't stay like that. The other characters so far are pretty clich also. But I hear the show is pretty good (8.2 on MAL), so I think I'll stick it out, at least for now.

What I'm loving most is learning about the characters pasts, mainly the MC. That was just SOO good. I'm looking forward to finishing it soon.

**TL;DR** - Angel Beats! is the shit.

**Dennou Coil** (Everything)

As someone who really likes near-future science-fiction, this show was like a blessing to me. There were a few ass-pulls, but meh, at least they were semi-believable. Highly underrated show with good plot, characters and art style.

**Summer Wars**

Not really a masterpiece and full of ass-pulls, but a honestly really entertaining movie. Not much to say here, the characters were not extremely relatable but were not particularly badly written either.

**Panty and Stocking** (1-6)

Hoo boy, this show is a hell of a ride. It's honestly bad but actually really hilarious. (sperms attacking a dick-shaped tissue factory for revenge, pls) It fits the definition of anime (japanese animation), but it's honestly more similar to western animation (I think it's supposed to be a parody of it?) than to anime. The music kicks ass though.

I started **Black Jack OVA (3/12)**

I'm not enjoying this show as much as I thought I would, and I think the main reason for that is that it's very easy to compare it to House. And that's not a very favorable comparison for Black Jack. There also are some 90's specific animation "tricks" that I'm very glad has been (mostly) antiquated; "let's show every single dramatic thing that happens 3 times in rapid succession with dramatic music".
I will continue watching, but I hope my impression of it as a "strange 90's (or 80's) House with a loli sidekick" will pass. This is definitely the weakest work by Tezuka I've encountered so far.

I've also watched somewhere around 50 episodes of **Detective Conan (487/-)** this last week. 

Detective Conan is a show I go back to once or twice a year to binge-watch, and it really is a fun show. The tricks are (mostly) imaginative and the characters are all enjoyable. It's also really good at giving the impression that the plot is moving forward, when in reality nothing has really happened in the last 300 episodes. I wish the mangaka would include more cross-overs with Magic Kaito, as those episodes are easily some of the best. But I guess he has aspirations to continue Magic Kaito as an independent series some day as well.

Yeah I think the Black Jack OVA's are decent, but the freeze frame and dramatic stuff gets kinda annoying. The movie of the OVA series is a little better than the OVA series itself. I haven't seen much of the more recent Black Jack series but I know the art looks more like traditional Tezuka style

**Tetsujin 28-go (2004)  17-26 (END):** It graduated from the shorter mysteries, and these last episodes were all part of one continuous plot. It was quite well put together, and I liked the way it drew upon elements of the earlier stories so that everything seemed reasonable - by that I mean that there seemed to be a logical basis for everything. This became quite important with all the double-crossing and people disguising themselves. 

I have two main gripes with this series: the ending felt rushed, and there was one mystery that went unresolved. [http://i.imgur.com/bgc9hbA.jpg - in this scene the spy cuts the phone cord and we see him take out his gun. It then fades to black with the sound of shots firing, but Kenji is ok. And later on there's a point where Kenji should recall meeting the man, but he does not.](/spoiler) It just made no sense as a scene. It could have been there to intentionally throw the viewer off the trail, but it doesn't work well even for that.

That aside, I'd recommend this as a mystery anime. It's like a longer version of Giant Robo in a lot of ways, but without the spectacle. The mecha action is poor or not present, so it isn't worth trying if that's what you want to see.

**Aria the Animation (END):** This felt quite hit or miss. All the episodes that had Akari looking into the past had a perfect atmosphere, and I don't remember any of the others reaching quite the same level. Except for the one that had Alicia and friends reminiscing about their time as singles. Conversely, there were a few episodes (that I don't remember) that practically put me to sleep. 

**Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live 11-33:** I actually started this a year ago, shortly after Aikatsu S2 started. I put it on hold indefinitely, and only now am I actually aiming to complete the franchise. Unfortunately it isn't as good as PriPara.

It's about the opposite of Aikatsu in a lot of ways. There are strong rival characters, and a lot of conflict. Drama happens just about every episode, and a lot of it is hard to watch. The saving graces so far are (some of) the performances and the [boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRqQMsy9i8). The boys are all crazy in their way, and any characters over-reacting usually end up the highlight of an episode.

There's a lot of family drama, and just about everybody has terrible parents. That part isn't fun at all. Then there are performances like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RafIqp-eu0) which begin to make up for all the bad. They aren't all good, though - many of them replay the same songs without even changes to the outfits. The jumps are often poorly timed and turn into stock footage fests, too. 

**Ginga Senpuu Bryger 1-4:** All you need to know about this is that it has a [kickin rad OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG5DaDCeEN8) and an almost equally good sound track. That isn't enough to keep me watching it though. The rest of the content is terrible; the animation is just about non-existent (despite the OP often being used as an example of Kanada-style sakuga) and the other mecha I've seen from that time period look a lot better. The four main characters (Bowie, Kid, Angel, and Isaac) become a team really suddenly in the first episode with practically no explanation. Their interactions make it seem like they're all trying too hard to sound cool, and they say "yay" far too much. There doesn't seem to be an overarching plot, which isn't an issue, but the in-episode scripts are bad. Nothing much ties scenes together, and there can be inexplicable jumps between hapennings.

I'll probably never watch this again unless I've exhausted my supply of the genre. It wasn't as terrible as I'm making it out to be, but it just isn't worth my time.

**Ashita no Najda 1-10:** Not much to say about it yet, but I'm getting really into it. It's very much in the WMT school of anime, which I like. And I'm a sucker for floofy dresses and this time period.

**Smile Precure 26-33:** Just about all of these episodes were great. Candy's emotional moments work really well, and she's probably one of the best mascot characters I've seen.

Rainbow Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin ( 24/26)

Just wow, great series so far, had really high epectations for it and was not disapointed. Everything is done so well. The only complain that i have is that at the beggining they dont explore all the characters but later they do a really good job telling about their stories ( for most of them). Amazing OST. The OP made into my top 10. :) 

Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya (10/10)

This show is actually really good. Finished Fate/Kaleid and was gladly surprised by the show, didnt expected it to be that much fun to watch. The commedy is fun and the action scenes, omg that action, was really fucking good, better than a lot of shounens out there. Didnt liked the drama that much, but everything else was really enjoyable. Its kinda weird to see the characters of Fate in a moe-ish animation. But seriously give it a try. Its a really enjoyable show to watch. 7,743/10

* Outlaw Star 5/26:

Even though the art is old, it has pretty enjoyable story so far. Gene is like the stereotypical *Aniki* and that makes it so awesome. I'm seriously looking forward to finish this series ASAP.

* K-On!! 8/27:

You know, it's fucking K-On. Mio is best girl. Loving all those *Awwww* moments this animes makes you say. And it's pretty funny too.

* Hunter x Hunter 15/148:

I randomly decided to start this the other day and I really got an One Piece, Yu Yu Hakusho feel about it. You know, all that shonen stuff. It felt like going back in time when I was a kid and got super hyped to watch a show on the TV!

I crushed out spice and wolf on Sunday and Monday, I'm at peace that it will never get an ending because I accepted that before I started.

**White Album 2** (Episodes 1-6)

I haven't been this excited to watch an anime since I started Jojo's Bizarre adventure 4 months ago. What put me off from starting this was the bad rep the anime gets (although I think it was just season 1) but wow, this is a pretty good romance. As cliche as love triangles are, I am a sucker for good ones, and this one has me hooked, cheering for both girls and hoping neither gets hurt, I can't wait for the real drama to kick in.
>> ARTICLE
I was going on a romance spree, starting with Seto no Hanayome. Loved how the feMC wasn't tsundere and was actually dere. The secondary love interest kind of suck, but the rest of the supporting cast more than made up for it. And it was pretty funny thought the romance aspect felt a little short.


Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!
The show was okay, the mc was better than in most other show in the sense that he actually confess somewhat early. The character development is kind of lack luster though.


Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou
The art was pretty nice, and I enjoyed the side characters. FeMC was cool, but something about the MC's voice irked me. The story wasn't that great, but considering that it was not really completed yet, I can't really complain.


Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo
This show is amazing. Initially I was kind of turned off due to the description of the show and had assume that it is a pure fan service ridden show. Not that it wasn't filled with fan service, but the show actually had a solid plot and characters and the fan service wasn't as distracting as in other shows (such as kore wa zombie). The cast were all quite well developed, save for the programmer dude who was still had more personality than most MCs in lesser shows. Had I stop watching anime, this would have been my top rated romance anime though it is less about the romance, and more about the people.

White Album 2
I wished the feMC had different names. I keep thinking that the pianist is going to punch nuns into joining her harem while the singer going to go all "I AM GUNDAM". Aside from that this show is perfect, and that I wish that I finished Amagami SS before touching on this because other romance anime feel so lacklustre after watching this. 

Gosick
Again, another show that needs to give the femc a better name, though honestly the name was perfect, but after hearing for the 80th time or so the mc calling out "Victorique", it gets really annoying. The setting was nice thoughtl they didn't really explain the "lovely monster" thing at all.

I'm currently watching **Yu Yu Hakusho** (11/112) :D

 As a huge fan of Hunter x Hunter, I figured it would be worth the watch that I never gave it when I saw it on TV when I was a teen, and I'm really glad I did! I always assumed that ~~black haired Killua~~ Hiei would be my favorite character, but I find that Kuwabara has actually taken that spot so far :o

I can't say too much about the plot right now, as it's a bit hard to judge a 112 episode show having only seen 11 of them, but I love it so far! Togashi just writes such great characters! I'm really excited to finally have started this ride n.n

Hopefully it will help fill the hole HxH will be leaving behind in a few weeks ;_;

I also watched **Psycho Pass**, but I don't think /r/anime needs me to tell them why it was great ;)

 it is simply the greatest show.


 I went into it expecting to love it completely, and I completely LOVE IT.

It's about to be the first DVD box set I've bought since I stopped all those years ago.


 I'm so psyched there's more manga now, because it possibly could mean more anime in a couple years.

 Also, still rewatching Attack on Titan, dubbed, same channel.

 On second watch, I still really like it.

 The dub might not be Black Lagoon level, but it's damn good anyway.

**[Sukitte Ii na yo.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14289/Sukitte_Ii_na_yo.) (Say "I love you") 1-10/13** - So far I'm really enjoying it, particularly as a calmer series to follow Toradora. Something feels off about this series compared the other shoujo romances I've seen, but in a good way. [Possibly...](/s "I think it's that they get together early on and the rest of the time is exploring their relationship.")

**Natsume's Book of Friends** (seasons 1-3)

I was looking for another good SoL anime to watch and luckily for me I stumbled across this show.  This show evokes the feels very well, not in a Clannad way where it gut punches you with tears but in a way that leaves you bubbly and happy. For the most part each episode is its own little emotional journey where you meet a variety of interesting side characters who you end up loving. Overall this is just a fantastic show I would recommend to anyone with a basic knowledge of Japanese folklore (nothing advanced just youkai and tengu and stuff like that)  9/10

So, I Can't Play H? (finished). I decided to watch it on a whim, and it wasn't bad. I probably won't remember much of it in a month, but the fight scenes were entertaining, boobs, and near the end it actually got somewhat heartwarming. I probably could have spent the time better, but it was entertaining. It was a lot like Highschool DxD but not really as good.

Haiyore! Nyarko-san: episode 1. I read a bit about this and the premise is interesting. So far it looks pretty funny, and I like the male tsundere gags.

Zankyou no Terror: episode 1. Looks interesting. I am not sure I quite get 12 yet, but that may come in time. Also, that nuclear power plant (I think that's what it was) had really awful security.

**Space Brothers**: Episodes 40 - 71

Although the three recap episodes in the mid-50s were a huge waste for me, I suppose they were useful for people that were watching it while they all came out. After all, it had been over a year for them since the show started rather than a couple of weeks ago that it is for me.

And yes, I'm still loving it. Every episode makes me more and more inspired... Too bad I'm too fucking old to change my ways all that much. 

Projected score: high-8 to low-9.

**Kyoufu no Bio Ningen Saishuu Kyoushi**: **COMPLETE**

I am not a smart man. Anyone that sees my List can know this just by noting how many gods-awful anime I have subjected myself to over and over and *ohgods* over again. You can add The Ultimate Teacher to that list. It is the epitome of awful nonsensical anime, yet I can see how it has influenced shows that came later. I can see the beginnings of GTO, TTGL, and KlK in this. It's the same over-the-top no-limits no-holds-barred spirit that fuels some of this sub's favorite titles.

So I will actually recommend this one. Yes, it's got a bad rep. And yes, it definitely deserves that bad rep. Yet is a should-watch for all fans of Great Teacher Onizuka, Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan, and Kill la Kill.

**Score**: low-4  
Recommendation level: More people around here than you would initially think.  

**Korean Zombie Desk Car**: **COMPLETE**

Aaaaaaand it happens yet again. It is the bane of my existence. People tell me that I will love a title, and I sit here for 12 episodes wondering why the universe hates me so much. Absolutely nothing clicked for me. The jokes were stale. The harem was senseless. The gags were bland. The plot was nonsense. And the *plot* was really kinda bland. 

It wasn't an awful anime. It just wasn't the right anime for me at the time.

**Score**: low-6  
Recommendation level: Lovers of mindless faux-harem fanservice anime.

Currently re watching brotherhood after 4 years and just remember how great of  series it is.

**Ajimu: Beach Story** (the whole fucking thing unfortunately)

This was a random-pick anime to watch while I was busy doing other stuff. If you ever want to mix a cheap romance novel with a helping of soap opera, well, this is your thing. There's not much to say about it. It was horribly paced and I frequently wondered why things were happening the way they were, or even how long it had been since the last scene and what I had missed. I had to come up with a lot of justifications for the characters' behavior by myself. A great example of this is between the resolution of the conflict in the first episode and how it affects the second episode. I had to go back and make sure they had actually said the resolution had been the night before, despite them acting as if it had been at least a week ago. The worst parts [were](/s "how Ajimu's ex apparently faked his own death simply so he could leave for all of a year, and how Ajimu woke up Hirosuke from either a coma or death, which is not clear, with her song on the ukelele we've heard a dozen times in four episodes.")

In other words, meh, don't watch it.

**Shiki** (Episode 1-22)

This show started off a bit slow, and I really disliked the character design, however I quickly got over it. It gets going at about episode 7 and gets more and more interesting. It really makes you think. I'd give it an 8/10. Very interesting, hated the character design.

With the last movie being released to the public a couple days ago I decided to start watching the series again. Time feels like it just flies by when I'm watching the show. I'm not a huge fan of the first season so I can't wait to get to Forte. The whole goal of this re-watch is to mainly read the manga after the first two seasons and the fact that Forte is amazing.

**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS** (25/26): And that would bring my complete rewatch of the whole series to a close, with three weeks to spare until the BluRay rerelease of the first season.   
Episode 25 is quite easily the highlight of the season, not just for the conclusion to the Saint's Cradle battle, [but also for Nanoha again proving why she ain't one to be trifled with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBArXz3cWos "always satisfying to see the smugface get the ass handed to her"), and Vivio again showing why she's the best new character from this season, even with the lowest screentime of the newcomers.

**[Welcome to the NHK](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/NHK_ni_Youkoso!)**  
8.5/10. I loved Misaki in this, what an adorable character. I didn't expect this to get as dark as it did but I really enjoyed it. Some parts of it really hit home with some experiences I've had with a friend in the past, which I think enhanced the experience a bit, especially in the last episode.

**[Mobile Suit Gundam 00](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2581/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_00)** (ep 1-3)  
The anime club at my college had its first meeting today and we took a vote on what to watch. It came down to TTGL, Nichijou, and Gundam, and Gundam won, which was my least favorite of the three. But the premise looks interesting, I'll still show up to the meetings to watch it.

**[Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time)** (ep 1-2)  
I finished Toradora! recently and heard this had a better ending, plus I've heard a lot about it, so I thought I'd pick it up. It looks good!

I have just finished binge watching **Neon Genesis Evangelion (whole series)** and its **Rebuild Movies (1.11, 2.22, and 3.33)** [which](/s "is inferior to the original series.") this weekend.

Til now I have only heard of it through internet-word-of-mouth and other internet hype. Now that I am finished with it, I am really amazed and impressed with it! Amazing characters and amazing mech fights, I am truly impressed. 

Of course, it does have its (valid) criticisms, as its fans are [well aware,](/s "Congratulations!"). 

I just think that if only the series were better planned out, with a few more episodes to spare, it would truly push NGE from the great series it already is, to god-tier status.

**Clannad and Clannad After Story**

Wanted to finally watch the show to see what the hype was about. I wasn't expecting much, but I loved it. After Story I found to be pretty disappointing for the first 14 episodes (it was a lot weaker than Clannad), but from episode 15 onward my score shot up from a 8 to a 9.5. Da feelz. 
>> ARTICLE
**Durarara 18-25**: I enjoyed them, though I would have liked to see what ends up happening with Celty and her head; Izaya did stir up the conflict in Ikebukuro in some attempt to 'awaken' it, after all. Perhaps that will be shown in the upcoming sequel? Still, it was nice seeing the plot threads about Dollars, Yellow Scarves, and the Slasher tied up.

**Inuyasha 90-96**: Filler is filler ... but I have to get through it to get back to canon. The ones taking place in the feudal era are a bit more tolerable than the borefest fillers in Kagome's time, though 96's premise struck me as fairly ridiculous, given that Sesshoumaru has Tenseiga. Oh well. The new OP video looks interesting - a tease for what canon will be like once I get to it.

Steins;Gate was just awesome! It started really slow for me but after a few episodes I was hooked in.

I've had a really busy week

[**Paprika**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=1943)-  I went into this movie with pretty much no information on it other than it was a Satoshi Kon film.  The plot and characterization is pretty thin, but the animation and sound is absolutely beautiful.  I typically don't enjoy anime with a shallow plot but this was definitely an exception to that rule.  Absolutely recommended to anyone that wants to watch something on the shorter side.

[**Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3002/Gyakkyou_Burai_Kaiji:_Ultimate_Survivor) **(ep:1-26)** - It's a series that a good friend of mine has been pushing me to watch for a few months now, but I just hadn't found the time to watch it.  The plot of Kaiji is bleak, and it never strays from that.  If you want to watch a show that is going to make you feel better I would stay far away from this.  With that said, Kaiji does an exceptional job of maintaining a feeling of near hopelessness.  My only real complaint about this series is the abysmal pacing.  You could condense this to a twenty episode series and nobody would miss anything.

[**Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=9756) **(ep:1-12)** - I went into Madoka with extremely high expectations, and that is never something that ends well.  I've never been a fan of the art style used in Madoka, and that did take away some of my enjoyment from this series.  The plot was dark just like I had heard, and Urobuchi did an extremely good job getting that narrative across to the viewer.  It's extremely well done, but I would be lying if I said it met all my expectations.

[**No Game No Life**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life) **(ep: 1-12)** - NGNL does everything that anime does poorly and then expanded on that.  That's not to say that every thing about it is bad, in fact the concept behind the series is an extremely neat one.  The problem is the execution of that concept.  It is riddled with unnecessary fan service(including that of an 11 year old), bad jokes, and an overtone that glorifies being a NEET (in case you didn't know is the human version of a leach or parasite).

I'ts a little bit sad that out of all the great shows I watched over that last week.  The worst one by far is the one that has had the best reception.  I honestly don't see how anime can continue as a art form if shows like NGNL are widely considered some of the best of all time.

If you're talking about the second season of Kaiji, I think 'pretty terrible' is pretty unfair. The pacing *is* worse in the second season's second arc, it's true, but at least you don't have to watch it as it airs. And it has a stronger ending than the first season.

EDIT: A further thought and possibly a comforting one, on NGNL: it might be popular here, right now, but it isn't well-regarded everywhere, and I'll be surprised if it is widely remembered in say 10 years time.
>> ARTICLE
>  I honestly don't see how anime can continue as a art form if shows like NGNL are widely considered some of the best of all time.

It isn't. It's fun and entertaining from time to time but doesn't really do anything remarkable except doing asspulls over and over. For me it was an anime to shut my brain off, stop thinking (entirely) and just watch it for fun (I have a couple of this shows on my list... not looking at you Kenzen Robo Daimidaler...).

**No Game No Life**

Disappointed to find out that it's not a complete story.

**Nisekoi**

I just finished episode 17. Nothing special but it's an amusing romcom.

**Seitokai Yakuindomo**

I'm halfway through the OVAs. This show really has no point besides making lewd jokes.

Since Im posting the thread this week, I suppose I should kick things off.

Man, its been a LONG time since I watched any anime. 3 weeks, in fact, according to my MAL when I updated it today with all that Ive watched in the past week, and even then I only watched episode 1 of Brynhildr in the Darkness. Dunno what caused this, considering its the middle of summer before my Freshman year of college and I have nothing better to do, but whatever. At least this week was better.

**Persona 4: The Animation (6-16):**

As Im replaying the game currently, I decided I should continue watching the anime, which I had started several months back on a whim and then randomly stopped watching (just like almost every other show I pick up). I have to say, I did not quite expect the anime to somehow be so goddamn hilarious. It honestly made some of the funny moments in the game from chuckle-level to oh god, my sides hurt so much. Much of this is probably due to the personality they gave Yu, which is to say make him a complete and utter goddamn troll, who I am pretty sure knows hes a complete troll in at least some capacity. 

**Usagi Drop (1-2):**

Ive only watched 2 episodes of this, and I am already developing diabetes. By the end of this show, itll probably be the most severe case the world has ever seen.

**Sakura Trick (1-7):**

[I think this video just about sums up what I feel about the series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtW_SXe8Cv0&feature=youtu.be&t=3m44s)

No, but seriously, I like what I see. There is a lot of very obvious fanservice, which is what I expected going in, but theres also a lot of daww moments without an overwhelming amount of fanservice, which is really nice to see. The show could still be better, obviously, as some of the fanservice just goes a little too over-the-top and Yuus sister is causing unnecessary drama imo, but hey, Ill take what I can get.

**Devil Survivor 2: The Animation (1-3):**

Never played the game, so this will be my first introduction to it. Seems at least decent so far, but nothing truly special. Hoping it gets better now that things are starting to pick up more and more.

**WataMote (3):**

Like the first two episodes, I liked this one as well. However, also like the first two episodes, I felt horribly uncomfortable while watching it, which I suppose is just a part of the show. It does make it kind of hard to marathon it in any manner, though, which is a problem for my growing unfinished anime list <_<

**Durarara! (3-8):**

The background information on all the characters is really, really nice to see, but I gotta admit: this pacing is slow as hell so far due to it. Ive been told by a friend that it starts to pick up later, kind of like Steins;Gate I guess, so Im going to stick it out, but I just hope that speed up comes soon.

**Samurai Flamenco (1):**

Havent had much time to watch this yet, but Im at least somewhat interested to see where it goes. If nothing else, the concept seems mildly interesting.

**One Piece (1-6):**

And so begins the journey of a thousand miles, the end of which I fear I may never seen. I just hope the openings get better, or I get used to the first one at least, because Im not feeling so hot on it currently.

**Chaika (1):**

I...have mixed feelings on Chaika so far. I know its got a huge hype train going for it, but I just dont know. Something just isnt resonating right with it for me. Maybe it has something to do with watching the show with a friend and him having a negative opinion on it, and Im just conforming because of peer pressure or something? Who knows. Ill probably rewatch the first episode by myself before continuing on with the series, just to be sure.

**Mayouu Maou Yuusha (1-9):**

I literally found out about this anime at like 1am today, and decided to watch it a little bit. Ill admit, the first episode nearly made me not watch the rest for at least a while, as it just didnt really give me a good impression. However, I decided to 3-episode-rule it, and pressed on to the next few.

Holy shit, I am so glad I did that. It got MUCH better starting with episode 2, giving me a fairly good Spice and Wolf vibe that I see others are getting as well based on the old discussion threads. Most of the characters are at least somewhat interesting, it (usually) has a decent balance of light-hearted and serious, the animation looks nice, and the soundtrack is just lovely.

However, what really and truly blew me away was episode 9. I mean, wow. Just wow. Despite all of the anime I have seen before, all of the cool/awesome/tearjerky/good things that I have seen in those anime, never before had I seen something that made me pause the show and then just stand up and freaking clap. The speech given in that episode, however, made me do just that. Despite the fact that it was like 5:30 in the morning, I just stood up and clapped. Even if I look back on the rest of the series and decide it is, at best, decidedly average (especially considering it is an adaptation of an apparently currently-ongoing series), this scene will probably always stand out to me as one that just completely and utterly made the series.


**White Album 2 (1-13):**

I

I made a mistake. I shouldnt have marathoned this series. I sure as hell shouldnt have marathoned it after having not slept for a stupidly long time (damn random insomnia), causing me to be even more emotionally vulnerable. I know Im a sucker for catharsis. I know I feel terrible afterwards, and I sure as hell knew EXACTLY where this was going. I knew from probably a little bit after the midway point near-clearly where it was headed, and yet despite that I pressed on, naively believing that things would get better. That they wouldnt end on the note that it did. But I was wrong, and now I got burned. I got burned harder than I thought I would. I got burned hard enough that Im currently searching for a patch to translate the second half of the visual novel, which takes place 3 years later, in the hopes that I wont get burned again.

But I know I will. After all, happy endings are for suckers, right?

Now, if youll excuse me, I need to go be alone for a little bit, and contemplate on some things. The least of which being the realization that I still have 5-6 more episodes of H20 to watch this next week.

One Piece openings get WORSE IMO. We Are is like....one of the quintessential feel good OPs.

Having the will to go through the lengthy beast that is One Piece is all you need. Keep at it, it will pay off, you're in for an incredible journey (and yes, the openings do become much better).

Yup. That pretty much summed it all up there. If I wanted a love story, I'd dive into some recommendations off of Aoi Hana. But I really wanted happy bouncing girls kissing happy bouncing girls, so it all worked out well.

> White Album 2

Now you know why  we've been praising this show from top to bottom on this sub.

Woah. Dude. WA2 *and* H2O on back-to-back weeks?!? 

You going to be okay, dude? Just checking.

Strange that you can't get into the first opening for One Piece; a lot of people consider it one of the best (including myself). It's just so damn catchy.

Eternal Log is my personal favorite. Or Fight Together albeit somewhat cheesy. I might have to pick the one from Marineford as well. Quite a few I enjoyed.

There is an English review and/or summary of the remainder of the WA2 VN on a blog somewhere. It is very thorough and explains each possible ending as well. If you really want to know the ending, I'm sure a quick google search would find it...(I don't want to link it. Some people don't have enough willpower to resist. If you go looking for it, well that's on you not me.)


>> ARTICLE
You're in for ride with WA2. The VN is supposed to be one of the best out there.
>> ARTICLE
fffff

you watched a lot of old shit this week
>> ARTICLE
I watched what my PS3 Crunchyroll app let me watch. For some reason this past week, it would only let me watch some series, but not others. For the most part this was limited to newer series, like Brynhildr in the Darkness and Nisekoi, but it also randomly affected some older shows, like Nichijou. It would also occasionally change what shows it was and was not affecting, hence why I jumped around even more than usual this week. It seems to have cleared up in the past couple days, though, so hopefully I can stick to one show more consistently now.
>> ARTICLE
60 episodes, to be exact.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus, really? It was actually that much?

*Goes back to count*

...It really was something like that much. God damn, I didn't even necessarily mean to watch that much. It just sort of happened.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I wanted to say it's a lot of shows, but not a lot of episodes, so I counted, and 60 episodes *are* quite a lot. These days I rarely pass 25-30 episodes a week myself. Though a couple of months back I've watched all of Chihayafuru (51 episodes) in 3-4 days, and back around 2011, or 2007, I'd sometimes watch 100-200 episodes in a week (Eureka Seven in 2 days, catching up to Bleach by watching 7 hours a day, etc). But that's not really a good example of stuff, and perhaps not that healthy itself.

:)

So long you're having fun, it's all good.
>> ARTICLE
Usagi Drop is probably my favorite SoL, like ever. It's a fantastic show. 

As for Sakura Trick, you're entering the phase in which I started to abhor that show. Show, Yuri, whatever, I like it, but it starts to push in some really obnoxious drama that kind of goes against everything the show was prior. It tries to make nonsense yuri fanservice serious, and I really, really hate it.

I'm with ya on Usagi Drop. It was absolutely fantastic on every level.

White Album 2 is amazing isn't it?  Have you read ahead in the VN? (just read you did, oops)  It only gets...better.

...What do you mean by "better?"

I don't wanna spoil it for you because it seemed you enjoyed it, but WA2 is notorious for being a very depressing series so keep that in mind...

But when you read the VN summary, read the Touma End.  I consider that canon.

Still loved it.

Like I have said if they do the Touma ending I will cry like a fucking bitch so hard at the end scene.

I hope we are talking about the "true touma ending" and not the "normal" one.

Ugh. I watched all of WA2 about 2-3 months ago. I still feel physically ill when I think about the ending for too long. Even so, it's still one of my all-time favorites.

Its exactly the same for me. I just had to read the summary of the VN afterwards , because i couldnt accept this ending!

**Serial Experiments Lain** [(MAL)] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain) ****Completed**** In my attempt to watch some older shows and after seeing this one mentioned a lot I thought I would check it out. It was pretty amazing. It's sort of hard to wrap your head around if you aren't watching actively because some things aren't very explicit at times. It's a great watch through that has a lot to offer and if you haven't had a chance to watch it, I'd highly recommend it.

**Mawaru Penguindrum** [(MAL)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum) ****Completed**** Another one I'd seen mention around that I never had a chance to watch. The first thing you notice is how the vibrant show is. It's a fun ride that kept having twist and story you'd never expect to happen. It's rich in symbolism and focuses on themes of fate all centered around an endearing family. Also highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't watched it.


>> ARTICLE
If you haven't already, you should watch Revolutionary Girl Utena. It's an older show with the same director/scriptwriter as penguindrum. Definitely something you'd enjoy if you liked Lain and Penguindrum. 
>> ARTICLE
First I want to explain how I decided to have my ratings work.

A show gets a 10/10 if it's in my personal top 5 anime.  And a show gets a 9/10 if it's in my top 10.  So a show like Code Geass is in my personal top 5 now so it gets a 10/10.

So on to what I watched the past two weeks (for I missed last week):

1. **Code Geass R1/R2 (50/50):** I regret not watching this sooner.  After I got over the weird character models I throughly enjoyed this show.  The badass MC has always been my weak spot and Lelouch might be the baddest of MC's.  Suzaku is was also a very interesting Antagonist type character, and the pay off at the end with [](/s "him and Lelouch working on Zero Requiem was amazing.  Like Lelouch said "Together, we could do anything".  I also am of the belief Lelouch lived and is traveling with CC as a peddler, both immortal.  But I could live with him being dead as well")  Code Geass gets a **10/10**.

2. **Golden Time (24/24):**  I enjoyed it mostly until the end.  Too much shit and non closure.  If [](/s "they were going to milk the Banri loses his memories of everyone since you have been watching, then don't do the cop out thing and have him remember Koko from just the mirror.  Irritating.  I am waiting for a show where the female lead and the male lead do break up but both are better for it because they grew as people so much.  Much like Kokoro Connect did with Inori and Tachi.  Also the fact that Linda, my favorite character, got that weak ass ending was disappointing, along with the fact Misuo and Chinami's thing never got resolved.  Stop trying to make MitsuoxLinda happen.")  Golden Time gets a **6/10**

3. **Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (24/24):** Same as Golden Time though I enjoyed it more.  Enjoyed the humor and most of the characters, especially Nanami.  Loved Nanami to death.  Sad she got kind of a bad ending and never truely told [](/s "Sorata how she felt")  The main romance was honestly not very good, though it wasn't horrible.  Misaki and Jin's romance was amazing.  Characters grew as the show went, so I enjoyed it.  I gave Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo a **7/10**

4. **Clannad/Clannad:AS (47/47):** You know, I thought Clannad was overhyped.  I thought I wouldn't enjoy it, or be moved by it as much as people were saying I would.  Good god I was wrong.  I have seen a few complaints about the characters not being deep enough for people and I can see that, but I enjoyed it and especially thought Tomoya's character was very good in Clannad and became downright amazing in Clannad:AS.  Nagisa was honestly very bland in Clannad but I feel as though her character was amazing in Clannad:AS.  When Clannad:AS hit it's main arc in episode 16 when [](/s "Nagisa dies in Childbirth...I think my eyes were watering for 6 episodes straight.  Ushio's scene in the field was a downpour.  I cannot put into words how tragically beautiful the ending episodes of Clannad:AS are.  After reading up on the ending and understanding it I believe it is a beautiful ending as well for the fact they have had magic in the series the whole time it makes it feel like it isn't a cop out.  I want to point out I would've been equally moved if Tomoya got his life back together with Ushio and moved on from Nagisa with Kyou instead, but the ending it has is more than fine.")  Clannad got a **8/10**.  Clannad:AS got a **10/10**.
 
5. **White Album 2 (12/12):** Beautiful.  Straight up [](/s "tragically") beautiful.  All the characters were wonderfully deep, wonderfully flawed, and wonderfully real.  I actually liked all the characters and the [](/s "airport scene at the end basically crushed me emotionally.")  The music was also amazing.  I also read ahead in the VN and [VN spoilers](/s "if they go with the Touma route with a continuation of the anime adaption, I will automatically bump it up to my #1 anime of all time.  Because good god I would cry like a fucking bitch at that ending.") White Album 2 gets a **10/10**.

6. **Nisemonogatari (3/11):** It is nice, I like it so far a little bit more than Monogatari, and I am eagerly awaiting the tooth brush scene.  I am going to keep going for I have heard Monogatari:S2 is good, though I am enjoying Nise.

7. **The World God Only Knows S1 (8/12):** Really enjoying it.  The MC was honestly annoying in the beginning parts but he is getting better since the Kanon arc and it seems it finally is affecting him emotionally that these girls don't remember him.  The filler episodes are kind of annoying though.  Also, what is the order of this show?  It seems like it's a wonky order you are supposed to watch it in.

Damn that took a while.  Hope you enjoyed my thoughts.
>> ARTICLE
So... in a week you watched 3 shows that went straight to your top 5. That's very... good, or bad, depending on the perspective. What are the other 2, just out of curiosity?

Of the shows I watched, I kind of agree with everything you said, though I actually think Sakurasou is better than Clannad season 1. It touches some really deep subjects that Clannad just doesn't do.
>> ARTICLE
Well I have just started watching anike in the past month.  And this was also the last three weeks of watching shows for I missed last weeks thread.

The other two are TTGL and Angel Beats.

Hm. Point of parliamentary inquiry: When you fill out your List to the 100+ range, will you keep scoring in such a restrictive fashion or will you allow more scores of 9s and 10s to exist? 

I'm not complaining. Gods know I've got my own hard-and-fast rules for a perfect 10/10 score, and it is still well under 5% of my 326 completed shows... Yet there are still eleven of them, and I think I would have been driving myself absolutely crazy if I absolutely had to pick six titles to demote.

Man after [That,](/s "Nagisa's death, it truly felt like someone important was missing from the show;") it was just so hard to continue with the series.

I'm watching Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo as well. I just finished 16 episode. I just love it. My best character is Nanami too. I like relationship Sorata x Nanami. Relationship Jin x Misaki is very sad for me. I'm looking for anime like this.

for TWGOK, IIRC it goes S1, S2, 4-Nin to idol OVA, Tenri arc OVA, S3


>> ARTICLE
The 4-Nin to Idol OVA doesn't need to be watched, but the Tenri Arc HAS to be watched before you start watching season 3. It sets up the whole plot of season 3.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, but if you wait until youre done with the 3rd season to watch it it sucks because youre going back to how the relations between the characters where before, which are much worse imo
>> ARTICLE
That's true, but some people don't like watching OVA's. I was only saying it because it is essential to the plot, so you would be confused if you didn't watch either of them.
>> ARTICLE
**Gurren Lagann (1-12)** I finally got around to watching it. I'm loving the mecha and the fight scenes, but a lot of the characters really get on my nerves. 

**Mushishi (10-13)** I have been slowly watching this show for a little while now. It's good, but it's not a show I feel like I should be rushing through. 

**Shinsekai Yori (1-9)** Really enjoying this show so far. If things keep on track, it should have good character development and an interesting plot all the way through. 


>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann will hit insane hype soon, go for it!

Shin Sekai Yori: A lot of people felt a bit put-off by it, but I think its a fantastic science-fiction story. Its focus is on world-building and asking questions, a little less on the characters (although that is there). Keep in mind that its based off of a novel, and so it has the pacing of one, and like many novels its about the build-up to the finale. The questions that the children ask at all stages of their development, remember them and keep questioning.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate, and by god do I regret not watching it sooner. It is the best series I've watched so far, and I'll probably end up rewatching it at some stage in the future. I do agree that it starts off slow, but I believe the series ended off better as a result. The characters were perfect, the story was fantastic and the ending was really satisfying. I couldn't have asked for anything more, and I'm glad I watched it.

**[Sukitte Ii na yo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14289/Sukitte_Ii_na_yo.) (Say "I love you") episodes 1-13+OVA (Complete):**

First, I'll talk a wee bit of production. I liked the voice actors, that Kurosawa Yamato played the main role (he's Suzaku from Code Geass, Makishima from Psyco-Pass, and most importantly) which stands clear in my memory lately for this exact voice as Fakir in Princess Tutu, combined with [how much the OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHR24MZUGy0) reminded me [of Princess Tutu's OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH0ULZZScJQ) as well, and the piano music playing everywhere, I was predisposed to liking it.

Character designs are nice, if simple. Backgrounds are lovely. Animation? The whole series probably has less animation than a single episode of Free! or something. Almost everything is a still shot, or a single limb moving. Scenes where we see characters' full bodies as they walk are often awkward as hell.

Well, with that out of the way, let's get to the good stuff, the story.

This is a shoujo manga adaptation, and reads as one. If you like shoujo romances, I think you'll like this one. If you don't, or wish for harems, then you won't. It's pretty darn standard, guys.

The heroine is a close cousin to Hachiman from OreGairu - got harmed in the past, and now decides she doesn't need people. But damn, the first episode covered so much ground. Compared to all the premiers that take 2-3 episodes to get *anywhere*? This show more or less starts with the two main characters becoming a couple, and then slowly growing closer, and then running into the issues that a real couple might run into. Yes, [spoilers](/s "saying "I love you" out loud is somewhat "The payoff" at the end"), but it's not a "Will they, won't they?" but "*How* will they deal with this? How will they deal with themselves?"

I really liked a couple of bits that felt super-real, such as sending an SMS, and the other side replying too late. And then people slow-cook in their own thoughts, dwelling, and things escalate. If anything, the main thing I've found unrealistic about the show was how when both sides got hurt, and in turn hurt the other,[spoilers](/s  "everything was resolved by both sides just coming clean and trying to resolve things"). This sort of thing *does* happen, and is indeed the best way to solve things. But it takes time to get there. All too often, especially early on, the urge to hunker down and only hurt the other side more kicks in. That bit of shounen RomComs is frustrating to watch, but it's realistic.

The plot-points are often pretty standard, "Get boy and girl together, boy is popular so deal with disapproval from others, make friends, deal with boy potentially dating other girls, then girl gets advancements made on her," but honestly, if you're looking for something "different", than most romance stories are the *last* place you should look. Yes, it's "comfort-food", and I'm fine being comforted by it.

The one thing that *did* stand out to me? The male MC. If you break it down, his "noble and will sacrifice himself for others" is actually something that appears in a lot of shoujo mangas, due to, well, how *idealized* they are. He's something of a "bad boy", and it's interesting how shoujo fit the two together. So what stood out to me? How much they took it to its logical conclusion. [Spoilers] (/s "This dude slept with a girl who felt down in order to make her feel better.") He truly did *everything* to make others happy. If anything, he reminds me of Araragi from _monogatari. Minus the lewdness, but with the "I will sacrifice myself to help others!" and how that actually makes everyone around him sad, especially those he helped.

And of course, if he helps everyone, it made the romantic interest less sure of herself and how "special" she is to him and so, which is natural.

I also liked the OVA. The final episode of the series was the funniest one, to me. The OVA just had side-characters gain more time, but still as a drama.

This show is probably a 6/10 in terms of quality - it's a perfect boilerplate example of a well-executed shoujo. I will give it **7/10** because I've enjoyed it quite a bit. Was fun to marathon in the middle of the week.
>> ARTICLE
What was your opinion on the female main character? I really didn't like her. All she could do is blush, I think we'd gotten literally nowhere if it weren't for the male MC. If you compare her to other shoujo MC's, she's by far the most annoying in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
A passive MC who does nothing is not annoying, because there are no acts to be annoying, but you're annoyed by them.

Hmmm. What do I think of her?

As a character, or as a person? I think in both cases, I liked her fine. As a person, she let things bottle inside, she avoided confrontations, as most of us would, and then things would burst out once people prodded her to share. That's actually... *realistic*. No, not everyone's like that, but many people have an *aspect* like that, and I've known a fair number of shy/hurt people who were even more recalcitrant with sharing their feelings than her.

Moreover, we did know what she's thinking and feeling. This is a shoujo romance, not a shounen action show. "I think" or "I feel" in such shows are just as important as people actually taking out actions in the outside world. We see things from her perspective, so while others act, she's allowed to tell us via thinking, and reflecting, and questioning herself. That's part of the genre.

Now, as a character. As a character, if the above isn't sufficient, she's both "main character" and "Supporting character" at the same time - others' actions reflect on her, via her thoughts and in the end pushing her to act. Also, when she decides to *not* act - it's an action. Each time she said nothing but felt sadness inside? It's an act. Not saying anything when you have nothing to say isn't an action. When you have something to say and stop it, it *is* a worthwhile act, that ups the stakes.

Yes, in my old relationships, such behaviour often led to trouble, but that both made it more realistic, and in the narrative, it moved things along even as "nothing changed", because *tension* rose.

Finally, as a "supporting character", she got others to act, via her silences, via her feelings, and her outbursts.

I might have not liked being in a relationship with her, but as a character in a narrative, and a person we can empathize with? I liked her fine.
>> ARTICLE
Looking at it that way, I can't say I disagree. To be honest I hadn't thought about doing something by *not* doing anything, to put it simply. Thank you for the trouble of typing all that, it's nice seeing a character who left a negative impression the first time in a somewhat more positive light.
>> ARTICLE
Just keep that in mind, when in politics someone speaks of "restraint", or when you're in a relationship and the other side tells you "Nothing" when you ask them what they want to do/what the problem is ;-)

More seriously, glad I was able to provide an alternate take on things.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly, many people don't share the same ability to be introspective and open like you. I wholeheartedly agree with tundranocaps about Mei and her characterization, but I've seen many people who simply don't understand the story being told. My only working theory is that the average anime fan simply doesn't have the breadth of social experience necessary to "get" the characters/plot of Sukitte Ii na yo. It's definitely the type of show that if you've experienced something similar in real life (or even know someone who has) you will relate to it much better.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion (26/26, End of Evangelion)**

Dafuq man. I love it.

Such a good series.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion (5/26)**

First of all, yes...I haven't seen NGE yet and no, I have an actual home, not just a rock.

This week I was finally able to overcome my reluctance to all things Mecha in order to watch NGE. And boy, I'm glad I did. After pretty much marathoning the original Sailor Moon, I've been seriously itching to sink my teeth into something complex once again.

I came in expecting it to be maybe 70% mecha fights/technobabble with the other 30% for the much lauded psychological drama. So far, the ratio seems to be more like 10:90 which makes me a very happy panda.

Each episode is so packed with things relevant to the psychology of the characters that I find myself pausing every 2 minutes or so just to let them sink in and find a place for those individual jigsaw pieces in the grand scheme of things. I absolutely love what I'm getting so far. 

Perhaps my only criticism is that some of the psychology (particularly with Shinji) feels almost Freudian, which is personally something I'm not a huge fan of. 
>> ARTICLE
You gon' like iiiiit.

I only watched it this past year and it instantly shot to among my favourite series ever. 

Watch the TV episodes, and then the ending movie End of Evangelion.

The Rebuild of Evangelion movies are for after all that.
>> ARTICLE
Wait till episode 25/26. Bam!
>> ARTICLE
The psychology is very much Freudian, and it only gets more-so as you keep going, and then look back on the series. Sure, there could be a dose of Jung in the end. But it's got Freud writ large all over it.
>> ARTICLE
Make sure to watch The End of Evangelion once you finish episodes 25 & 26.  Then if you want you could watch the 3 rebuild movies (you could probably skip the first since it's basically a recap of the first few EVA fights but much MUCH prettier).
>> ARTICLE
Rebuild 1.0 is still one of my favorite just for all that sweet mecha battles. Just don't get me started on 3.0.. =_=
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know a lot of people don't really like 3.33 but I guess I'm in the minority.  I really liked all 3 movies with 2 probably being my favorite.  Three was really good because of how the trailer threw everyone off and made them forget that they were still watching EVA and EVA doesn't do typical mech things haha.
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching **Psycho-Pass (9/24)** and **Knights of Sidonia (7/12)**.



Psycho-Pass has been really great. The setting is really creative for cyberpunk (although most cyberpunk settings have pretty interesting concepts), and all of the characters are really interesting. I think what I like most about it are the various villains. 




Knights of Sidonia is basically Attack on Titan in space in a lot of ways, but I'm finding it surprisingly enjoyable. I think the animation during some battles could use some work, but otherwise the different animation style isn't bad. What I like most about it is the setting, and I think that Izana is best bigender right now. [Knights of Sidonia](/s "Also, when that chick peed in the guys mouth, I couldn't help but laugh. I know it was filtered and necessary to live, but I just couldn't help it.")

[Here's a link to the Psycho Pass book club/recommended reading list](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/07/10/join-the-psycho-pass-book-club), if you're interested! I'm aiming to finish all of the books on the list before season 2 airs.

Thanks. Funnily enough, I am reading 1984 right now.
>> ARTICLE
I really wanted to enjoy Knights of Sidona but something about the animation style is really off putting to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I understand. Personally I don't really like the gauna design, but I got used to the animation outside of the fight scenes pretty quickly.
>> ARTICLE
I'll give it another try I think. Is this something I could watch at a workplace without much problem? I accidentally started Tokyo Ghoul at work without reading up so I'm a little gun shy.

There are a few fanservicey scenes with Barbie Doll nudity and a bunch of girls in their underwear. 
>> ARTICLE
**Aku no Hana**

it is... strange. It really is extremely odd, though that's not bad, im liking it
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the Aku no Hana anime itself is vastly overshadowed by it's art style. The manga is seriously amazing, but a lot of people can't say much about the anime besides "huh, this is weird", usually only talking about the visuals. Granted, it is a weird story, but I feel like the oddness, massage, and tone of the story are sidelined due to the visuals of the show. 

>> ARTICLE
yeah, that might happen a lot, although after 11 episodes it isn't actually noticable anymore for me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the middle of **Stein's Gate** right now and loving it. All of the characters are awesome and work very well together. They are a major highlight of the series for me. Halfway through shit starts to hit the fan and it is done pretty well. I can't believe I haven't watched it before.
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching Fate Zero.

I went through all available Fate Kaleid before that. It is what got me interested.

LOVED Fate Kaleid and I'm really like Zero so far.
>> ARTICLE
Kaleid is just a comedy spinoff of a couple of characters of the Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night series, other than that there is no relation. Like, it's just so different, but still Fate/Zero is incredible. 
>> ARTICLE
As a Fate/Stay Night fanboy, the order you're experiencing the series in physically wounds me. I guess it's okay if you enjoy it though.

**Hunter x Hunter (2011) (1-58)** 
Tried to decide between HxH and Fairy Tail as my shounen of choice. Ended up picking HxH and lets just say that I'm enjoying it a lot. Watched all of the Phantom Troupe arc in one sitting. Paused a bit at 58 which was the end of the arc but going to be going back on track today. 


**Kiss x Sis TV (1-10)**
I don't know why. Maybe it was because HxH just didn't have many females. It's... pretty boring. I planned to drop it but I keep coming back for "one more episode".


EDIT: **The Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi (1/1)**
Totally forgot that I watched this! For a franchise that I didn't particularly love, this movie was amazing. I'm actually planning to watch a lot of anime movies in the next week so I can participate properly in the movie ranking game. I've got a lot of catching up to do right now since I've hardly seen any (I haven't even seen Princess Mononoke) but I have planned to watch Summer Wars tonight. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't really want to diss Fairy Tail and I wouldn't call it bad, but you can't compare it to the masterpiece that is HxH. You made the right choice. Watch Fairy Tail only after you exhausted your other top shounen options. 
>> ARTICLE
I second this, Fairy Tail is a fun watch but nothing like HxH in terms or plot or fight quality.
>> ARTICLE
**Legend of the Galactic Heroes**
I'm on episode 11 so far. I like the premise and the characters already have a lot depth to them. I just find it hard to watch a lot of episodes at once because it is a thoughtful anime that if I were to watch more than like three episodes at a time, it would overwhelm me. That sucks because I really want to finish it before school starts except I don't know if I will
>> ARTICLE
I have been meaning to ask. Where can someone watch, stream, or rent "LoGH?"  I have been an anime collector since 93 and have never encountered a legit translation (or even a fansub) though I haven't looked years. 

(No "Google Torrents" recommendations please)

I'm pretty sure the only way to watch it is 'illegally' because its not licensed

There is no legit translation, the best one I've found is the version on uploaded to Youtube actually(if that is still there.)

**[Acchi Kocchi](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=8890) 6/13**

Moe/comedy/4-koma, with a little romance and surprise catgirls.  Simple and relaxing.

**[Urusei Yatsura](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=377)  195/195, 1/1 (tv specials) 1/6 (movies) 0/12 OVAs**

This has been my "watch it on my phone / tablet when I some free time" series for over 2 years, and I've finally finished the main series.  Now, going for the rest of it.  Classic screwball comedy.  And don't forget the [best girl](http://imgur.com/4sAQN97).

>> ARTICLE
**Blue Exorcist (25/25 + Movie)** - Again, watched this on a friend's recommendation, and honestly, and while I didn't hate it, it was just really generic shonen. Kid gets special powers that are different than everyone else's special powers, dead parent, goes to school while trying to hide the fact that he has special powers and fails, fight fight monologue friendship fight, not really too much to say about. The ending wasn't great, and it really didn't even accomplish anything in the long run of the series, but eh... I'd rate it a little above average for at least an interesting concept and not completely falling on it's face.

Oh, and the movie was okay, I suppose, but again, it really didn't leave any kind of impression on me at all.

**Katanagatari (12/12)** - That was an amazing show. The characterisation of every single person was possibly the best I've ever seen. Even the characters that only had maybe 5 minutes of screen time had a well defined and interesting personality. My only complaint about the series is exactly this, though. Because all the characters are set up to be incredibly fleshed out and interesting, I got really mad when so many of them just ended up being killed almost immediately. I'd love to see more of *any* character in this show, and that's saying a lot.

The final episode was fantastic, just like I've been told it was. [Katanagatari finale](/s "Seeing Sichika just destroy every sword effortlessly was so intense to watch. Seeing his true power, not bounded by his promises to Togame in the first episode, was astounding, and his final fight with Emonzaemon was my favorite part of the whole series."). 

Beyond those, I've watched the first episodes of **Baccano**, **Spice And Wolf**, and **Nagi no Asukara**, and the first two of **Hitsugi no Chaika**. None of them in particular really stood out to me, so I'm not sure which ones I'll start first, probably S&W or Chaika.

Lots of ridiculous antics and great jokes. One of the best mini-segments ever in the form of **High School Girls Are Funky**.

Looking forward to a very unlikely S2.

Solid **8/10**.
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching the second season of **Chihayafuru**, and it continues to astonish me how compelling this show is given its subject matter. There  are never long stretches between major tournaments, characters show clear growth in their gameplay and character arcs, and the show is doing an excellent job of introducing new characters. I love the continued emphasis on realism now extending to which players should play in team matches, and these matches are always exciting and novel.

Speaking of realism, I've also been watching **Knights of Sidonia** on Netflix. Its main problem - the CG character models - continues to be annoying, but less so now (5 episodes in) than it was at first, and the flipside is that space battles look great. [](/s "Sidonia accelerating") was brutal as hell, and seeing how scary a single Gauna is makes me excited to see more of them at once.
>> ARTICLE
**No Game No Life (12/12)**

I didn't watch this when it was airing, just because of a lack of time back then. I also didn't bother to pick it up until now, and I have to say I'm glad I did. Although it might not entirely deserve the ridiculously high rating it got on MAL (8.82, ranked #23 of all time) I get why people liked it. 

I liked it. It has fun characters and a really interesting world and story. The fanservice was a bit too excessive at times but I couldn't say it didn't match the show's atmosphere. It was well animated and the music was great, all in all a really fun show to watch. I as many others can't wait to see a second season and with the positive response it got it wouldn't surprise me if one would be announced.

**Bokura ga Ita (5/26)**

This is just my 'watch when I'm bored' shoujo anime. It's from 2006 and the art and all is a bit outdated and looks simple, but it works fine in the show as it's just a slow-paced shoujo romance. It has a great main character and even though some side-characters seem a bit plain, it works fine for this kind of show.  

The only problem is: Where are they going with this? In 5 episodes I must admit a lot has happened and I can't really see how they would fill another 21(!) episodes. If we'd compare it to something such as Kimi ni Todoke we'd be around the 20th episode already. I hope it won't get stretched out with a ton of fillers and nothing interesting happening. But, we'll see I guess.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the entirety of Golden Time.  I swear to god if I got a dollar every time someone said 'Tada' or 'Banri' id be a goddamn millionaire.  Overall I give the show an 8/10.  2-D kun will live on forever in the bro hall of fame.  I give the writers mad props on tearing me between the SS Linda and SS Koko.  Honestly couldn't decide which ship I liked more.  Ending was really mediocre though.
>> ARTICLE
**Chihayafuru** up to episode 9. I read the manga before and never started the anime, but I'm so glad. Perfect adaptation and the music/animation is amazing
>> ARTICLE
Didn't watch much this week. 

**Spice and Wolf** [13/13]

I remember watching this way back and then forgetting about it after episode 2. After watching the whole thing, I have to say that I loved it all the way through. This show makes bartering just as intense as balls to the wall action. 9/10
>> ARTICLE
Finished Steins;Gate, holy crap was that incredible.
>> ARTICLE
**Gintama** (31-36/201) - Amnesia plot was okay, didn't expect Kagura to be the most loyal of the lot but I think I'm underestimating her character overall. Shinpachi going on a date was my second favorite episode so far, but I didn't like the resolution of [Gintama Episode 35](/s "the woman being a thief.") I wanted them to play it straight for once and have things turn out well for a time. This batch of episodes made me like Otae more too.

More in the [Gintama discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2b5r0a/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_3136/cj22bdk) thread.

**Beck - Mongolian Chop Squad** (2-3/26) - The third episode finally got my attention, though its still pretty slow. 

Still less overall this week due to the **Fate/Stay Night** visual novel. But a question since it's relevant: after I complete that, is the original F/SN anime series or Unlimited Blade Works movie worth watching, or should I just go straight to Fate/Zero?
>> ARTICLE
I'm so fucking happy someone went with Fate in the correct order!!! You can watch UBW if you want to see the badass UBW fights animated (in fact, you could just watch from the Archer fight onwards). Fate/Zero is pretty good, hope you like it. Adds a lot of flavor to the original.
>> ARTICLE
If you're already reading the visual novel, there's not any point watching the original 2006 Fate/Stay Night anime as it doesn't do it justice really. The pacing and animation quality is not too bad, but it ends up trying to mix together bits of other routes (despite being predominantly the Fate route) in a manner that leaves much to be desired. I watched it before reading the VN and at the time it seemed decent, but I couldn't imagine enjoying it after having read the VN. 

The Unlimited Blade Works movie doesn't make much sense as a stand alone story, but it was basically made as a treat to VN readers by giving them a condensed version of that route (including the most important fights) in an animated form. Watching it is purely optional.

Fate/Zero is based on the prequel light novel(s?) written not by Nasu of Type Moon but by Gen Urobuchi and is one of his most famous works. If you're familiar with other works by "Urobutcher" then you know you can expect great things but it won't be all roses and cut and dried morals. You should watch this as soon as you finish the visual novel, Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night's VN both seem to spoil each other in certain plot elements but overall you could do it in either order.

Fate/Stay Night is getting an all new adaption this fall by the same studio that did Fate/Zero, so it promises to be very good and a huge improvement over the previous adaption unless they monumentally screw up. Rumor has it that it's going to be an original route that stands alone yet borrows from the 3 routes in the VN, others suggest that it might be the Heavens Feel route since it's the only one to not be adapted so far.
>> ARTICLE
Just go straight to Fate/Zero. Unlimited Blade Works might be worth watching, but general consensus is that the original F/SN anime isn't really worth the time.

I just watched [A Letter to Momo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10389/Momo_e_no_Tegami) last night.

Chuunibyo - (3\12)

I feel embarrassed watching it because it reminds me of when I thought I was totally cool and unique, and at the same time, I laugh at it because it nails it. I was pleasantly surprised at how funny it was. Also, Rikka is best girl

Himegoto - (2\12)

Half the reason I'm even watching this is because the troll subs had me dying from laughter (first two episodes, anyways), but I actually found the normal subs pretty cool. ^^^^^IswearI'mnotwatchingitjustfortraps:<

No Game No Life - (1\12)

Being honest, I can't get into it. Should I give the show another shot, does it pick up from the first episode, or does it just stay the same?
>> ARTICLE
Kimi Ni Todoke.  It was mentioned in another thread so I checked it out.  I ended up marathoning it this week.  I'm exhausted :)

It's a really sweet story about a girl who because of her resemblance to the ghost girl from "The Ring," is feared and shunned by her classmates.  She is noticed by a popular guy and a romance develops. 


I liked it  a lot, but all of the obstacles to them getting together started feeling pretty forced by the second season.

**2199 Yamato (20/26)**

I'm watching the remake and it's got a lot of things that I love from the sci-fi genre.  Feels like a great blend of Battlestar: Galactica, Stargate, and Star Trek.  I'm enjoying the plot a lot even though best girl is not winning.  I also really like how instead of the normal spaceship they're basically naval warships in space.  It made it unique and memorable especially the part with the [](/s "submarine").

I really recommend watching the original. The remake is fine on it's own, but, compared to the original, it's really really bad.

Have you seen the Universal Century (original) Gundam series? Please do.

The newly finished Gundam Unicorn & the soon to come Gundam The Origin take place in the same timeline as the original series (original, Zeta, Char's Counterattack etc). Unicorn was fantastic!! 

There's also the soon to be released Gundam Reconguista in G (written by the writer of the first series!!) that will take place in the faaar future of the Universal Century series.

I haven't watched UC yet, but I'll try to (it's hard finding a site that'll stream it)

I have seen Unicorn Gundam Ep. 1 & 2. I'll have to catch up on that.

Yeah, hearing about Reconguista made me go back and watch the seasons after Seed and Destiny. Age was OK, I didn't really like Build Fighters, and 00 was amazing.

**Death Note (All 37 episodes)** 

Decided on a whim to rewatch death note, since I hadn't seen it in years. I'm surprised that I forgot so many plot points. Was just as enjoyable as the first time. L is seriously the coolest.

**Mirai Nikki (1-2)**

Really enjoying this. For some reason, this anime was recommended in some context related to Mafia (party/forum game) years ago, but I never got around to watching it. I really like it and can see some sort of comparison there. Reminds me a bit of Liar Game and Death Note, which are some of my favorite story types. I'm a sucker for psychological battles (esp. 1 on 1, which is why I loved Liar Game and Death Note so much...if you have any recommendations based on this, please tell me!). Yuno sort of weirds me out..I don't know why she is so obsessed with Yukki but I love how she says the name Yukki. I sort of just love her voice actor. Eventually one of them is going to have to betray the other, and I suspect with Yuno having the Yukki diary, she will have a major advantage later on in the story. Will probably have made significant progress on this by next week, if not outright finished it.

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica (All 12 episodes)**

I'll be honest, I'm not completely sure how I felt about it. It was incredibly interesting. I'm not sure what I was expecting from the show, but it definitely wasn't that. It was very enjoyable however and the plot never left me bored. A problem I may have with it is if [](/s "Kyubey's race only intervened on earth in the first place for to counteract entropy, why did they come to earth in "Madoka's universe" because magical girls didn't turn into witches so the entropy wasn't counteracted...? unless I'm missing something.") Overall I'd give it an 8/10

**LuckyStar (1-1)**

Not much to say about this, I thought it was fairly enjoyable though, and I've heard the first episode is a weak spot so I guess I'll probably enjoy the show

**Gintama (1-2)**

Hilarious, so many episodes though. I think it'll be a show I'll just watch  every once in a while when I need a good laugh. It's too intimidating to marathon

**Nichijou (1-1)**

I remember watching a couple episodes of this a while back, so I started it back up. Again, not much to say but it's very funny.

**Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni (1-3)**

I watched this years and years ago and I remember liking it so I'm starting it back up again. I've forgotten pretty much everything but every so often I have a bit of memory come back and I can predict what's happening next because of that. Still, very enjoyable IMO.

**Baka to test (1-1)**

Hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
[Madoka Magica TV series](/s "In response to what's in your spoiler tag, Homura explains at the end of the series that just because Madoka prevented the formation of witches doesn't mean that human grief doesn't manifest. Instead, those wraiths form and personify despair, and the magical girls fight them. When destroyed, they drop those little stones that Homura "feeds" to Kyuubey, and it's implied that this gives them energy, though nowhere near as much as the witches used to").

**Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (26/26)** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex)


A few weeks back, I watched the 1995 Ghost in the Shell movie and loved it. After I got through a couple series that I wanted to watch first (Log Horizon, Chaika, etc.), I decided to watch GitS:SAC and loved it as well. It seemed like 2 or 3 episodes were filler, but were pretty good to watch because of the action (except for one where they literally sitting around a table and talking for 22 minutes). I gave it an 8/10 on MAL, but if I could do 0.5's, then I'd give it an 8.5/10.


**Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - The Laughing Man (1/1)** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2449/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex_-_The_Laughing_Man)


If you're strapped for time and don't want to watch 26 episodes, then this movie made a good summary of GitS:SAC. It's somewhat lengthy at 2 hours and 40 minutes. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
I'm also watching Usagi Drop 1-7. Most peaceful and heartwarming anime i've ever seen
>> ARTICLE
I've mostly been watching movies this week. I've also put in the english names just in case it's easier to search up.

**Sakasama no Patema:** or **Patema inverted:**

Boy this movie was a bunch of fun; it's a fun romance with a really *really* interesting world. It'll make your head spin with constant camera switches which always feel appropriate. I kind of want to watch it with my monitor upside down. [ ] (/s "lol")

**Byousoku 5 centimetre** or **5 centimetres per second**

I can not believe I've never watched this staple. It's so bittersweet it's ridiculous. [ending] (/s "this whole movie makes me so depressed seeing him being pushed away from a perfect romance but I can't help but feel happy seeing his smile at the very end knowing he's moved on.")

**Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei** or **The Garden of Sinners Movie 1**

This sound track is so based and the animation is godly. I'm really excited to see the rest of this story but I can't really say much considering I've only watched one of 7 movies and movie one starts about halfway into the full story.

**Shinsekai Yori 1-25:** or **From the New World 1-25**

This was the show that I devoted the most amount of time to this week. Although people say that the start is slow I've found that it kept a strong pace throughout although I seem to be alone on this. The job they did at world building was simply spectacular and I get chills watching it. Apparently it gets good after episode 11ish but I "loved" it throughout. Love in the way that it's a fantastic story and world but man it creeps me out.

**Yama no Susume 1-12** or **Encouragement of The Climb** AKA **Mountain Climbing Lolis (thanks commie!)**

Hooray, slice of life! I watched this not knowing that season 2 was coming around this season and I'm super excited that it is.(too bad subs are never coming out). I love slice of life shorts like aiura and this brought joy to my soul. 

>> ARTICLE
The CR subs are actually fairly decent for Yama no Susume Season 2. Then again, I never saw the Commie's subs. The ones I found for the first season were by a small group called Lazy Lily, but they're doing Hanayamata this season instead of YnS.
>> ARTICLE
The CR subs are taking forever; episode 2 aired last Wednesday and there's still no subs! The commie subs were pretty good although they called the show mountain climbing lolis for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai yori. Definitely a lot of intense vibes from this one. Not exceptionally dark but deeply unsettling in an Orwellian fashion. I also loved the fact that there was no OP. It felt tone appropriate and I'm glad that they didn't include one merely for the sake of having one. Overall, a fairly solid top 15 pick and I would be interested in seeing more of these kinds of stories.

**Turn A Gundam (completed)**

Well this was certainly different than any Gundam show I've seen before. For some background info, they say that when this series came out, Yoshiyuki Tomino was recovering from depression and wanted to do something that wasn't as dark as his previous installments in the franchise. Story wise it was there for being the most unique Gundam series to date but that doesn't do enough to hide its flaws. The series itself was a colony drop in failure. Pacing, acting, characters, animation, the script, ect ect ect. It felt like they never bothered to revise anything and just winged it the entire way through production. Would not recommend unless you're looking for a series that's trying to parody Gundam. The only highlight was seeing the character growth of both Kihel Heim and Dianna Soreil and their struggles to bring peace to both the Earth and Moon race.  

**Initial D Fourth Stage** (18-24)**

Aww yiss, more of Akina's best downhiller racer taking others to school. I know next to shit about cars but this series just keeps making street racing and cars in general so interesting. Would definitely recommend as alternate to the regular shounen sports that involve some kind of ball sport.

**Katanagatari:** A couple of my friends have been telling me to watch this for a few weeks. I couldn't see how it could be as good as they made it out to be but damn... What a good series. The quality of everything in it is incredible. I would recommend it, for sure.

**Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica: Rebellion (movie 3):** "What the fuck" was pretty much my reaction (although that's not surprising). It was closer to the style of the TV series than I thought it would be. The synopsis I read made it sound quite different. I didn't enjoy it as much as the show and I don't think it was as solid in some parts (although it's been a while since I've seen the series) but it was definitely good. [](/s "That ending though...")

**Toradora! (7/25):** Very enjoyable so far. I like the characters and am interested to hear the background stories for some of them.

Haven't posted anything like this before. Is it ok/pointless/etc?

I've decided that unless something is worth noting, I will leave unfinished shows blank, just showing the episodes I watched from the week. Example: Psycho-Pass this week.

**Psycho-Pass (5/22)** (Watched 3-5 this week)

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (17/27)** (Watched 14-17 this week)

**Ping-Ping The Animation (11/11)** (Watched 1-11 this week)

Really enjoyed this more than I thought I would. *'Blood tastes like iron'* was a fun phrase making references to Tsukimoto being 'robot-like' and boring. With Tsukimoto being the MC for the most part, I was [Spoilers](/s "a little disappointed with the ending since Tsukimoto becomes a teacher and Hoshino being on the Ping Pong team instead"). But overall, very fun and amazing for marathoning. Watched it in two days. 9.25/10.

**Gyo: Tokyo Fish Attack OVA**

What the fuck? If you haven't seen this... Don't. I mean, it wasn't that bad, but... there's so much better stuff to watch out there. As for the content on this, I'm usually desensitized to gore, but this made me sick to my stomach... from laughing at it so hard. It really does better as a comedy rather than a horror. Bland characters, meh storyline, don't bother unless you're a huge fan of gore.
	
**Fate/Zero S2 (1-7)** (Watched 1-7)

>> ARTICLE
I was satisfied with the ending, because the original goals shown of each of the characters made sense with the outcome. Smile was using Ping Pong as an enjoyable hobby and never wanted to see it as a competition. While Peco always wanted to be the #1 best Ping Pong player.
>> ARTICLE
That's true, but it always seemed to be like Smile was the main character. Maybe I'm just thinking about it wrong. I guess Peco really did want it more.

Currently rewatching Deadman Wonderland and sometime later tonight (once I finish it) I'm going to rewatch Chaos;HEAd.  But that might not be until after midnight so it don't count.

EDIT:  I also watched an episode of Mushibugyou and will try and watch more sooner or later.

**Katnagatari (12-12):**

This series was simply amazing, I loved how they pulled a bebob every episode where they introduced a colorful set of characters who feel fully fleshed out only to then replace them and move on to the next set. The episodic nature of the series was a little annoying at times because it made the series fairly predictable, that said we did get trolled and spoiled by the narrator a few times so that kindd of made up for it. Overall this series got a 10/10 from me but coming from someone who loved the monogatari series that's probably a little biased! My only complaint with the series was that haircut. GOD WHY NISIO ISIN!

**Ben-to** ***(completed)*** I started watching this anime this morning and I enjoyed it. It has a really unique concept of an anime (people fighting for half-price bentos).

**[Tokyo Magnitude 8.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6211/Tokyo_Magnitude_8.0)** Episodes 1-End(11):

This is the first anime to make me cry since Clannad. I picked it up after finding the dub on Youtube. The[] (/s "'big twist'") was pretty obvious, but figuring it out early didn't lessen the effect. It's worth watching if you haven't seen it yet. And the ED's really catchy.

Non Non Biyori (12/12)

The cutest shit I've ever seen. I vomited rainbows the entire time. Also very funny. Renge is the best thing of all time. I need more.

Btooom! (12/12)

This show was like Death Note, Battle Royale and something else put into one. Great stuff. Also got caught up with the manga and sadly found out it isn't being translated past chapter 69 right now and the raws for 70+ have been out for months soooo that kind of sucks...a lot.

Started watching **Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt (1-4)** today. Seems pretty funny so far. I usually prefer sub but I'm watching this in dub and it's really great. I'm looking to watch more of Gainax's work after. Really interested in FLCL and Gunbuster, but I can't find anywhere to watch Gunbuster. I want to watch New Getter Robo as well...

The only Mecha I've seen are NGE and TTGL, so could anyone reccomend some more to me? I really want to watch some more. I prefer over the top action ones like TTGL but any is fine.

/r/Gundam would like to have a word with you ;)

I would recommend Gundam 00 (pronounced "double-oh"). Its the first Gundam series made in HD and it. looks. amazing.

Great fight choreography, great action. I think you'll love it. 

Hit me up for more Gundam suggestions if you'd like.

Also, the current hype mecha show is Aldnoah.Zero (3 episodes in). It's by the same guy who wrote PsychoPass, Madoka Magica, and Gargantia (another mecha show).

If you manage to watch Gunbuster, make sure to watch it's sequel Diebuster.

**Shiki (22/22)**

Just straight up blazed through this one. I got really hooked on this one and I think when it comes to Mystery/Thrillers then this one is definitely one of the best. It is a show about vampires and human morals and the story is basically [small spoiler](/s "that the MC's are slowly trying to find out why people just keep dying all the time"). The OST fits perfectly with the creepy and mysterious tone of the show and the artstyle is... [well certainly unique](http://i.imgur.com/WricH.jpg).

Another thing that stood out to me was how misleading the first episode was because [Shiki ep.1 and ep.2 spoilers](/s "just the way this episode is presented is very different from the rest of the episodes. They introduce you a MC that just complaines about everything and pretty much hates everything except the guy that she has a crush on. She even stalks him and spies on him at night. My thoughts on the first half where basically "wow do I really have to deal with this bitch as a MC -_-" however she dies because of a sudden disease and that's basically what changes the way the story in this show is told. Instead of a single MC the story is now told from the perspective of a lot of different characters at once. Of course later on the focus shifts more on the actually MC's because of reasons but I still found it very interesting.")

I would say if you liked Higurashi or Monster then you should definitely check this one out.

**Kareshi Kanojo no Jijo/His and Her Circumstances:** Picture a highschool romance anime, directed by Hideaki Anno. I'm 18 episodes in right now, and this has to be one of the best romances I've ever seen. Every character feels fully fleshed out, without resorting to tired character archetypes. The character's decisions are realistic, and there's a great deal of psychological analysis into their motives. There's so much more I can say about this, but I'll cut it short and say that it's one of those shows that makes you wonder, why aren't there more anime like this?

**Serial Experiments Lain:** 7 episodes in, and I'm ... not really sure what's happening. So Lain's classmate dies, she gets interested in computers, and then ... things happen. I like the tone of the show so far, but I feel I'd enjoy it a lot more if I understood the significance of every scene.

Did I finish Trigun this week? Can't remember. Anway, **Trigun:** This show was brilliant. It started off slow, just looking like goofy fun, but by the time the Gung-Ho guns started showing up, it got really good. You could really feel for Vash, when he desperatly wanted to save as many lives as possible. My biggest problem is that I don't feel that the back story was sufficiently explained. What is the deal with the plants? And [Vash] (/s "obviously isn't human, but what is he?") Overall, this series easily fits into my top 10.

**Revolutionary Girl Utena (29/39):**

Been working my way through this series for the past week or so. It's kind of slow-moving at times, but I'm really digging the visual and narrative style. 

This is a show that treats itself more like a stage than a camera lens. The chorus of shadow puppets interjecting [oblique commentary](http://imgur.com/a/4MK37) into every episode; the parallel or straight-up repeated scenes from one episode to the next; the surreal imagery that pops up all over the place, but [especially where the student council hangs out](http://imgur.com/a/NMaKk) -- Utena is very self-consciously telling a story, as opposed to showing events that are ostensibly "real".

Although, all the artsy thematic development and subtext notwithstanding, my favorite episode so far has got to be [spoiler](/s "Nanami trying to come to terms with the fact that she's apparently laid an egg.") Good times.
>> ARTICLE
**Psycho Pass (22/22)**

Started watching the re-release that's airing currently, but found out that the promised "extra content" might not really be worth waiting weeks on end for. So, that being said I started watching the original series and after a bit of a slow start ended up marathonning the whole thing this weekend. A real piece of work, this series. Equal parts amazing and disturbing, the whole fascination with utilitarianism and its ruthless cruelties as well as sick twisted tragedy in general is classic Urobutcher at his best.

**Shuffle!** It's my brother's favorite anime and has pressured me for years to watch this show since he loves it so much. I have a general disdain for Harems because not everyone can win, not to mention I'm a sucker for a straight up OTP Romance. 

I'm on ep 3/24 and so far it's "eh" I'm hoping it improves. 
>> ARTICLE
**Hyouka - Completed** To be perfectly honest i'm not a fan of the mystery genre in any form, and Hyouka hasn't changed that, but it is now my favourite slice of life anime i've seen. Great writing, realistic characters, fantastic animation and by far the best school festival arc in any anime. Why is there no festival arcs like this! We get to see most of whats going on in the school through multiple perspectives, the clubs, the competitions, running booths, i want more of this!

**Baka to test - Completed (both seasons + ova)** - So a couple of weeks ago i decided to go back and watch some of my favourite comedies to see if they held up (so far yes, they have). While i didn't burst into laughter at every other joke i found it overall enjoyable, though some of the characters did annoy me immensely (Himeji and Shimuzu) their jokes fell flat and they felt more in the way of best girl. I found scenes far less enjoyable when Himeji played a part, her character was shallow (not to see other characters are exactly deep) and pretty much bog standard Mary Sue.

**Horizon In the middle of Nowhere - 9/13 (1st season)** So i have been looking for something a bit more fun and adventurous lately, while the adventure aspect hasn't really begun, it has been building to it and has been an incredibly enjoyable ride so far. Aside from an almost annoying amount of exposition and tits the size of continents, the world and characters are interesting and likable. I love the fact that they've not just adapted our world into a fantasy/sci-fi setting but made it in a way that feels unique, they have their own quirks and lingo that is easy to understand, and i like that they are just letting things like the dolls or the interpretation of student councils exist without deep explanation of why. More shows should let the viewer discover the world, i like being confused for the first few episodes while i try to figure out how shit works in this world.

Anyway a side note, last season i decided to drop everything at episode 2 after i figured out i didn't like watching things week to week. I couldn't feel a connection to the characters that way, i finished most of last season not too long ago and enjoyed some of the shows (NGNL, Bokura Minna, Nanana's treasures) more than i thought i would. But there were shows that i don't think worked as well in a marathon. This season i've been watching Space Dandy and Sword Art Online weekly and i'd like suggestion for other shows that won't hold up in marathon form, it'd be a great help!

Oregairu (1-13): Definitely one of my top 10 series. Characters are very well fleshed out and likable, the humor is superb, and the drama didn't feel forced at all (unlike certain other series [](/s "kokoro connect")). Season 2 can't come soon enough

Nisekoi (1-11): Solidly entertaining, it's not some ground breaking masterpiece, but it's perfect just the way it is
>> ARTICLE
I watched **Another** and i've just started watching **The World God Only Knows**. **Another** gave me the creeps and **The World God Only Knows** seems pretty generic as a comedy haremish sort of anime. I think its entertaining, but i hope it picks up a bit more. I can't imagine it not picking up considering it has two more seasons that follow it
>> ARTICLE
**Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 (11/11)** Well, if nothing else, this was far and away the most *realistic* anime I completed this week. I found myself a bit irritated at the extras in the first few episodes being all-around rude to everyone, but after the intial two (three?) episodes we got to see more of the better sides of people. And then the depressing happens.

**Hamatora The Animation (12/12)** Basically, I saw the second season coming was airing in Summer and thought to myself "I wonder if this is worth watching?". I ended up with a definitive "eh, sure. Why not?" Its one of those shows that I'm continuing to watch not because of its plotline (which took a few episodes to really get into) but because its fun to watch. 

**Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku (13/13)** I just finished this within the past hour. This will likely be random ramblings. This will problably have more **spoilers** than the other two. 

Overall, I felt this was a fine show. We get to see Shu discover the working of a barren world dominated by war, where the soldiers operate on fear and what slim hopes of a good future they have left (its never really explained how Lala-Ru managed to get to Shu's world in the first place, although we do get to see how she was followed).

Speaking of Shu, I feel like he didn't change much throughout the course of the show. I somewhat feel like he should have changed given what happened, but at the same time, given his personality, it makes sense that he didn't. However, while Shu doesn't really seem to change his ways, the characters around him sure do, as Nabuca slowly begins to realize the things about the world he's fighting in. Also, Lala-Ru has no emotion and Hamdo is absolutely high on the crazysauce. 

I feel like I was going to write more than that, but its 1am and I did not get enough sleep last night. So to conclude, it wasn't a masterpiece, but it was good. I can see myself coming back to re-watch it sometime, eventually.

**Gintama: 1-6**

Seems like an enjoyable show so far with some good laughs. I hope the laughs pick up though like I've heard. I've heard that after the first twenty or so episodes the show really picks up so I'm gonna keep going. Wish me luck.

**Zatch Bell: 1-14**

Don't ask me why. It's a show I used to watch as a kid and now I'm just rewatching for the hell of it. Except the sad part is that it had such a good concept but was executed so poorly. The voice acting (dubbed) is so bad I cringe sometimes. The plot is only ok and the animation would have been better with some of today's animation style. If Zatch Bell was made in this year I feel like it would have been 10X better. Anyone else watch it?

Nisekoi 

Not finished (11/20) very clich, but honestly i dont really care, its heart warming and the characters very enjoyable, I will give 8/10.

**Steamboy** - Majestic visuals, breathtaking animation, interesting alternate history take. It was trying very hard to be a whimsical fantastical action adventure, but it lacked a certain *je ne sais quoi*. The most impressive theme that ran throughout the movie was the question "what is science for?". For profit, for the pure discovery of laws of the natural world, to make people happy, or to strengthen your nation? But the exploration of the theme takes a backseat to wildly ridiculous but exhaustively entertaining action. 7/10

**Golgo 13 - The Professional** - The plot itself is straightforward tale of a stoic seemingly emotionless hitman and a father out for revenge. But it was told with a psychedelic, almost crazy and schizophrenic sort of artistic style that was interesting to watch. The director or the editor really had fun with this post-production, and it shows. Weird cinematic angles, strange cut-ins, action scenes only shown in silhouette, bizarre choices like having character portraits multiply, expand and dance around the screen as they talk on the phone. A competently made and well directed OVA that could have been easily mediocre, considering its straightforward story. 8/10

**Hurricane Polymar - Holy Blood** - Polymar OVA based off the original series. Character design by the guy who also did Kite and Mezzo Forte... his art style is very distinct. It's directed by Shinbo, but the only other thing of his I've seen is Madoka and this is nothing like that. It's a rather flaccid action show with annoying comic relief side characters who adds nothing to the "story". The "story" is 100% turn-your-brain-off material, with unnecessary sexual fanservice. The tone deviates wildly from the dumb slapstick humor with the comic relief characters to the grim and gritty, dark action scenes where people get their heads ripped off and blood and gore flies everywhere. Tonal whiplash like crazy. The fight scenes aren't even that particularly well animated, considering its just a 2 episode OVA. I did enjoy it overall, for visceral and not intellectual reasons, and its not really recommended unless you just want a dumb action show. 6/10

**Katanagatari**

I just finished this one, and it is instantly one of my all time favorites. The originality and art-style, the characters and the world they were written in, the light-heartedness that times its dramatic moments with such expertise. Everything about this show just screamed masterpiece to me. The final episode may also be one of the greatest closing episodes I have EVER seen in any anime. Well done.

**Uchouten Kazoku**

I'm around halfway for this anime. So far, I am loving every second. The character writing is always colorful and interesting, and the aesthetic quality of the show is off the charts and never ceases to give us some of the most beautiful shots we can find in all of anime. I have always kind of been a sucker for shows that feature interesting people to follow in their daily lives and this one definitely fits the bill while still adding more and more at every turn. However, I can understand how this may not be for everyone due to it's heavy lack of engaging linear plot lines.

**Hunter x Hunter 2011 (100ish-138)** 

This show surprised me like I never thought it could. It's up there with my favorite anime. Give it a watch if you haven't. Killua is a beast. Honestly, my only problem was the [Arc name spoiler](/s "Chimera Ant") Arc having a slow start, but it was totally worth it and it became my favorite arc of the show thus far. 9.5/10, wish I could go into hibernation until Tuesday.

**One Piece (1-9)**

In wake of my depression after getting caught up to HxH, I started this. It's pretty cool so far. Luffy isn't just a dumbass like he came off, and I like the art style of the show, dunno why people actively dislike it. I understand vast shonen like this have slow starts but it's not pulling me in very much. Usopp is kind of annoying, but I'll get used to him. 7/10, but will probably get better.

**Trigun (5-7)**

I started this anime a few months ago and while it was good, I was busy with school. I ended up putting it on hiatus. I was pleasantly surprised how it was very approachable still. So far, Vash is a rad character, who's turning out to be more complex than face value. 8/10, will most likely finish this up this week.

As I haven't been home during Sundays for quite a while I've missed a lot of these threads so too make up for it I'll post for the last three weeks here.

#30th of June - 6th of July

I finished a lot of the spring seasons series as they were on their last run this week but I also started and finished some other series.

**Ookiku Furikabutte** 25/25 - Man baseball series never disappoint, I think the reason baseball always comes out so interesting is because it's easy to be creative with while the sport is simple enough to quickly understand yet complex enough to keep interesting. Ookiku Furikabutte did a good job with the baseball scenes overall and I liked Abe's character a lot but Mihashi was extremely off putting.

**Hataraku Maou-sama** 13/13 - Finally got around too finishing this, a good watch well worth the time invested in it.

**Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya** 6/10 - The show is decent..... I guess. Nothing outstanding but not bad either.

**Chihayafuru** 3/25 - I felt like starting this up as it's supposedly very good, hasn't quite gotten into it yet but who knows about the future.

#**Hyouka** 3/22 - I got this feeling during an evening that I had to watch Hyouka and the time to do that was now and as such I began.

#7th of July - 13th of July

This week wasn't a very active one for me aside for one day in specific where we had an anime evening.

**Hyouka** 22/22 - While I did enjoy Hyouka quite a lot (especially the culture festival arc) I do feel like it's slightly overhyped around here but it was a good show nonetheless and the characters were all great.

**Tonari no Totoro/My Neighbour Totoro** 1/1 - Was a neat watch and definitely a feel good movie until I read the dark version of it which was quite intriguing all be it a very far fetched fan theory.

**Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi/Spirited Away** 1/1 - So as you might've guessed by now I wasn't very much of an expert on Miyazaki so I hadn't seen a lot of the things he'd done. Spirited Away was one of them but damn am I glad I watched it. Such a great movie!

**Mononoke Hime/Princess Mononoke** 1/1 - I was expecting this to be Miyazaki's best for some reason, slightly disappointed but still pretty decent.

**Kaze Tachinu/The Wind Rises** 1/1 - Not one of the Ghibli masterpieces exactly but it was really beautiful, a bit slow in my opinion though.

#**N.H.K ni Youkoso** 14/24 - I'll eventually get to finishing this I guess, quite a good comedy with an interesting set of characters.

#14th of July - 20th of July

**Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya** 10/10 - I think the series was decent, I'll probably get to watching 2wei eventually but I'm not expecting any wonders exactly.

**Cowboy Bebop** 26/26 - Never got around to finishing Bebop before but finally did, overall a nice watch but not as good as people make it out to be.

**Trigun** 26/26 - A bit too repetetive for my taste but I managed too finish it atleast even if just to say that I did.

**Sankarea** 12/12 - I started this a while ago and then put it on ice but finally finished it, a bit of a shame because I loved the introduction to the series and thought it was gonna be really good but ended up being so-so at best.

**Fate/Stay Night** 17/24 - Really enjoying this thus far, I figured I'd watch F/SN and then rewatch F/Z too see if it raises my opinion of F/Z, Saber is a really nice character now that she's getting some development. I did read on MAL someone saying F/SN was like "A 24 episode series with the animation budget of a 12 episode series and the storyline of a 36 episode series". And I'm starting too see what they meant.

**One Piece (1-40):**

I decided that if I was ever gonna catch up to this anime it would be now. So far I have loved it. I have watched at least 3 episodes of it every day so I'll be fully caught up sometime in February 2015.

**Selector Infected WIXOSS(7-12):**

Finished up the anime. It was okay. It started to become interesting after like episode 9 or something ([Spoiler ep.9](/s "the one where Yuzuki becomes a LIRIG")).
>> ARTICLE
Completed **BTOOOM!**, because I like to suffer and wait for a season 2 that will never come. It is a really good show actually. 7.5/10

Completed **Natsume Yuujinchou**. It isn't my cup of tea, definitely, but I actually kind of enjoyed it. Mainly Nyanko-sensei, because he is easily the best character in the show and turned boring situations into comedy moments. Natsume is very, very bland which is a shame. The rest of the cast manages to be good, and the stories are kind of nice and everything. If I ever feel like watching something relaxing, this will be the series to go to. 7/10

Then, my computer died and could only watch old stuff. So I ended up rewatching **Accel World**, but no one cares about this show so I'll move on.

Yesterday I, finally, started **Cowboy Bebop**, but I still don't have an opinion about it.

Total amount of episodes, although no one cares: 55, including the seasonal ones. I was busy with other stuff so I didn't watch a lot of anime.

**Higashi no Eden (Eden of the East) (11/11 finished)** - Wait, was this really an anime? It sure didn't feel like one. The premise(which was not revealed right at the start) did remind me of Mirai Nikki, but in terms of storytelling, this was vastly different. In that sense, this was more like 24. Characters mean nothing(except during the short intermissions), next objective means everything. 

And that was my favourite thing about the show. There were no cutoff points, no reasons to quit. I could easily just keep watching episode after episode without getting bored. Hell, this is one of a very small number of shows that I think could be extended quite far in terms of additional episodes(and they already kind of did, with the 2 movies that I have yet to watch). I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone.

**Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (The Tatami Galaxy) (11/11 finished)** - Well... What is there to say about this almost infamous show? 

Interesting visual style(s) with sometimes-smooth-sometimes-not transitions that ultimately serve their purpose perfectly, storytelling that goes from episodic to thematic to self-referential to paradoxically simultaneous to somehow sensibly conclusive, characters who at first glance are naive, narcissistic, kind, eccentric and outright evil but who are actually evil, eccentric, kind, narcissistic and naive at first glance in that exact order but actually in no particular order. Soundtrack was ok but forgettable, I guess everything can't be perfect.

Still 10/10, though.

**Kuragehime (Princess Jellyfish) (6/11)** - This show is more standard than the aforementioned shows. It's fairly trashy in its comedy, not unlike most harem and non-harem romcoms you see every season. In terms of plot, it's kinda like Watamote, except the main character doesn't actually want to be popular. What sets this show apart, however, is the fact that it's based on a josei manga. This means that the character interactions are fairly different. The humour is much more self-deprecating on all fronts and it passes the [Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) on several occasions(almost all of the time, in fact).

All in all, this show is worth checking out, if only for a few episodes.

**Kill La Kill (1-9)**

Started out pretty shitty and was rather reluctant to keep watching after the first couple of episodes, but it is getting better even though a good part of episode 9 seemed like a waste of time. I cannot really guess what is going to happen more than 3 episodes but I am getting more and more interested in it.

Yikes, where did my weekend go...

**Usagi Drop (11/11):** This is probably now in my 10 top all time favorites. What a wonderful story about something so selfless. While the art wasn't revolutionary, it was skillfully done and the voice overs and music were very tasteful too (even the child voice actors were quite good). A non-stop train to feels town. Now to forget the manga ever existed. D:

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (12/12):** Ohhhh boy. So many things I could write about this show. I could go on and on about symbols and social commentary, but the reality is you just need to go watch this. It is outstanding.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren (12/12):** If you just couldn't help yourself, you'll be like me and watch "Ren" as well. Unfortunately, you'll find a lot of filler and a very frustrating series. Hopefully KyoAni won't let it end here and will make another season or movie or something. Whatever you scored season 1, expect about 2 points lower for Ren.

**Tonari no Seki-kun (21/21):** To quote DemolitionD, "this show *gets* me." I haven't watched any anime with the ability to make me legitimately burst out laughing in a long time. Sure I chuckle or smile at some of the antics, but nothing was as genuinely funny as this show. As guy, I can absolutely relate to Seki-kun at every turn. What a wonderful way to way to *kill time.* ;)

**Lucky Star (1/24):** I don't think this is for me. I might watch another episode or two just to make sure, but I don't find it funny. I know I'm supposed to find it funny. I understand the jokes, the punchlines, and the general type of humor, but the timing (or perhaps the subject matter?) doesn't work for me. I can see where others would like it though.

**Blue Spring Ride (1/12):** Yeah, this is going to be right up my alley. Unfortunately, I waiting a week between episodes and CR only has two episodes out. I'll probably stop for now and wait till they are all released and then mainline the whole thing like a champ.

**[Ga-Rei: Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4725/Ga-Rei:_Zero)**

Mostly because of a [certain gif](http://i.imgur.com/gjNMBrX.gif) that's been going around lately, or rather the reactions to it (looking at you /u/NoviceElectromancer). In a word, holyshit.

[1st ep spoilers](/s "First off, the first two episodes. Attack On Titan got nothing on this in terms of killing off potential main characters. The ending of the first episode alone had me addicted.")

[Later spoilers](/s "The next few episodes were a complete change of pace, which I was initially hesitant about, but definitely found myself enjoying. And then the expected feels trip kicked off with the gutpunch to the emotions that was episode 9 (Yomi in the hospital). Despite knowing it was coming literally from the first episode, I was still totally unprepared.")

[Last ep spoilers](/s "And as much as I wanted there to be an 'everyone wins' ending (well, everyone other than the people who were already dead I guess), I'm kind of glad that they made Kagura kill Yomi.")

Good stuff. Fantastic soundtrack too.

[spoiler] So this week I watched "Chibi Vampire/Karin" episodes 1-4 with my boyfriend. What started this was discussing Anime and I ask him if he's watched before, he tells me no but he's read the mangas and enjoyed those. So I'm excited because he may like the anime series. There's so much i enjoy about this series. I've watched it completely before but i'll explain what I like from what I saw so far this time. My favorite part so far is when Karin finds out she's attracted to unhappiness. She thinks that her blood taste is embarrassing, and Kenta has a strong dose of unhappiness, so she's trying to get him to be happy. Karin's friend Maki Tokitou (I may have the name wrong) noticed that Kenta was very hungry so she gave him Karin's spare lunch. Kenta gave Karin the bento at the end of the episode and was thankful. Karin says at the end that "happiness is a boxed lunch!" which is my all time favorite quote from that show.

**Texhnolyze (13/22)** (pronounced: Tek-no-lies)

I don't know what to make of this

...

...

[](/s "Holy fuck")

First off, check out [that OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3SzOzm8lmo) with a song by Juno Reactor. This might knock *Key the Metal Idol* off as the weirdest show I've ever seen. And the darkest, like this might be one of the darkest shows out there (Shin Sekai Yori's got nothing on this). There is such a heavy and bleak atmosphere pervasive throughout the whole thing, combined with washed out backgrounds and Yoshitoshi ABe's designs give this thing an incredibly unique and dark presentation. The cinematography is almost western-like, the dialog is very minimalist, lots of symbolism, and the storyline is quite cryptic. The characters don't say much at all, and we don't hear their thoughts. We learn about the characters by their actions, which is actually kind of refreshing instead of having it spelled out for you like usual.

It's a draining show to watch, since you really have to use your head to piece together who the characters are and what is happening. So, to my surprise, I ended up marathoning quite of a bit of it! It's just so enthralling and interesting to watch. Though the ED might have helped out a bit, [this ED is fantastic!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh1hoNwFfg8) and such a contrast to the rest of the show. While everything usually sounds so muffled and disturbing and electric, the ED is a wonderful change of pace with it's acoustic guitar and bright colors. Like this may end up being one of my all-time favorite EDs.

Anyways, I think I like this show. It's *so interesting*.

Would you believe it's the same director as Steins;Gate?!

**Gintama** (24/201) - Watched 11 episodes this week to keep up with the [group discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/29wdoq/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_1924/). It's still hit or miss a lot of the time but I'm enjoying it more overall. Whether that's because I've gotten used to it or because it's gotten better I'm not sure. Some individual points:

* Captain Katsura was fun. Not sure how I feel about Zura getting crazier though.
* Elizabeth is... eh. New ending is great though.
* Much like Shinpachi, I didn't want to spend an episode looking at/hearing about his sister's panties. Seems like most other people really liked it, but again it's not my preferred style. All of the landmine triggers were fun if predictable.
* The stories with the kappa Amanto and Gintoki hunting down a fan were both good.
* In general, I like any episode dealing with the dynamic between humans and Amanto. Terrorists and resistance plots are good.
* Sa-chan is my new favorite character in the show, but I hope she gets some character development beyond the pilot and her introduction. It's partially the glasses.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (6/64) - I dont remember specifics of the original FMA but I feel like Scar didnt become a major threat this early on. I like this pacing though, and Armstrong gets more time to sparkle on screen which I always love.

---

**Baccano!** (16/16) - I eventually came to the realization that this is basically what Quentin Tarantino would do for an anime series, plus [](/s "immortality, alchemy, and the Mafia.") Blew through the last half of the show in one day and I have to say it works much better that way than with one episode a week. Isaac and Miria are the best crazy couple, followed by Nice and Jacuzzi. Overall: a great dub and one of the best [opening themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOZ1hsb8smQ). Ill have to give it a second viewing at some point and see what I missed given the out-of-order style, but its already in my top 5 favorite series.

**Score: 9/10**

Edit: after watching the OP again for the first time since wrapping up a few days ago I realized I'm really going to miss these characters. I might have to bump up that rewatch sooner than expected.

**ef: A Tale of Memories** (12/12) - (I started writing this at 5/12 and kept adding as I went along so it will likely end up very disjointed.)

I love the shifts in art style they have at times. [ef](/s "Kei blames herself for Chihiros accident because she stole Hiro from her sister for one day? Thats rough.") Unfortunately, the music that starts playing after [ef](/s "Chihiro says Renji should kiss her then") reminded me so much of the [Exorcist theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1PH_Y8Xn4g) that I started laughing and it completely ruined the moment for me. [ef](/s "And then Miyako has a breakdown and its legitimately uncomfortable to listen to her leaving all those messages. After a back-and-forth with Hiro being a complete idiot for not deciding, nearly everything goes to pieces but he miraculously manages to salvage both relationships after talking to an angel or something. By the end I was more in favor of Kei than Miyako though.")

At least Renji and Chihiros side of things went decently. [ef](/s "And then they banged on the roof of the school and she decides to throw out her diary entries. He goes though a collect-the-pages quest but turns out he didnt need to because she cant stop thinking about him. Daww.") Overall, the much slower pacing was quite welcome compared to the other series Ive been watching, and while the Kei-Hiro-Miyako side ended up being fairly clich, Renji and Chihiros story was uniquely endearing.

**Score: 8/10**

> Not sure how I feel about Zura getting crazier though

He is only going to get crazier, but he's going to be one the funniest guys in the show IMO.

I watched the earlier episodes of Gintama again and it was really weird seeing how Zura was more serious and well...a little bit boring. I think they took awhile to just really find his character and I personally like him much better as he is now than before.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion 2/26**

Yes, this is my first time watching Evangelion. I've known about Eva from before I was ever into anime, yet for some reason I just held off on watching it. I finally decided that it was time to watch the anime that so many people love.

**Mobile Fighter G Gundam 2/49**

I'm a big fan of the Gundam franchise, but I really haven't watched any non-UC Gundam series. I decided to pick up G Gundam after seeing pictures of the various crazy mobile suits that are present in the series. I mean come one, [one of them is a windmill.](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120818152956/gundam/images/c/c3/GF13-066NO_Nether_Gundam_Front.png) *That's brilliant.*

I'm normally not one for adventure shounen type shows, but the setting of this one looked intriguing. It's definitely a day-time shounen series, but I'm enjoying it so far.

**Cardcaptor Sakura 10/70**

The buzz around Sailor Moon Crystal got me excited for magical girl shows again, and this is one of the classic magical girl anime that I had never watched. I'm really liking it so far, perhaps more so than Sailor Moon.

**Seto no Hanayome 2/26**

Apparently I downloaded this months ago and forgot about it? I don't know, I just found it on my hard drive. I don't quite remember why I even downloaded it. But hey, it actually seems better than the premise suggests. It's very funny, and a bit of a break from more serious anime.

**Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya 7/10**

G Gundam is a fantastic blend of various ridiculous ideas. The director is apparently a big film and TV buff, and he cheerfully borrowed images and elements from various international films and from old martial-arts TV serials.

I'm told the reception of the show among Gundam fans initially wasn't particularly positiveand I can imagine why!but personally I think, with a longer-term perspective, it actually manages to be a more coherent and successful piece of entertainment than some of the AU Gundam titles which cleave more closely to the UC formula.

#[Ripped from the /r/TrueAnime thread...](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/29uh51/your_week_in_anime_week_90/ciolvt2)

Finished up the last 6 episodes of ***Wandering Son*** (6-12/12). Note, by the way, that MAL will say it's an eleven episode series. During the block it aired, it was only allowed 11 episodes, so they spliced episodes 10 and 11 into one, and aired that. The BD/DVD came out with the complete versions of the show, and [*Wandering Son Specials*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10935/Hourou_Musuko_Specials) are those two episodes. 

[So I spent all my time gushing last time,](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/299lup/your_week_in_anime_week_89/ciirj8q) but you've probably heard enough of that (as did pretty much everyone on my Twitter; I apologize guys, I just couldn't help myself.) Very minimalistic dialogue and sound, still allowed the viewer to use their brain to infer motivations, etc. Still kind of bothered by how mature and "restrained" the cast is.

It's this last point that I want to address, because I think it's the primary point of contention I have with the show. On the one hand, being too muted and restrained means that suspension of disbelief is easily broken when you remember how young these kids are. On the other hand, though, the few times that Nitori gets something resembling emotional and [](/s "tells off Doi for being the little shithead he's always been (intentionally or not), the viewer feels that same heady rush of emotion that Nitori has when he realizes that he just stood up to someone.") By being so muted so often, the moments of real emotional catharsis or drama are amplified in power because they're so *rare*.

Speaking of catharsis, I'm happy about the climax, even if I secretly wish we got...more. It's fitting, for sure, and it's the capstone to a great amount of character development, especially on Nitori's part. Given that there were many more volumes of manga ahead of the finale, this was honestly the best way they could've ended it given the circumstances - [](/s "Nitori realizing that despite his best efforts, he's still growing into a boy, but then accepting it and showing his determination to change") was inevitable. I think my slightly tepid reaction to the ending is because I wanted something more...sweeping? Grand? It doesn't really fit the kind of show that *Wandering Son* is, but there was a distinct lack of finality to it. It felt like the ending to a first season, and given that there's a 0.001% chance we'll ever get a sequel, this should effectively be "it". It's just not enough.

I also wished we'd got more time to explore the side-characters. In particular, I'm interested in finding out more about Chi-chan. But I guess I always have the manga for that. 

At the moment, my provisional score is a 9, as I debate whether or not I found it memorable enough to be a 10. Either way, though, I *highly* encourage everyone to watch this if they like character focused shows and are tired of overly-emotional shows weighed down by an obsession with ***FEELINGS*** (you know what I'm talking about.)

Not sure where I'm going from here. I'm holding off on *Psycho-Pass* until I get confirmation of anyone subbing/streaming the re-air, and I dunno what else to tackle. Anyone want to give me an idea from my watch-list?

Dude.

Shinsekai Yori.

> Still kind of bothered by how mature and "restrained" the cast is.

For me, a trans* person that knows several trans* people, that was quite believable. Most of the trans people I know were like that when they were young and the drama was mostly in their head which is understandable if one remembers that "the wrong body" tends to not be the place to show "the correct" emotions. Sure, the rest of the cast is quite "restrained", but it fits the boy.

Imo one of the most important aspects of the anime, and in this case the anime is very true, is that a girl acting as male is regarded as good and a male acting female is recarded as dysfunctional.
>> ARTICLE
I see, I didn't really consider that. I think my primary basis for that was that...well, honestly, all the middle schoolers I knew were insufferable and melodramatic little shits. I don't know any trans* people in real life, either, so I couldn't even rely on their first-hand knowledge to inform my statements. 

You're right, though, that being restrained fits Nitori greatly, regardless of his identity, so he's kind of the one exception to my "complaint." 

>a girl acting as male is regarded as good and a male acting female is recarded as dysfunctional.

Yeah, the anime did discuss that at length. What was kind of heartbreaking is that there was no "solution" that would've changed people's perceptions, other than time and persistence at making people not judge you like that.

I personally couldn't really get into it.

It was just excruciatingly boring to me. I didn't find it particularly funny, I didn't find the characters too compelling (especially MC) and the attempts at being a dark series fell flat due to the jarring contrast with the moe factor of the shows (dance scene for example).

It however *looks* really nice, but I can't find anything that is particularly enjoyable outside of that.

I'm only just getting back into anime after a long hiatus so I've been watching a lot of short animes from the last few years. 

So far I've gone through in the last week:

 - **NGNL**: This was a lot of fun. I loved how the siblings were so confident indoors and not so much outdoors.

 - **Hataraku Maou-sama**: Mad giggles. Really liked the sheer ridiculousness of the situation. 

 - **Nisekoi**: Only a few eps in, but I read the manga so I know what I'm in for.

 - **Golden Time**: Watching an ep right now. Couldn't get into the manga but was quite interested in it so here we go.

 - **Sakurasou No Pet No Kanojo**: I've had the opening and ending songs on repeat.

 - **Yu-Shibu**: Almost forgot this one. I like Airi so I wasn't having the most fun times.

If there are any good anime from the last few years that I haven't named that you reckon I'd enjoy, let me know. On holidays now and I am in full swing.

**Sakura Trick (12/12)** - Went into this expecting moe yuri cuteness and that's exactly what I got

**Katanagatari (3/12)** - Really liking this one so far. All the characters are enjoyable and funny. I loved the catchphrase bit and how its continuing. I've only heard amazing things about this series, so I'm excited to continue it.

**Knights of Sidonia (6/12)** - This was sold to me as Attack on Titan in space with mechs (Yes I know this series came first) and it really fits. The similarities are huge really - Humanity living in a small isolated place, attacked by monsters of unknown origin. Its been one hundred years since the last major incident,  [both series spoilers](/s "the 'elite' team gets wiped out so the rookies can take center stage, and both government have an interest in the main character because he has something special about his skills"). Not saying its a bad thing, I enjoyed AoT for what it was, and I'm enjoying this as well. Also, from following the discussion threads along with watching introduced me to the program SVP (can't link, on mobile =\ ), which has pretty much changed how I watch everything, so that's fantastic

I just stopped OreImo after [he](/s "confessed to his sister"). I know that's kind of being a bad sport, but I just couldn't deal [with](/s "best girl losing so badly"). But from what people have told me, I'm not missing out on much.
>> ARTICLE
Right?  I kind of wish I didn't watch the online episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I had to finish the series just because it was so close to the end, but you're not wrong for stopping. It just kept getting more and more difficult to watch until the very end [Spoiler](/s "when they reveal they were only pretending to date each other, but that just pissed me off more because he then dumped Kuroneko for no reason.") 

[Spoiler](/s "I really feel like I missed something with the end because the final reveal was just too sudden. Could someone explain why they pretended to date each other because it seriously pissed me off.").
>> ARTICLE
The author just made it like that for some reason, even though all the fans preferred Kuroneko more... He did an AMA on 4Chan in which he answered a bunch of questions about the storyline. And I agree with you, it was pretty hard to watch that ending.

Non Non Biyori 12/12

I really liked it and i'm glad i watched it
>> ARTICLE
This show is so calming...
>> ARTICLE
Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei - watched the first series a long time ago so I thought I'd give the second one a shot in the down time between seasons. It was so completely random and I absolutely loved it! Maria is just as good as I remember and I loved the part of episode two with Perry in. I can't wait to start the OVAs and third season of this!
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf. 

So damn good.
>> ARTICLE
Finished up the last 5 or so episodes of **Day Break Illusion**, very meh. Although that's about all I was expecting. It had it's moments though.


Now, **Kyousougiga**, that's a whole 'nother story. Absoulutely LOVED this series, it's at least in the running for my Top 5. It reminded me very much of FLCL, but where I'm not quite as confused.

Also **Encouragement of Climb.** Moe mountain climbing, what else do I need to say?
>> ARTICLE
I loved Yama no Susume and am very happy that it is getting a second season starting soon.
>> ARTICLE
I actually just heard about it from when Crunchyroll posted an article about the second season and I saw [this.](http://i.imgur.com/j0WDcAE.png) I'm a sucker for real life-anime crossover promotions and figured it was so short I'd give it a go. Just a nice, fun little series but sometimes that what I need haha.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's a much nicer introduction to Yama no Susume than I had. Mine was from a barely-remembered comment in /r/animesuggest when we were talking about anime shorts. It sounded interesting, so I put it at the top of my queue. And, quite frankly, I'm glad I did.
>> ARTICLE
Glad you enjoyed Kyousougiga, it is one my favorites as well. One of the few shows that I will bother rewatching.

>> ARTICLE
It just did everything so well: the visuals, the soundtrack, the characters...
>> ARTICLE
Just watched and finished Madoka Magica in one day. WOW. Just WOW. I'm a big shounen fan--I like shows targeted for boys usually. So when I saw Madoka Magica I thought it was just going to be some "kawaii shoujo crap" that 15 year old girls would like. 

I couldn't have been more wrong! Madoka Magica is up there with my favorite anime, now. And I watched it only on a whim. :) 

Edit: Up next, the Future Diary! 
>> ARTICLE
future diary is a pretty weak follow-up to madoka magica, but it'll probably clear your palate.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no! I don't want anything weak lol! :( 
>> ARTICLE
it was entertaining enough, it's just that the survival game/battle royale premise is pretty weak to begin with, and things start to get pretty weird toward the end.
>> ARTICLE
Hm. :| Well, would you recommend it? 
>> ARTICLE
sure.  i don't regret watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Watching Mirai Nikki right now, I don't think it's as "weak" as he's says it is. It's an enjoyable ride with a great premise, and Yuno is fucking great haha
>> ARTICLE
Haha! Seems interesting but I get reviews on opposing sides all the time! Half of the people I ask love it, the other have really dislike it. I don't know who to listen to! I suppose I just have to check it out myself. I saw the pilot a loooooong long time ago when it premiered, and I didn't really get into it. But I never judge a series based solely on the pilot, so I've been meaning to dive back in. *sigh* We'll see what happens!

That's because Yuno is love.  Yuno is life.

[**Tari Tari**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13333/Tari_Tari) (5/13) - Decided to pick up a show someone told me was very good, and it gave off a SOL vibe and that's what I like watching.

The art is superb, and I was surprised to see a comprehensible plot developing with tidbits of character development alongside it. I enjoy all of the characters, and if the show continues going this way, I'll definitely end up dropping it a 9/10 on MAL.

Been re-watching [**OreShura**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14749/Ore_no_Kanojo_to_Osananajimi_ga_Shuraba_Sugiru) and am on episode 11, I had seriously forgotten how much Fuyumi's arrival makes that show better. It needs a second season badly. [OreShura](/s "Ai-chan daishouri")

Finished Neon Genesis Evangelion and End of Evangelion.

I can see why there's a lot of hype about Evangelion. The storyline is interesting/shocking. The characters are portrayed in a unique way. It's really, really bleak and kind of hopeful. Overall, it's a great anime, but around the last 5 episodes and the movie I just began to hate the entire thing. It was still very interesting around that point in the story, but it got a LOT harder to watch. I'll acknowledge that it's an exceptional series, but I'd describe the latter episodes of NGE and the movie as the animated equivalent of being repeatedly punched in the face. 
>> ARTICLE
Marathoned all of NGNL, pretty decent its very overrated in my opinion though. 7/10

Also started to rewatch Bleach haven't watched since 2006 probably going to stop after the Soul Society arc.
>> ARTICLE
This is a really a "wait a week for a new episode" anime. Just waiting a week to find that [NGNL spoiler](/s "Sora doesn't exist anymore") is almost devastating. 
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari  12/12**  
This is the best show I have seen in a long time. The characters dialogues and interactions were some of the best. Every episode, a new character is introduced and we are told their reason for fighting and their original backgrounds. Yasuri Shichika starts out as a character whose only goals were those that Togame set for him, which was to protect her, himself and the swords. In the beginning, Shichika refers to himself as a tool of Togame but as the series went on, Shichika interacts with the owners of each sword and he [](/s "slowly gains humanity and becomes a human with his own emotions, desires and goals.") Togames changes are how you interpret the ending, she claims to [](/s " learned about having fun, laughing and enjoying life but her overall nature was still that of scheming and trickery") and her overall goal was still[](/s "revenge"). I also loved every Maniwani character, they were all unique and had their own personalities. The art was great in my opinion, but I could see that I might not before everyone. The OPs were average but the EDs matched each episode and whether you like all of them is personal taste. I thought 1 and 12 were the best. If you are a shounen lover and just want to see some fight scenes with katanas then this show is not for you because it is based on its dialogue. Otherwise I think this is Nisio Isin best work and everyone should give it a chance.  

**Score 10/10**


**Aquarion Evol 26/26**  
Wasnt mecha fan and this show did nothing to change that. Overall the character development was very miniscule, the MC Amata never changed throughout the entire show, he was weak and did not get anything done unless Mikono was around to Power him and was overall just a very static character. If anything, I thought the side characters had more development than the main ones. The story was not explained very well, everything seemed to come at you near the end. The last 4 episodes had so many twists and revelations that I couldnt even understand what was going on. The music was great for this show despite the mediocre story, [every insert song], OP and ED were very good. The art is nice, each character and mecha were drawn very well. Overall, if you like some cheesy romance with fancy mechas, you should check this show out and consider reading about or watching the prequel Sousei no Aquarion because it might clear up some details of the show.  
**Score 6/10**  

**Plastic Nee-san 12/12**  

This show is a series of ONAs that were around 2-3 min long each. All the episodes were just straight comedy. There was no plot, the characters did not have any development but they had great chemistry. The show delivered its comedy in the form of physical gags. I went into this show expecting pure comedy and nothing else and that was what I got. If you have half an hour to spare, you should definitely check out this show.  
**Score 7/10**

**Darker than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha  18/25**  
The story for this show is told episodically with mini 2 episode arcs. So far, I have enjoyed each arc and the characters that were in those arcs. The plot is easily understood as most details about the contractors and characters are explained and their backgrounds are usually shown to us, with the exception of the main character Hei. At this point of the show, I still dont know much about Hei and what his motives are but I hope that gets revealed sometime during the show.

>> ARTICLE
In case you didn't know, Darker than Black has two sequels. Be prepared to be disappointed by the (chronologically) second sequel.  
>> ARTICLE
**Bakemonogatari [15/15]** I know a lot of people really like this show, but it isn't for me. I enjoyed a few arcs, but this show gets a pretty meh enjoyment rating from me. 

Technically, however, I think it's good. There were very few instances where I spotted lazy animation and the colors are nice. 7/10

**Non Non Biyori [9/12]** I dropped this show back when it was airing and after watching 3/4 of the series, I honestly don't know what I was thinking. This is a very fun series that actually makes me laugh. 

The episodes feel quick and the characters are really nice. Renge is particularly good and even the side characters feel alive. Excited to finish this show

**Mars of Destruction [1/1]** I watched this a after seeing it on someone's MAL list as a 1/10. After watching it, why the fuck would they make a show this bad? It's not unwatchable, but it's a 2/10 at best. Who approved this garbage? 
>> ARTICLE
Ep 10 of NNB is probably my favorite. I hope you enjoy it!
>> ARTICLE
I also felt sorta "Meh" about Bake, as well as Nise. I rated both 7/10. But I absolutely loved Second Season, easy 9/10 for me!

**Nichijou** (9/26)


This is definitely becoming one of my favorite shows ever. I can only think of a few shows that reach the level of entertainment Nichijou has. I swear it just gets better with each episode. And Mio? I fuckin love Mio. 
>> ARTICLE
**Black Lagoon** (29/29) - Saw this on Toonami while on vacation, then saw someone post something about how great Revy's dialogue is, so I checked this out. Damn that was a fun show, though didn't expect it to get as dark as it did, especially with the kids. Also, the dub is amazing. Wholly recommend this series for anyone who wants a dark, yet fun action series. Hope more of this comes out. 
>> ARTICLE
I also watched Black Lagoon this week (essentially marathoned it) and it was amazing. Revy is such a fucking badass and Roanapur is such a shithole... it's brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
Watched **Clannad** and **Clannad: After Story**. Yes, I cried. I cried a lot. I really liked how After Story really goes beyond where every anime stops. It was quite a dramatic break when high school was over and they had to live in the real world. Also, can we all agree that Ushio is the sweetest, most well behaved kid in all of anime?

Also watched **Ano Natsu de Matteru**, which was fun, and finished the first season of **Natsume Yuujinchou**, which is beautiful and relaxing.
>> ARTICLE
Working!!
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari:**

This show captured my heart very fast. The lovable play between the two main characters just made me want their relationship to continue building and the action scenes were fantastic. This one climbed up to my top 5 spot instantly.

**Monogatari Second Season:**

It's Monogatari, It's great. Didn't expect this one to have some sad moments but I'm glad it did. Also Kaiki is best character.

**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 3/24:**

This show is really lovable so far. I love Dio and his audacious ways of fighting. I'm excited to see new characters appear and see what they bring to the table.
>> ARTICLE
Good to see that you're loving JoJo this early on. You'll greatly enjoy what the series has to offer later on, and eventually Stardust Crusaders.

Skip Beat!

Was watching some old AMVs and remembered how much I enjoyed that series. It's unfortunate that the manga ended up turning into a stereotypical shoujo, though.


[The AMV in question, if you're wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0vtjkYW2l0)
>> ARTICLE
Watched all three Evangellion rebuild films in a single night. Also started Hunter x Hunter, but I think that would classify as an airing show, even though I'm only on episode 7 out of the already 136 that are already out 
>> ARTICLE
**B gata H kei** - Very humorous romcom anime with ecchi elements that I enjoyed throughout the whole season in almost one go. And then I continued where the series left off in the manga. Great ending for the manga, hoped that S2 is there but I guess that won't come true. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
So I just started getting into anime, so I am going through highly recommended shows.

1. **Angel Beats!** (13/13) - Just want to say right now that this is my favorite series of all time now, even with its flaws.  I felt that every main characters (aka all the ones at graduation) plus Yui and Iwasawa had really fleshed out stories that I personally enjoyed.  The humor was also great in it and the OST was utterly perfect.  Many tears were shed.  I realllyyyyy hope at some time it gets the FMA -> FMA:B reboot to 26 episodes or so to flesh out the other characters, but even so I have been giving them personal backrounds in my head and that helps me have closure.  **10/10** for me.

1. **Toradora!** (25/25) - Loved it!  Was way more realistic than the other romantic eske shows I have watched.  The OST is fantastic as well.  I have not seen a more powerful scene than when [Toradora Spoilers](/s "Taiga realized she cared for Ryuji in the Christmas episode and started yelling his name").  I gave it a **9/10** in the end and it's #5 on my all time favorite list.

2. **Steins;Gate** (24/24), OVA (1/1) - Had to see what the fuss was about and I really did enjoy it.  The first 9 episodes or so were a bit boring but I heard to push through and I never drop anime so it wasn't a big deal.  Not only was the story fantastic but I felt that the logic behind how time travel worked was very fleshed out and made sense.  Also...that last line in the OVA made me squeal.  **9/10** as well.

3. **Bakemonogatari** (10/15) - I don't really know what to think about this one.  I have heard it's good and I enjoy the dialogue but I feel there are way to many things that just don't feel right to me.  Was it ever explained why there are these minor gods and stuff around?  Or is it just implied this world has them?  Are the seasons after much different than Bake?  I'd give it a solid **7.5/10** right now, for I do enjoy the dialogue, just not a personal favorite really.

4. **Fate/Zero** (6/25) - I'm slowly trudging through Fate/Zero...Episode 5 was good but I am not really pulled in yet.  I'll have to keep giving it a chance.

5. **Clannad** (5/23) - I really like it so far.  Interested to see where it goes and why Clannad: AS is so tear jerking.  The scenes with the girl all alone are partially confusing but I feel like it will resolve itself in the future.  Also...does this guy know any guys other than Sunohara?  Like what.

>> ARTICLE
Wow, you are watching/watched 4 of my most liked animes!  
Clannads first season was ~okay~ for me but it really shined in After Story.  
Fate/zero gets really good especially in the 2nd season so keep watching!  
How did you like Bake's episode 12?  
Steins;Gate has like the slowest start I know but it has a payoff that makes it worth imho :P
>> ARTICLE
Remind me what happened in episode 12.  Is that the first snake episode?
>> ARTICLE
[Bake ep12](/s "The date of Senjougahara and Ararararagi.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh damn, I totally botched the episodes watched number.  I swear I was further along.  I finished episode 10.
>> ARTICLE
OH. Good thing I didn't spoiler too much... But yea, ep 12 is great D:
>> ARTICLE
Toradora has an AMAZING OST for a show that is not action based in any way. Both OP's and ED's, AND the Christmas song, were all fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
you watched the post-credits scene in the last episode of angel beats!, right?
>> ARTICLE
Of course.  The one where [Angel Beats! spoilers](/s "Otonashi and Kanade meet in real life, right?")

yes that one.  lots of people miss it!

that was beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
It hurts a lot to see Angel Beats be "better" than Steins;Gate... well, everyone likes what they like.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't dislike Steins;Gate though.  It's just that first half is really drawn out, once it hits it's stride it's a 10/10 but you can't just ignore the pedestrian first 8ish episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Stick with the Clannad, and keep us updated!
>> ARTICLE
- Fate/Zero: 6/25 - Really nice animation, but the plot is a little confusing. I'm looking forward to the fights!


- Bleach 14/366 - I'm enjoying this so far. I'm probably going to stop at episode 63 where the soul society arc ends, and then read the manga, because I heard that there is so much crappy filler. 

- Black Butler II - 1/12 - The new main character sucks so far, he is such an ass! I'm wondering if it will be as good as Black butler I.
>> ARTICLE
For Bleach, just skip the filler arcs. Honestly, they are pretty crappy and not worth watching. 
>> ARTICLE
I wish I could watch Fate/zero again for the first time. It's getting so good especially in the 2nd season.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah in Bleach episode 64-109 wasn't really my favorite arc, reading the manga though. I'd recommend once you get to episode 110 to start watching the anime again because in my opinion the  fight scenes and scenery art look way better than in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Been watching Gintama, One Piece, Bakemonogatari, Soul Eater and Knights of Sidonia.

Knights of Sidonia is my favourite!
>> ARTICLE
I've finished rewatching **Code GeassPP. I can finally understand its problems, but it still is an amazing show.

I've started **Nagi no Asukara**, currently on episode 17. It is the best drama I've ever seen (it is much better than Clannad season 1 or AnoHana). It actually has a story, the characters are really good and it isn't cheesy or boring to watch. I hope it continues to develop this well. My only problem with it is the lack of explanations on how they can actually live underwater. It has a severe lack of "suspension of disbelief", or whatever it is called.
>> ARTICLE
Been on a slice of life kick lately, watching some shows that I haven't gotten around to yet: Clannad, Toradora, Golden Time, and Nisekoi.

Also trying to get my brother further into anime, watching Code: Breaker and Darker Than Black with him.

Finaaallly started with [Fullmetal Alchemist](http://myanimelist.net/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist) (20/51), I was waiting for the summer vacation to hit before starting it and have been loving every moment of it so far
>> ARTICLE
FMA handles some of the early stuff better, like a certain character's sad little explosion, than Brotherhood does because it's more stretched out and Brotherhood rushed a little, a little, through the early stuff because, hey, it'd already been done. Brotherhood is the superior anime overall. Both feel much like the same show. 
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood is generally better IMO, but watching the original series gives you a much better idea of the quality change. Also, not sure if the same applies to the Japanese dub, but they change one or two English actors between the two series, namely Al. You get used to it quick, but it can be jarring. Fair warning.
>> ARTICLE
**Gintama** (63/276?): Began watching it for the weekly threads, but got really hooked. Just finished the Benizakura arc and it was awesome.
>> ARTICLE
The first movie is also the Benizakura arc if you didn't give that a try, and enjoy the rest of the series :)
>> ARTICLE
I'm slightly more than half-way through [**Revolutionary Girl Utena**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/440/Revolutionary_Girl_Utena).

* I really like the art and its stylistics

* soundtrack is also good

* the story still has many unrevealed elements and I try to avoid spoilers, anyway what I saw so far is intriguing and mostly coherent

* the shadow theatre girls are fun; I wonder if they have any plot significance apart from satirically commenting upon the events of the show

* the main minus is repetitiveness: lots of reused footage, most of each arc's episodes follow Monster of the Week convention etc.

* and finally, the only sane character is Chu-Chu




>> ARTICLE
I finished the **Nodame Cantabile** series this week. I absolutely loved the first season, but the second and third season just weren't on par with the first. The ending was really disappointing [since](/s "Nodame never played in a concerto with Chiaki") But one thing I did get out of the series was the fantastic music.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the later seasons couldn't hold up though I still loved it. I have to wonder if that was because they had half as many episodes and just needed to cut a lot.
>> ARTICLE
I watched all of Eden of the East this week! Crazy stuff, I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
I've recently gotten back into anime after taking a year off for personal reasons, so I've basically been binge watching shows from the entire previous year, most of which are in the Summer and Autumn Season.

Out of all of them, the one that made the most impact on me is **Log Horizon**. It's everything I wanted SAO to be when I first heard of it, though I wished it had the same animation quality of SAO. The world made me interested enough to read the light novels, which is saying something since I usually avoid translated text works. Can't wait for the second season this autumn.

**Fate Kaleid Illya** is great on it's own merits, though for a fate perspective it's not as good as Zero and from a magical girl perspective it's no Madoka or Nanoha. Also, [Prism Illya Ep6](/s "they never explained what's going on with the lock in Ep 6, nor do they explain how exactly Emiya becomes a Heroic spirit considering the vast setting changes between F/SN and F/KLPI.") I've heard that this gets explained in the second season, but considering how it took up almost 3 episodes, the way they just dropped it after episode 8 kinda annoys me.

I've watched 3 episodes of **Kill La Kill**, and maybe I've been ruined by the hype train, but it didn't grab me by the balls the way everyone on this subreddit said it would. From what I've seen, it's a typical shonen anime with gratuitous fanservice and a really weird art style. Hope it gets better later, but with 2 entire seasons worth of shows to choose from, it's probably going to take awhile before I go back to it.

**Evangelion 3.33**. [Evangelion 3.33](/s "Poor communication kills, In medias res for too long, Pathetic Shinji.") Worst of the new ones.

**No Game No Life** My other great love of this binge watching session. Apart from the psychedelic color palette, I've liked everything about this show. It reminds me of Code Geass's before they went all in with the super robot train wreck bullshit, and it manages to mix comedic and serious elements together without having either of them overshadow the other, like what happens to most other series. Made me really interested in Sakurasou, which I'm planning to watch after I'm done with my current series.

Right now I'm currently watching **Henneko**, up to episode 4. It seems to be progressing abit too fast, since by episode 4 the basic premise of the show has basically been resolved and what's left is the budding love triangle. Basically, I don't know where this series is going to go next, and that worries me because the last time I watched an anime that resolved all it's plot points by mid season it turned into utter shit with the next episode, so I'm hoping that Henneko doesn't follow it's footsteps.

**Bakemonogatari (15/15)**

**Nisemonogatari (11/11)**

**Nekomonogatari: Kuro (4/4)**

**Monogatari Series: Second Season (2/26)**

I just finished up the last Bakemonogatari at the beginning of the week and I absolutely loved it, its easily in my top 5 series.  So I pressed on with the rest of the series and its honestly been great so far.  What's there not to like about the series?  The dialog is hilarious and amazing, the visuals are top notch, the music is top notch, the characters are also really unique and interesting.  

I was a bit wary of Nise since my friend who recommended the show said it was way more Ecchi than the first season but I loved it almost as much as Bake.  The infamous toothbrush scene was honestly one of the weirdest, funniest, and most awkward scenes I've ever seen and it might be my favorite seen in Monogatari so far.  Also Shinobu finally shows up and quickly became my favorite character.

So far so good, I'm hoping to finish up Second Season before Hanamonogatari in August but I've picked up quite a few shows (I think like 9 in total) so it might be a bit tough.

Welcome to the club homie.

Watched all of Jormungand this week. Lots of great gunporn, interesting characters, good storytelling. I particularly like the grey morality, it's refreshing to watch something where all the main characters aren't pacifist idealists that'll save everyone with willpower and guts. My only real complaint is that even some of the main characters don't really get explored all that much. While that's obviously intentional for some (the Hekmatyar siblings, for example) some of the others definitely deserved a bit more screen time. 

Also rewatched most of Kokoro Connect, barring one or two of the slower episodes. Not going to go into details for a rewatch. 

I suppose I'm also rewatching Durarara... well right now basically, while waiting for panels at RTX I want to watch. Can't get enough Miyuki Sawashiro this week. Or ever.

**Katanagatari 8/12**

I absolutely love this series. The eyes are probably one of the things I like about this show most. There are so many unique types and they look absolutely hilarious. I am a bit sad that the ending was spoiled for me, but I am not really affected by it that much. Interactions between Togame and Shichika are funny. Only things I dislike about this show so far are the overall strength of the Maniwani being so low, and how short the battles tend to be. His catchphrase felt like a bit of a joke early but he seems to fit it in almost perfectly in every fight. I thought it would have been hilarious if he went with Chesto or Cheerio though. So far a 8/10, nothing really standing out from this show so far as opposed to others. It seems like a lighthearted action series which cannot sever its bonds from romance and comedy. This show does not blow me away but it definitely keeps me in my seat watching it. 

**Kimi no Todoke Complete**

GIVE ME A KISS GODDAMIT. Not really my style of anime, was tied with bad miscomprehension drama and art was extremely mediocre at times. Overall, it accomplished its goal and established strong relationship development. The pacing was great *when* it actually stuck to the main conflict. I wish Sadako would really shut up about how Kazehaya changed her life though. I heard it twice and I was like wow this dude is an awesome guy. 7 times over, please stop being such a fangirl. This series was overall enjoyable to me, but I feel like just about anything I watch could have replaced or overtaken it.

**Gintama [9/201]**

Fell behind the weekly discussions going on and trying to catch back up. Find it humourous but still daunted by the length. Probably just need to quickly get up to the weekly discussion so that I can get more into rhythm of watching them.

**Nichijou [3/26]**

Another comedy that I just watch every now and then. Good fun to watch and I don't mind the humour which slightly concerned me before I started. 

**Selector Infected WIXOSS [2/12]**

I considered picking this up when it was airing, but decided against it since I was watching a lot that season. Pretty much on a whim just decided to pick it up today and am probably going to watch a few more episodes today. I'm getting a very similar feeling that I had with Madoka in that it feels like there's something darker going on. I've heard mixed things about the show, and am unsure what I think of it so far, it could go either way for me, I think.

**Time of Eve [6/6]**

I loved this show. Marathoned it one night and just enjoyed watching and learning about the characters. One of the few shows that made me actually cry. It's only short and I'd urge anyone to at least give it a go. 

**Fate/Zero [25/25]**

I had started off watching Fate/Stay Night ages ago but dropped it since I just didn't find it interesting. It was a great show as I expected going in given all the praise I've seen for it. I was confused a bit by the ending, but as I plan to watch the new Fate/Stay Night thing coming out at some point, I expect most of the confusion I had can be cleared up, and I'm not planning on looking anything up as I want to avoid spoilers. 

**Pale Cocoon [1/1]**

It was interesting, albeit I don't remember too much stuff right now. It didn't stand out massively to me, but I didn't dislike it, but nor did I get invested much into it. 

**Ocean Waves**

Randomly decided to watch this, and thought it was okay. Nothing much to it, though I did find the characters somewhat interesting. There were parts that I didn't like all that much, but overall I thought it was fine. May consider rewatching it at some point which may change my opinion.

**5cm per second [3/3]**

I feel like I will appreciate this show more if I rewatch it, whenever that happens. I think my mindset wasn't quite right when I started watching it, but I think knowing what's happening might give me a better impression of it. Still thought it was good, but not as good as I was expecting. 
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari (12/12)** - Not as good as the internet had led me to believe. I didn't really respond to the writing in the couple episodes of Bakemonogatari that I saw, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I wasn't as in love with this show as a lot of people are. Togame just never worked for me as a character, and I never thought she got to be more than just a tsundere. I grew really sick of the comedy that was shoehorned into the show through her. The show liked to move between grave seriousness and goofy comedy without a lot of nuance or care about tonal consistency. And really that's how I feel about the show over all, it's just really inconsistent. Sometimes the animation during the fights was great, sometimes it was a glorified slideshow. Some of the episodic characters were fascinating, some of them weren't. I didn't care for Shichika for half of the show, and then I did. Sometimes the direction and scene composition in the really dialog heavy bits was interesting, and sometimes it wasn't. Even the music was used really inconsistently, there was one track that I felt like they kept using at inopportune moments, but sometimes it was used well. I will say, I liked the final episode's climax, and the very clever character design.

**Aim for the Top! Gunbuster (6/6)** Hideaki Anno's directorial debut with Studio Gainax. I watched Aim for the Ace! a while back, and the first episode really is a loving tribute to that show. The parallels are very obvious. Still, it's kind of neat to see Anno having fun and making something because he thought it would be cool. The show does get a lot more serious later on, and due to the short length sometimes the transition feels a little abrupt, but it mostly works. One of the show's most interesting and compelling ideas was about [Spoilers for second half](/s "the timeline differences between space and Earth, and how 6 months in space could be 15 years on Earth. This means that teenage pilots would return home to find their friends have aged and left them behind or even died.") This added to some of the increased melancholy in the second half, but I thought it was effective. It's a fast watch, and has aged pretty well despite the fashion being very 80's, I'd recommend it.

The entirety of The Tatami Galaxy, wow what a show. While the start was a bit slow, the message it delivered and the way the last two episodes brought everything together were truly amazing.

Watching my way through the second part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) which covers the Battles Tendencies portion of the manga. 

I have had a weird JoJo experience. I watched the first part after catching up on the currently airing Stardust crusaders but have to say that at the moment that i enjoy Joseph as a protagonist more so than than Johnathan or Jotaro. I think it comes down to his personality, which is drastically different from the other two's more serious and brutish nature. 

Also Joseph has a spiffy scarf.
>> ARTICLE
blasted through mekakucity actors over two nights now that it's finished up.  i enjoyed the snippets of the story about the monster at the ends of the episodes, and overall the series was a lot of fun.  i liked how they did the eye powers.  three of the characters' eye powers were all based around perception - the one caused others to not perceive her, the one caused others to perceive her, and the other one caused othersto perceive him however he wanted.  that was cool.  
however, it did show its weakness as a short adaptation of a monolithic media franchise.  without listening to the songs, watching the videos, reading the manga, there's just too much left out.

i also started watching the idolm@ster.  (5/25).  it is silly and cute and i don't expect too much from it but it is a lot of fun.

**Flowers of Evil** (13/13) 

Really twisted psychological show. I found myself strangely attracted to Nakamura, which I guess says a lot about me. The rotoscoping wasn't popular with a lot of people, I know, but I think it allowed the faces to be a lot more expressive, especially Nakamura's smiles. I need to read the manga since it ended with a *insert manga here* episode. I think the atmosphere created by the audio was one of the biggest strengths, as Kasuga walked through the town.

**Last Exile** (26/26) 

Something about this show made me reminisce about Eureka 7, so I was waiting for it to get super strange quickly, or for the vanships to suddenly have souls or some such. I honestly have no complaints about Last Exile though. It was fun, made me itch to go play a WWI/WWII flight game. Should I try Fam, the Silver Wing?

**Mayo Chiki!** (13/13)   
I don't know why I was expecting so much from this. It started nicely, but then it went on to the "we're not going anywhere" -route. It was dissapointing, but enjoyable.

**Steins;Gate** (24/24 + OVA + Movie)  
10/10, must watch, recommending it everywhere. Reading the VN right now as we speak. Changed my phone mail alert to Tutturuu~~! Kurisu top 2 tsundere. Got my motivation back to study physics.

The Mayo Chiki manga finished earlier this year. Not sure exactly where the anime stops but a good amount of stuff happens and the resolution is pretty good. Overall a pretty decent read.

**Natsume Yuujinchou Season 2 (13/13 finished) & Season 3 (13/13 finished) & Season 4 (9/13)** - Yeah, I pretty much fell in love with this series back while watching S1 and have been watching nothing else since. I think this show defines the  recent "fantasy slice of life" subgenre, which has become so popular with shows like Gingitsune and Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha. In fact, Gingitsune is very similar to Natsume Yuujinchou. In both shows, the main character is one of only a few people who can see the fantasy creatures and in both shows, the main character has a lovable sidekick. Even the personalities of the sidekicks are fairly similar. In any case, I like this subgenre because of its possibilities. For Natsume Yuujinchou, that means that the episodes can be vastly different in terms of story. Some episodes are unbearably cute, others are nail-bitingly thrilling, with all of this being possible because there are very few rules you need to follow when creating supernatural creatures that are invisible to normal humans.

I don't really know what more to say about this show, since I covered a lot of it in my previous post, and the show doesn't change that much from Season 1 to Season 4. If I had to mention anything, it's that the later seasons focus more on people(more specifically, Natsume's relationships with other people) and less on the monsters.

All in all, I still recommend this to all fans of the slice of life genre. It also has some of the best Ending songs/animations I've seen in a long time: [Season 1 ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55hO1nR0b-I) & [Season 2 ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrSx8B-pwBc).

**Witch Hunter Robin 26/26**

After hearing Bana's "Shell" on an old burned CD my nostalgia over took me and I decided to watch it from start to end. I originally watched it on Adult Swim and missed the last 2 episodes due to sporting obligations and never knew how it ended. 

It was a pretty rough experience. The VA cast was filled with talented people but everything felt flat. I had high hopes after episode 14, when the STNJ is attacked that some sort of character development would grow from that episode but nothing really seems to come of it. I was really hoping for a big twist or revelation that wrapped it all up and just felt like I was left out of the story.

I'm not a big fan of detective shows like Criminal Minds or CSI and this show captured the atmosphere of that genre. I really liked the premise of the show and it had a ton of neat ideas, but character development really hurt watching this show for me. Add in the awkward dialogue of the dub and you have a flat **4/10.** 

The OP and ED are fantastic though!

Watched a movie and continued my watch from last week

**Psycho-Pass** (ep3-12)  
Really good so far. I enjoy the tension and the dystopian-ish world they live in. Episode 10 and 11 were really good and I hope to see some more of this. But why did they have to change out the Opening and Ending? I liked the first ones over the new ones. (Rating: around 9ish so far)

Rewatched **Mononoke Hime**  
I consider this Miyazakis greatest work of what I have seen from him. I watched this like 12 years ago when I was just half the age I'm now and god did I miss a lot back then. It's probably my favourite movies of all I have watched so far and it's really really hard to beat. (Rating: 10/10)

Watched 7 eps of Katanagatari. The first 2 eps bored me since I thought there was way too much talking for an action anime (saw it on the recommended list). Ep 4 was just mean, teased an epic fight and then the whole thing happened offscreen with the characters just talking about it after. I might finish the series by tomorrow but I'm kinda disappointed.

**Henneko (12/12)** (Watched 5-12 this week)

I enjoyed this. It seemed very light-hearted at first, but it slowly got darker, with some light-heartedness mixed in, or something. The idea for this anime was pretty unique, with the stony cat taking sacrifices and stuff. Hard to explain my feelings for this one. **8/10**

**Monster (48/74)** (Watched 41-48 this week)

Oh god this is intense. I can't get enough of this. I just have to find something to fill this void after I'm done with it. Ugh. So good. 

**Nanana's Buried Treasure (5/11)** (Watched 1-5 this week)

Not sure if this is appropriate here since it just ended recently, but I figured I'd put it in just to get some conversation about it if anyone's interested. I saw episode 1 when it started and figured I had more interesting stuff to watch, but the review threads interested me a bit so I bit the bullet and tried it again. Pretty good so far. I'm hoping there's some actual mystery solving processes happening in an episode. I love me a good mystery anime.

**Wolf Children (Movie)**

This was an interesting movie. At first, I felt like I was watching some furries' wet dream, but it quickly got better after the beginning part. It really was just a slice of life movie with really interesting character developments and stuff. I don't really know what else to say about it without getting into spoiler territory but it was very good. My one big downside is that it dragged a bit in my opinion. Maybe it's because I'm not used to movies yet. 2 hours is a long time! **8.5/10** 

**Porco Rosso (Movie)**

My first Ghibli movie since I started actually watching anime. It was good at first, but then it got progressively better and better until the end and by the end it was awesome. I loved the part where [Spoiler](/s "Porco and the villain (sorry, bad with names) get into a fight where they're throwing things at each other in the airplanes"). Very funny and all-around fun. **9/10**

**Eureka 7** (50/50)

I watched the whole thing in three days and really enjoyed it! The only thing that bugged me about the show were the kids. Holy crap... they are the most annoying characters of any show I think I have ever seen. I think the show could have gotten away with being about ten to fifteen episodes shorter, but every episode had a plot point that was important to the story besides the soccer showdown. Overall I would give the show a 9/10

**Toradora** (15/25) 

Really good. Humor's there. Even Taiga/Ami aren't too annoying because they show improvement, and we get to see different facets of everyone's personalities. Also really like the way they did Ryuji's "delinquent look" compared to simple references to Kodaka's hair/appearance/eyes in Haganai. I watch too many rom-coms, this was somehow funnier by being more realistic.

Taiga reminds me of someone used I know... there's a little resemblance. Rare expressions of happiness amidst a general moodiness. 

Continuing to work through the episodes, watched eps 1-15 yesterday, no regrets.

Hated the art style at first but I slowly came to like it, couldn't help but compare it to deathnote though. It was pretty sad and pretty enjoyable. wasnt 100% satisfied with the ending but I think it was probably the best way it could have ended.

I watched the first 6 episodes of love lab.

I swear, at least more than half of the people in the bus was looking at me while I tried to suppress my laughter. Lesson learnt: do not watch Love Lab in public. Woe-senpai slapping the President with a hand made slapstick is just hilarious. I personally love the style of the show and the art.

[RideBack](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4618/RideBack).  I just watched it on a whim since I've got this FUNimation subscription that I was using pretty much for Ping Pong, and I finished it in two sittings.  Surprised at just how decent of a show it was; it's merely good but not great due to focusing on just one character for the most part, but it hits its emotional beats quite well and is gorgeous to look at (despite conspicuous CG).  Really loved that dub, as well.

**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha The Movie 1st**: Rewatched yet again. A pretty good alternate retelling of the first season, with some things chnged around. Cut out the irrelevant scenes, and improved on the places where the show shines. All in all, definitely worth watching, but helps to watch the first season first, underwhelming as it maybe in the beginning. And with Doctor Who Season 8 coming up soon (August 23, less than 7 weeks), and the BluRays on October, I would probably keep to rewatching A's, the second movie and StrikerS.  
Also, [](/s ""I don't realize things until they are too late." Quite the sneaky sucker punch to the gut at the end.

[Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon) (Kids on the Slope) 12/12 eps

Two of my favorite genres are Music and Romance and this just happened to have both. I am a drummer so the second PV on Crunchyroll really got my attention. So I started casually watching it yesterday and before I knew it 5 hours had passed and I had just finished one of my new favorites. **Overall 10/10 Amazing, Must watch.**


[Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11843/Danshi_Koukousei_no_Nichijou) (Nichibros) 12/12 eps

One of the more funnier shows I have seen. Usually comedy anime doesn't completely click with me, but this one was definitely an exception. **Overall 8/10 Funny as hell**


[Ghost Hunt](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1571/Ghost_Hunt) 8/25 eps at the time of writing

I'm having a hard time with this show. The characters just don's sit well with me. I saw it on Netflix and was like meh why not. Watched the first arc and was kinda disappointed. The second arc was OK with one actual scary part that made me feel uneasy which got my hopes back up, but the third arc is back to being kinda slow. I might end up dropping it if it doesn't get its butt into gear. **So far 5/10 Boring for the most part, but it has its moments**

The Monogatari Series. Finished bakemonogatari, nisemonogatari, and nekomonogatari. 
In like the 8th episode of Monogatari.

I never was one for supernatural shows, and I had a slight thing for harem animes (it is, more supernatural, but it is), but the one thing that grabbed my attention the most was the visual representations of... Everything. From the flying words, to the constant angle switches, to the color scheme changes, and to the classic Shaft head lean. 
The anime literally bombards the eye and the mind with so many things at once, paired with he half episode long monologues that can't get your mind to take a break on processing and pondering the thought of everything the characters say.

I would go into every detail from what makes this anime good, from the setting, to the origin of the apparitions, to the unique heroines, (gotta admit that they redefine what a tsundere can be, and that's just the main heroine.) to the random iconic fan services (dat toothbrush),  and to the MC impact to heroines of the series. 

I recommend this anime to people who already have watched anime. Doesn't needed to be many but if they watched stuff like Death Note, AoT, and (insert random Harem anime here) then this anime will definitely captivate their eyes.

**Knights of Sidonia** (5/12) I'm pretty much a sucker for anything Sci-Fi and when Netflix finally released it I was hype. Needless to say so far, I'm pretty into it. The 3D is weird at first but once you get over it, oh man. It's great.

Have you seen Star Driver or Captain Earth? If you like overblown transformation/launch/attack sequences then watch them. Captain Earth has one of my favorite launch sequences.

Gargantia on The Verderous Planet is cool for different reasons. While there's not many fights and it could have been 4 episodes shorter, it a very fresh and satisfying take on a mecha series.

I can't think of anything else you didnt mention that's not a Gundam series roght now.

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggann**

Holy shit. After 3 months after starting this glorious achievement I finally got around to the last 2 episodes last night. They saved the whole budget just for that last fight. 

You know it's a good show where you've had the biggest twist spoiled for you and it still pulls at your heartstrings. It's also one of the most motivating shows I've watched. Everything that came out of Kamina's mouth should be on a poster.

Simon is a great MC. Amazing supporting cast. Everyone has a unique and fun personality, and I just love to watch these guys go into battle with this "Humanity, fuck yeah!" attitude (except for Rossiu, I hated him since the start).

While there are a few plot point that I disagree with (especially, that last minute death), it has a great OST, great characters, and great fights. What more could you want in a mecha?
>> ARTICLE
Sweet, I'm not the only one who was watching TTGL this week. Nice.
>> ARTICLE
Still kinda sad how he's nobody, he gained and lost so much.
>> ARTICLE
It's really easy to dislike Rossiu from the start. I hated him too, until I re-watched the first episode after the time skip (episode 13?), and somehow his prickness had been vastly reduced. It's a matter of perspective.

Oh, and did you watch the post-credits scene? :P
>> ARTICLE
I had no idea about the post credits scene. I feel like I need to rewatch the whole show now.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Everyone looked really weird and I really hate these "20 years later" epilogue a (don't get me started on Harry Potter). Still, it was nice to see how it all came full circle.
>> ARTICLE
Started watching [Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966) and I couldn't have guessed how much I'd like it. I've thought about watching it before and I had heard it was very good, but I never could have guessed it'd be this good.
>> ARTICLE
I watched **Durarara** because it seemed interesting and everyone was hyped for the second season so I had to watch it eventually. I have to say I really enjoyed it. It had a great first episode but left me a bit unsatisfied until the final of the first arc, after that I was completely hooked. My favorite character was Shizuo. I think he was characterizised really well and I just love his attitude.
>> ARTICLE
I liked **Durarara** too, my favorite character was Simon, because russian sushi and his likeable character. I first dropped the show because I was expecting it to be as good as **Baccano!**. I started watching again after the announcement for Season 2 and I did not regret it. But still in my opinion Baccano is a better show. I highly recommend it if you haven't watched it already.

Binge watching Hunter x Hunter. Just finished the Greed Island Arc and a couple episodes into the Chimera Ant Arc. Excited.

Same here. Just about to finish greed island. HxH has fast become one of my favorites. Best shounen on right now and easily one of the best anime of all time.

Really is such a great show. Every one of the arcs could pretty much hold it's own as an independent show, the characters are great (especially the villains), the music is great, storylines are great, great humour but incredibly dark when it needs to and just all round great fun to watch.

Wow really l? I guess it needs to grow on me then seeing as I didn't immediately like the last two either but I dunno the first has to be my favourite followed closely by the third

you have 60+ episodes for it to grow on you. just don't watch the video until all the villains have been introduced.

Man, I wish I could rewatch HxH for the first time. I caught up to it right near the end of the Chimer Ant arc. It was so much fun to watch that show.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I'm going through Chimera Ant arc of the remade series now, but this would be my 4th time going through HxH (Read manga twice, and watched original series although that didn't reach Ants). I still like it, but I'm just not feeling the same excitement as everyone else since I know most of what happens quite well already.
>> ARTICLE
Watched a lot less this week cause of school. But still had time for some. 

**Monogatari Series: Second Season (14-16/26):** Just finished the Nadeko Medusa Arc and skipped the recap. This arc was alright, but I really liked the last two episodes. Cant wait to see what happens [on] (/s "graduation day.") 

**Hunter x Hunter (2011) (5-15/148):** Im pretty much halfway through the Hunter Exams and really enjoying it. My favorite character right now is Killua, he reminds me of Hiei a lot. Kurapika and Gon seem cool. [Still waiting for Leorio to show off some type of hidden power.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/waiting.gif)

**Yosuga no Sora (8-12/12):** This show had a really nice soundtrack, with background music that fit well in the scenes and some nice art. The story was decent. It was different than what I wouldve expected from an ecchi/harem. Even though the characters were either annoying or complete cut-outs. The depth the show put into them, during their respective arcs was exceptional. But the last arc was where the show got interesting. As it showed the relationship between twins without letting it happen, just cause. With Haru actually feeling bad about what he was doing, for the most part, and then coming to his final decision. This show made me feel uncomfortable at times, but was fairly enjoyable. **6.5/10**   
>> ARTICLE
Hunter X Hunter is my favorite anime of all time, it just keeps getting better and better (bar the Greed Island Arc imo). If you like it now you'll absolutely love it by the time the Yorknew City arc comes around. 
>> ARTICLE
O man you're off to a better start than me for HxH, I was pretty bored (I don't know how I marathoned to episode 37). STopped watching it for a bit, then heard that HxH would continue from it's hiatus and hoped the manga would finish so the anime would have a proper end, so I debated and debated and saw some reddit threads saying that Chimera Ant arc was awesome, then i decided to watch HxH, hit chimera ant arc... Then I fell in love with HxH and stopped watching fairy tail and didn't GAF about whether it had a proper ending or not, its a good anime

This is too uncanny. I also watched Monogatari second season and just finished Nadeko's arc and skipped the recap.....

Oh man, you are going to love the final battle in Monogatari. The preview was just the beginning of an entire episode of crazy action!

I am watching White Album 2, and so far I find it incredibly amazing. The romance is very realistic, as of right now I am on episode 8. I hope to finish it today!

I just finished a rewatch of this today (coincidentally, I also watched 8-13). It is so, so satisfying to see a show that handles the romance and drama as well as this show did.

You're definitely in for a ride for the rest of the show.

**Psycho-Pass**  
Just finished watching this series recently! I can't believe I didn't watch it sooner!  
Overall, I thought that it was an amazing series! The plot really began unravelling after the first few episodes and had me captivated until the very end. None of the characters were completely bad or good; there was quite a bit of gray area in terms of the motivation and goals of each character. That's what really made this series interesting! I also can't get enough of the OST for this show! I just love the EDs by EGOIST.  
  
AND....I'm really excited that they announced a second season!

If you love the egoist songs then you should watch Guilty Crown :) It is one of my favorite animes! Psycho-Pass was amazing too though!

> Dont mistake borrowed power for your own ability

Cant say too much has changed from the first half as far as delivery and thats paying the show a huge compliment. What really made me fall in love with the show was its quick pacing and dialog that made no qualms at prodding at its themes and ideologies of its characters. Pair that with a set of insurrections against an established power in order to explore the trappings of imperialism and you have yourself something special in the making. I have little doubt that the show will continue to stand against its age as this really is the pinnacle of what action-adventure with a dash of popcorn can achieve in my book.

Man, [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDvdHTgzLUw) was absolute right when he said this was a super-bromantic anime. Thats a welcomed thing in my book as the role of best friend is often a sidelined device more so than a genuine person that interacts in a believable, familiar way with other members of the cast. And oh boy, do Kaoru and Sentaro [gel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOf3MVMPGOc). Not only that, but they bring with them their own identity issues, anxiety, and familial and social drama to drive the story to some interesting places. Im partial to the design of the characters, especially with how nicely detailed the shading is done. Musical scenes look fantastic. Insert songs are positioned at just the right moments. Really the only gripe I have is that a *certain* character sticks out badly as though he doesnt belong in the series. But really, I dont think we can have enough Watanabe-Kanno collaborations.

[Yup, I can see where the adoration is coming from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t79adaDO6o). Lawrence and Holo bounce off of one another quite well. The OP really carries the tone of the series: serene, mystical, tranquil. A great series to end the evening much like Mushishi but also demands my full attention because I will get lost very easily when the explanations start coming in over the workings of the various transactions that merchants deal in. It gives us a nice glimpse into city structures and the institutions that influence the economy, politics, and nobility as a whole. That being said, the little jabs at the church had me in stitches since they were conveyed in such a subtle manner. Its a charming world seen through the eyes of charming characters, and Im enjoying my stay.

Agreed, it's one series where the OP really does well to serve as an introduction.

>That being said, the little jabs at the church had me in stitches since they were conveyed in such a subtle manner.

I love how the church is portrayed throughout the series (and further in the novels). While it's opposed to Holo's existence as a pagan figure on the whole, it's a massive organization with many moving parts. Depending on the individual they're dealing with, it can either be helpful or obstructive for Holo and Lawrence.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't heard any of the Japanese dub, but the English dub just feels...fitting, given the setting. But that may be because any prior exposure I had to the show was through the English dub.

Sounds like the light novels do a good job of handling complex institutions. I may have to pick them up in the future.

**[ef: a Tale of Memories](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=2924) (12/12)**  
7.5/10. I liked this, I always love some drama/romance with a bummer feel to it. But I sort of wish there were more interactions between the two main storylines. The only real connections were that there were two sisters who texted each other sometimes. I'd almost rather the stories been completely irrelevant in terms of plot than have them so vaguely connected, I dunno. But in general this was neat. Not sure if I should watch **[ef: a tale of Melodies](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4789/ef:_A_Tale_of_Melodies.)**, I've heard mixed reviews.

**[Tokyo Magnitude 8.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=6211) (11/11)**  
6.5/10. I really did not enjoy episodes 1-9 very much at all. Episodes 10-11 were much better (though I won't dare spoil why) but I just can't justify a higher score when I was so bored by the earlier episodes. I might still say it's worth watching just for the ending though.

**[Aiura](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=17082) (12/12)**  
7/10. This was adorable, cute girls doing cute things for ~45 minutes (each episode is about 4 minutes long). No plot but some cute scenarios, some of which actually got me to laugh out loud which is sort of rare for me while watching tv alone.

**[Itazura na Kiss](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=3731) (1-12/25)**  
This is enjoyable so far, I've heard a lot about it and finally got around to watching it. The two leading characters are good (the female lead [growing on me](http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i103/chibi_jupiter/Itazura%20na%20Kiss/Kotoko_pray.png)) but the rest of the characters are pretty weak.

**Ashita no Nadja 35-50 (END):** I think this would be on the list of my favourite anime, if I had one. It perfectly combined all the elements of Ie Naki Ko and Little Princess Sara, and it added romance to the mix. That part reminded my of Cardcaptor Sakura; although the romance wasn't similar, Nadja started to resemble Sakura more and more as it went on.

Like Little Princess Sara, the plot seemed to build everything up and then unravel everything close to the end. I don't think anything went forgotten, and pretty much everything was tied up. Like Ie Naki Ko, the last ~10 episodes upped the pace, the stakes, and shifted the tone of the anime. I found no issue with the type of content changing, however, as the rest was already quite diverse. Romance, adventure, conspiracies, dancing, drama, comedy. It did everything well.

There was quite a distinct look to Nadja, although I believe it was fairly typical for Toei anime of the era. Most backgrounds have a canvas style effect applied to them, which I noticed in Doremi. I believe there were different art designers for each town visited, so they all have a unique look to them (and from what I remember, Granada had the best backgrounds). The animation wasn't bad, although it was limited and rarely stood out. The designs (especially some of the male characters) had a sort of western look to them, and they worked fairly well. 

It has a certain style to it which makes it stand out. Lots of scenes involve characters moving across a static background. The [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTJ6_rChjk) is a good example of it, but I think the last Mamoru Hosoda episode is the best. Some episodes demonstrated a kind of twistedness to perspective, which I also saw in Doremi's magic world. It reminded me a lot of Soul Eater, which Igarashi also directed.

The characters were the strongest point though, by far. Nadja is really the main character, unlike some other shows that try to divvy up time for all the side characters too. Not to say that they don't get the attention they deserve, but episodes purely about them are very limited in number. Nadja's character doesn't expand much from what we initially see until near the end, and she doesn't develop slowly. Instead there are pivotal moments and changes in her outlook. 

The members of the troupe are servicable characters that get characterized quite slowly, and a lot of stuff seems to happen without much attention being drawn to it. Like Kennosuke seeing Rita as a little-sister figure. The real supporting stars are the love interests and the villians, but I can't really say anything without spoiling a lot. I was taken aback by some of the cruelty instigated and the motivations behind it, at least.

I'm just rambling at this point and I don't have much of value to say. Nadja is great: watch it.

**Glass Mask (2005) 1-10/51:** I was going to watch the first LoGH gaiden, but I ended up starting this instead. So far it seems inferior to the manga and the anime is very slowly picking up steam. 

The manga art and style is very distinctive, and it's something I quite enjoy reading through. This anime changes all of that, and opts for the blandest route possible. It changes the tone quite a bit - [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/UfqGCT2.png) in the manga (and a lot of the later parts) give me the same feelings as I get when watching Akagi or Kaiji. It gets quite comically serious at times, which the [anime](http://i.imgur.com/SVWl1KW.jpg) doesn't show. I'm not one to want panel by panel, word for word adaptations (so this scene is a poor example), but the style of the anime is different enough to make the tone completely different. [This](http://i.imgur.com/GBy6ux7.png) is probably better - in the manga it's just a little one page thing that shows how determined Maya is, because she walks along the tracks all night. In the anime, she walks during the day and gets there during the day, so there isn't as much context. I didn't get the same impression at all from it.

I'm sure lots of things are being skipped in the adaptation, which is no surprise as it adapts something like 40 volumes in just 51 episodes. So far, I dont' remember what I've missed, so that's okay. It all seems coherently put together.

One thing I will commend it on is the selection of Maya's seiyuu: at first she sounded very different to what I imagined, but I soon realised what impressive range she has, and how her plainness fits Maya just right.

Many characters are unrecognisable because they changes the time period from the 70s to the 2000s, so they no longer worse fashion of the era. 


**Sailor Moon R 4-22/43:** I still don't know how to feel about this. I didn't like the Doom Tree arc, but the current one is passable, and the villians are moderately entertaining. I don't mind Chibiusa's problems, but I feel that she's taking screen time from the other senshi. It just doesn't seem as polished as the first season to me.
>> ARTICLE
**[Katanagatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6594/Katanagatari): 4-12/12.**

This was quite an adventure. Togame's distinct personality really started to grow on me. Character development wise, Shichika's growth as a person was truly amazing and seeing Togame change as well was great. [Ep 11](/s "Togame's death had me very conflicted, but when thinking about it further, it was all necessary for the themes of this show.") Overall, this was one great anime.

**9.5/10**

**[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure \(2012\)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14719/JoJos_Bizarre_Adventure_\(2012\)): 5-15/26.**

At first I really couldn't believe the ending of the first arc to the second arc--I thought it was impossible to do that. But with the "revamp" of "JoJo" this series is taking a more fundamental route to it's conflict, and it's getting really interesting, especially with our cocky, tactical JoJo at hand.
>> ARTICLE
Glad you feel the same way about Episode 11! Shichika's fights in the last episode make everything worth it and it's such a fantastic finale.

It's been a while since I've seen it but I believe [Katanagatari spoilers](/s "the reason her snake-eye was showing was because she was scheming when she lied to him.

One of the most exciting animes I've seen in a while, it's nice to get all that hype and badassery in one place.

>> ARTICLE
I am actually currently watching that! It was on my to-watch list just after Kill la Kill. I've heard a *lot* of great things about it, so I'm pretty excited. 
>> ARTICLE
I may be in the minority, but I went from Kill la Kill to Gurren Lagann and felt that there was a huge disparity between the two. Gurren Lagann is good if I look back on it as a whole, but only a couple of episodes really gripped me (compared to every Kill la Kill episode courtesy of Mako's monologues)
>> ARTICLE
So, would you recommend watching Gurren Lagann first?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I would. Honestly I can understand why people like TTGL so much, but I have trouble getting into anything that doesn't have well developed characters (I'd attribute three good characters to TTGL out of a large cast)
>> ARTICLE
I liked Kill la Kill, it was new, cool and pretty awesome. TTGL just has this epicness that doesn't stop building up and I don't know many animes that top it (at least for myself). I'd say watch KLK first because TTGL blows it out of the water. Both awesome though, and just very different. 
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely imagine that! Kill la Kill is just so exciting, constant action and humor all mixed into one. I doubt anything can really compare to its uniqueness. Most likely I'll go into Guren Lagann with a whole different mindset. I hope to enjoy it, even if it is less intense than Kill la Kill is.

Well that was one hell of a way to finish closing things out. The last episode of it all though with Revy's scene of going through her past was pretty fucking dark. I wasn't prepared for that at all.

I've been on a spree to watch shows with a second season coming soon, so...

**Log Horizon (25/25)** - This is what I wanted Sword Art to be. It focuses very heavily on the *game* aspect of the show, instead of just using it as an excuse to be a generic fantasy setting. It was much more political and much less action orientated than I had assumed it would be, but I really liked that. 

It was a little hand-wavey on the how they got into the game. The one wizard said someone used World Magic to alter the game, but that implies this game world actually exists in reality. If that was the case, I don't really understand how it existed as a world before that. Did the game before act as a kind of portal to controlling the character in the other world or...? Ehh, it's all left too vague to really understand, but it's not really that important, at least for now.

But one thing that really got on my nerves was how they would stop two or three times per episode and say something along the lines of "When this was a game" or "Back before the Apocalypse" to explain a basic function of the game. I get that it's trying to appeal to everyone and make it easy to understand for anyone with no MMO experience, but it was for every. single. minor. detail.

All that said, it's still fantastic and I'm eager for the new season. Akatsuki best girl.

**Chaika the Coffin Princess (12/12)** - I'm mixed on this one. I feel like I should rate it higher than I what I did. There wasn't anything inherently wrong with it - the animation was good, although a little QUALITY at times, the soundtrack was nice, the setting and story were both good too, and it was pretty funny. Maybe it's just not my type of show, but this series never really grabbed me.

The characters were fun. Chaika was cute as hell, and MCs sister had me busting out laughing from time to time. [Chaika? Yes, Chaika](/s "Fredrika's revival was the funniest and most unexpected thing I've seen in a long time. I had to pause to catch my breath for a few minutes after that.") But again, they never really clicked for me and I didn't really get attatched to any of them.

But that's really just my own preferences. If Fantasy like this is what you like, then you'll probably love this show, but for me, it didn't really do anything.

As for what's next, I plan on starting Psycho Pass soon, and reading at least the Fate path of F/SN before those two start up. S'gonna be a good next few weeks.

I re-watched the entirety of the first season of Log Horizon one night this week and I really enjoyed it all over again. I'm really excited about the second season coming this fall while I'm also really curious as to how they're going to do 25 episodes. I get the feeling like they might adapt part of the spin-off manga about Soujirou from the West Wind Brigade since it's a really entertaining story with very little overlap with the main story.

[Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) (1-10/26)

Been many years since I watched this on Adult Swim so it's nice to finally see all those episodes that you never watched. (because really, what teen cared to tape shows without today's standard DVR functions)

Every episode has been great for the most part. Good characters, good plot, so far every angel battle has been different, the little bit of fan service is nice too. I'm excited to get [congratulated](/s "CONGRATULATIONS")

so far a 9/10 for me

[Serial Experiments Lain](http://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain) (10-13/13)

Really ambitious 90s anime that touches on a lot of interesting topics but I truly struggled when half the episodes felt like silence and staring. Many of it's computer/The Wired concepts were just too strange/outdated (laser pointer goggles?). On a positive note: unique art style, interesting character interactions, good character development of Lain, good ending.

6/10

[Hotarubi no Mori e](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10408/Hotarubi_no_Mori_e) (1/1)

Really cute... short? movie? I dunno but anyways if you haven't watched it yet you might as well since it's like 40 minutes long and its pretty good for the most part. [spoilerinos](/s "I did feel cheapened out with the ending, why's this random little kid got to fuck everything up?")

I wanted to finish Ouran Highschool Host Club before today. I thought I would. Then I played 25 hours of Borderlands 2, watched numerous hours of Destiny streams, and the League of Legends World Championships started. Well, I did get through some stuff, so let's run down the list.

###**Ouran High School Host Club episodes 20-21:**

Episodes 20-21 pushed us the twins' stories again, showing us their past, and showing us somewhat of their present. They saw themselves as two that are one, and were eager for someone to come barging in, to separate them, to show them they have individual worth, and to make them more than two, but also less than "one joint entity", even as they feared that activity actually happening - and it was really nice that Tamaki's answer reflected this, [spoiler for episode 20](/s "that the twins wanted something but also kept pushing against it.")

The bit about the twins that keeps coming back to me about Haruhi is how Kaoru says Hikaru wants Haruhi, but thankfully for Kaoru he doesn't realize that yet, but doesn't Hikaru also want Kaoru, but is unwilling to admit that, including to himself, because Hikaru, who is more brash and open with how he's acting expressed said interest first? Hm. There's a lot to unpack about the twins, should one desire, and the show's doing a good job at it, and even when it's spelling it out, it feels worthwhile, rather than hitting us on the head, even if we figured it out for ourselves, because Tamaki realizing it is meaningful, and him telling the twins what they are but unconscious of also rang true.

###**Sora no Woto episodes 4-7.5:**

Watched with /u/animeclub, so in case you want per-episode breakdown, [here's the write-up for episodes 3-5](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ghgsq/anime_club_watch_24_sora_no_woto_35_spoilers/ckjgaie), and [here's the one for episodes 6-7.5](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2gscn2/anime_club_watch_24_sora_no_woto_675_spoilers/ckm3b6u).

First thing first, due to the tonal change, I recommend either watching episode 7.5 after episode 6, though it makes a tiny reference that might not make sense, because it follows up on episode 6's events, and tones, and because it somewhat backtracks from what episode 7 does. Alternately, watch it after the season ends, it's an OVA, with the sort of material to expect from such.

This is a nice little show, but that's most of what it is - "nice". The characters are comforting in the manner that meeting the same tropey-characters you've met in countless other series are. You've got the tsundere underclassman, the girl who will be positive no matter what, the motherly leader... they still feel as if you could map most of them perfectly onto K-On! archetypes.

This show has three "moods", so to speak. The first is the easy-going "native state", where characters go along, have fun, or comfort one another. Here we see that the characters are painted with a broad-brush, not just in terms of tropiness, but also in how they're relatively simple, or even simplistic, as if someone used pop-culture psychology with an injection of media-tropes to paint the "conflicts" and "feelings". We have a case where someone acts brattish, so we say she's hurt because she lost her mother - everything has an easy to define reason that's readily apparent. And the other characters go "It's my fault, because I mentioned my family!" or "It's my fault, because I wasn't a good enough replacement parent!" - I mean, come on, that's not how real people speak, but people who watched too many corny dramas in order to learn how to be people.

But that mode is sort of the standard for "moe slice of life", what's more interesting are the next two mode-moods. The first is when the series is going for "hyper-serious", where it tries so hard to be serious that I can't take it seriously and burst out laughing. The OVA was going for this mood, and it was intentional. There was also episode 6 where [spoilers](/s "the characters literally dressed as gangsters in order to fool other gangsters"), but the very moment the series even *tried* to be "serious", I felt it was ridiculous, and knew something was up. It might be intentional at times, but it also removes some of the tension, as I know what's coming. But there was also episode 3 where Kanata fell, sick, and I couldn't take it seriously due to the over-the-top reaction from Rio, though in world it was something to worry about, you know?

And then there was episode 7, which was serious in a serious manner, and it worked. It was similar to how in episode 3, when we saw a scene of Rio's mother in a flashback, it worked. The series works as a serious one not when it tells us that it's serious, and tries to "act" mature, but when it just gives us that content straight. The world is one that's not merely post-apocalyptic, but one that's still continuing its slow and inevitable slide to ruin. The question asked about whether it's worth living was worthwhile, but the answer provided was half-hearted.

It's a nice series, and it's a very beautiful series, but there are many things holding it back from being great, or even "good". But if it'd continue as it did in the 7th episode, it'd graduate to that point, and maybe even higher. The question is how does the show want to juggle these two aspects.

###**5 Centimeters Per Second / Byousaku 5 Centimeter:**

I've watched Voices of a Distant Star in a film festival around 2003. I've ordered the DVD of The Place Promised in Our Early Days as soon as it went up on Amazon. Meaning, though I've fell behind on most anime films from 2007 onward, I consider myself a fan of Makoto Shinkai.

But I didn't like this film. I ended up giving it 7/10, but even that is due to respecting what it was doing, and thinking it did some stuff well. This is a case where I think the film was mechanically sound (I include direction here), and artistically satisfying in terms of themes and exploration, but I just did not enjoy it, because it felt cold and alien, as if it had no soul.

This movie felt like what you'd get if you took The Garden of Words, and removed anything resembling emotions from it, anything resembling humanity. Considering The Garden of Words later, I'd say he learned from the experience (Children Who Chase Lost Voices will hopefully be watched next week). But that's not entirely fair. Makoto Shinkai's films are always about the same things - they're about distance. Distance, as a concept, also incorporates "closeness", and his films are also about emotions, and loneliness, and one way to show these aspects to us is by showing us a series of people on their own, and in not really showing us their feelings reach across.

After all, emotions reaching across, and emotions not reaching across? It revolves around the same theme, and often in the same manner, it's just that one is more engaging and rewarding to watch, and one less so. When your characters keep being clinical, the work often does as well. No, it's not always so, and I know I've seen counter-examples, but I'm talking of this particular instance.

Takai going to meet his "girlfriend", a 13 year old who went on a 3 hour train-ride, that was quite dedication, [tiny spoilers](/s "and then it lasted *7 hours*.") I could feel his pain, as I sometimes do when trapped on public transportation, or back when I had to take 6-8 hours' worth of public transportation on 3-4 hours' notice back in my military-service days. I was reminded of that feeling of loneliness, of the reminder that "light" is such a tiny thing, and how most of what's out there is stark nothingness whenever I had to ride the bus at night.

[minor spoilers](/s "I did wonder why he didn't call her, or ask for someone else's cellphone"), but then as the movie progressed I understood it was back in 1998 or earlier, when cell-phones weren't common. It's really interesting to think about how we used to live when you couldn't get in touch with people who were coming your way, and how people dropped off the network for 2-3 hours at minimum whenever they left the house. I sometimes think of it, and it's a perfect thing for Shinkai to explore, and a bit more on that next paragraph.

When the second vignette opened, with the dream, [and](http://i.imgur.com/iGWs5dw.jpg) [all](http://i.imgur.com/18QqK3v.jpg) [those](http://i.imgur.com/KMxR0qs.jpg) [very](http://i.imgur.com/XFMa3uD.jpg) [beautiful](http://i.imgur.com/qRArDoO.jpg) [shots](http://i.imgur.com/OC1IINU.jpg), I wondered for a moment if we're actually in a sci-fi story, or if there was some *major* time-skip, because suddenly we were back in Voices of a Distant Star! But no, though he *did* have a rocket launch to space appear. Space and other dimensions are something that constantly appear in Shinkai's works, because his works deal with the concept of "distance", or "closeness", so tools to bridge that gap, be they phones, or letters, are integral, but space, well, that's easy - space is a metaphor for space, of wanting to go somewhere else, of taking time, of one way trip, of reaching, forever reaching, from the beginning of one's life, of one's species, to eternity.

This film has a lot going for it, it's pretty, it's got its ideas in check, it has relatable human moments... it just fails to actually, well, make a connection, and close the distance. How ironic.

> Sora no Woto

I tried watching this on Crunchyroll a few weeks back. I was enjoying it, but they kept calling the bugle a trumpet and I couldn't deal with it and stopped watching. Argh.
>> ARTICLE
You sure you're not confusing Rio and Kanata's instruments? One's a bugle, and one's a trumpet.

Also, I snickered.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I watched a couple more episodes to confirm. The word they use is *rappa* (), which seems to mean any trumpet or horn-like instrument.
Bugle is common enough that a translator should know to use it though. Something interesting I found is that the top search result for  is the Japanese Wikipedia page for bugle, not trumpet.

>Also, I snickered.

Indeed, that is easily the most unreasonable reason I have stopped watching something. I'll probably finish it now that I've started again.
>> ARTICLE
Considering they don't even know the name of the language "Japanese", and are amazed that there used to be life in the ocean, you should think of it as the characters having lost some of the terminology employed by us :3
>> ARTICLE
> This movie felt like what you'd get if you took The Garden of Words, and removed anything resembling emotions from it, anything resembling humanity.

Funny enough I feel the except opposite. For me Garden of Words couldn't carry over the emotions and only relied on [GoW Spoiler](/s "the last encounter between the two ")which I by then didn't care enough (I did, but not as much as in 5cm) about.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not surprised, whichever opinion you hold, you'll find people who hold the opposite :)

That doesn't make you any less wrong, of course (That's a joke, but increasingly, I feel the need to spell it out).

**Fullmetal Alchemist The Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa**


Fullmetal Alchemist's ending is a huge cliffhanger, but is also very satisfying in its own way. Conqueror of Shamballa is set two years after the events of FMA and provides closure for the series. All in all, the movie's pretty good. The animation is way better than it is in the TV show, there a few brand new and likeable characters, and the old one's are still there too. Unfortunately, there was something that I didn't quite like about it, I'm not sure what. I just felt like it could have been much better than it was. It was very entertaining and wraps up the story nicely, but it was a bit of a step down from the show and left me feeling disappointed. It's still good and totally worth watching, though. I gave it an 8/10 on MAL.


**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann** (7/27)


Man, I still keep accidentally typing "Gurenn Laggan" instead of "Gurren Lagann." Anyway, I'm enjoying the absolute fuck out of this show. It's such a treat, and I totally get why it so widely praised in the anime community. The characters are great, the story's interesting, the art style and animation are fluid and *ooze* style, it's funny, and is overall just a hell of a great show.
>> ARTICLE
> Unfortunately, there was something that I didn't quite like about it, I'm not sure what. 

For me it was that, to some degree, it undermined the central theme of the entire work before it - that to gain anything, you have to be willing to sacrifice and that trying to dodge around that tends to end in tragedy. In the finale of the series, Ed made that sacrifice for the sake of his brother, and then the movie just magically undoes it for the sake of a happier (except for poor Winry) ending. It just rang slightly hollow. 

I had the same issue with Madoka: Rebellion and its treatment of Sayaka's arc. Still enjoyed both that and Conqueror of Shamballa overall, but the faint sour taste remains.

**Attack On Titan 25/25**  
Pretty dissapointed in the pacing of the first half of the series, it got better in the second half but it looked that the anime was running out of the source material. Don't know if I'll watch S2 as it airs. Score: 8.
>> ARTICLE
Attack on Titan's a weird one, where the anime is very good the less you know about what actually good anime is. That's why it's a very good starter anime, especially if someone were to simply marathon it. Besides that my biggest complaint with it would be Tetsuro Araki's direction, which didn't take enough liberties from the manga to be *completely* satisfying, especially regarding pacing.
>> ARTICLE
I watched [**Shiki**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7724/Shiki) after /u/PumpkynPye convinced me to with their review [last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2gdysb/what_have_yall_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cki7t55). 

I didn't enjoy it quite as much as they did, but I still really liked it. I've never been a fan of vampire/supernatural stuff at all, so the fact that I enjoyed this as much as I did does speak something for the show! 
 
I personally thought the show had a really weak first half, and I didn't get incredibly drawn into the show until [episode](/s "14"). The second half was great though, and I'd definitely recommend the show to anyone. I gave it an 8/10, but that's because the second half of the show made the anime for me entirely - if I had only seen the first half, it probably would just be a 6. (I also haven't watched the specials yet, been putting them off for a few days). 

I also watched [**Tonari no Seki-kun**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18139/Tonari_no_Seki-kun) in between episodes of **Shiki** as a kind of palate-cleanser, and to make it easier for me to sleep at night. :P This short was absolutely hilarious and adorable, and I would love to see more of it. Great length for me to just watch 2 or 3 every night before going to sleep. 
>> ARTICLE
**Haibane Renmei** (ep1-end)  
Highly thought provoking. I wouldn't recommend it to everybody because of it's slow pace and slice of life-ish nature, but the rich context and the character make up for all of it. (Rated 9/10 on MAL)
>> ARTICLE
Just finished **Wolf's Rain** last week and I am glad that I watched it the second time. I found so many allusions that I can relate to my adult life. Didn't know how to interpret the ending. It seems that paradise does not exist or.. like happiness, can only be chased and cannot be fully attained. 

The series has aged well (was surprised that it was originally aired on 2003) and felt like watching an anime classic/legend.

Currently on **Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World** but is having trouble on getting myself to really watch it. The art style is kinda dated and the episodes does not flow from one to the next to keep me engaged. I know what the show is trying to tell but I feel that I'd rather read it than watch it. For now 2 episodes per week works for me.
>> ARTICLE
**Eden of the East + 2 Movies**

The series was pretty good, it kept me wanting for more. The direction and mystery was particularly interesting however the end of the series itself wasn't fulfilling and led me wanting more. An 'alright' 7/10.

The movies however were an absolute mess. The mysteries were met with anticlimatic resolutions, plotholes were rampant and there was an overload of information. I guess it just didn't really suit me. 4/10.

>> ARTICLE
I watched the first movie and came away pretty disappointed. Nothing seemed to really happen. Is it even worth picking up the second?
>> ARTICLE
probably not. it gives a resolution, but not much closure. if you didn't like how the direction of the first movie was going i'm quite sure the second wouldn't be your cup of tea.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass since it was recommended to me by a friend if i wanted to watch an anime where the main character is WAY too smart for there own good. Loved it except for one thing: Suzaku. I like his mindset but sometimes his actions don't match up that mindset. Both Lelouch & Suzaku do the exact same thing then Suzaku pretends that he's morally right for doing it yet criticizes Lelouch the same thing. Also spin kicks. Lots of spin kicks.

I watched **Neon Genesis Evangelion** for the first time. I haven't watched the End of Evangelion yet, and my thoughts on the series are still quite nebulous. (And probably will be for some time to come.) All I know for sure is that [NGE](/s "Freud would love this shit.")

I've been sick from work so without further ado:

Angel beats
AnoHana
Clannad + after story + movie
Suzimiya haruhi no yuuutsu

Deadman wonderland
Mirai nikki
Another

I don't know where to go anymore, I have no feels left after watching angel beats and clannad, and anohana between clannad and clannad AS. I honestly don't know where I'll find anime with the same quality of animation and soundtracks as AB and clannad. I listen to the OST for AB and I just keep getting shivers and a lump in my throat. I loved Kanades personality as well as I loved Tomoyo and Kyou in clannad (ovas ftw). 

Sad to see that Deadman Wonderland was discontinued, loved the concept. Also didn't really grasp Suzimiya haruhi but I haven't watched the movie yet so. That's what I've watched this week!

**Kara No Kyoukai**: (5/7?)

This movie series is really, really good so far. I'm starting to understand more of the story. But of course the 5th movie threw this enormous curve ball at me and I'm lost again. Shiki as a character is great and love the way she plays out through the story.

**Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo**: (24/24)

Holy cow this show made me cry so hard. Episode 23 was very emotional and man, I enjoyed it so much. I know a lot of people look at the plot and conflicts through out the story as forced, and it is mostly true, but I was able to look past it and enjoy it for what it was. I feel like the amount of drama was a little over bearing, but the happy and silly parts of the show was able to satisfy me. I give 8.5/10 

**Nodame Cantabile**: (6/23)

So far i'm enjoying this show, but I'm anxious to see more of the serious side of the romance if it does come. I enjoy the funnies that the show puts out and the seriousness Chiaki has for his need to be a conductor is okay (even though he seems to want to do whatever he wants just to show he is worthwhile). I'm just hoping that some romantic growth happens between Chiaki and Nodame during this season.

I watched the first season of K-On! and I have to say, I never expected to like this show as much as I did.  I'm confused about the order to proceed though, is it movie then season 2 or the other way around.  I only ask because the movie only has 1 exclamation point like season 1 and season 2 has 2!
>> ARTICLE
Are you me? I just finished S1 of K-On too and surprisingly liked it more than I thought I would. The show always seemed to be one of those overhyped types of show that is just average or kinda crappy but it did a pretty good job as SOL.

**C3: Cubed Cursed Curious**

A very mediocre show. I thought the characters were bland and the story was nothing to write home about. Also the fanservice really got on my nerves...It's art is pretty good though.

**4/10**

**Nobunagun**

Overall it was a pretty fun show. Characters were fun, Battles were fun and from what I remember of the soundtrack it was pretty good as well. I'd definately watch a second season if one ever gets made. 

**7/10**
>> ARTICLE
**Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou** (Completed)

This show is the epitome of mediocrity. The fan service doesn't even do it any good. Well, at least I enjoyed it. *Only a little though*


**Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World** (Episode 0-2)

It's been pretty good. I had mixed thoughts at first because of the "Talking Motorcycle" thing, but I'm actually enjoying the great writing of the story and the characters.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if this counts but I binge watched log horizon after a post last week. It was a comic for sword art online with kirito screaming that he's in a nightmare and there are nice butts everywhere.

Anyways I saw a gif of one of the characters sweeping to strobe lights saying database database wow wow wow wow wow and then the thread derailed into a best waifu fight. 

Needless to say I was intrigued and then watched the first season (not knowing there was going to be another one at the time) and loved every minute of it. It managed to put children into an anime that I don't hate, which is a skill. Also I don't think I've paused a show of anything so much because I was laughing my ass off on episode 22. 

If you are looking for a new show, I'd highly recommend it. DATABASE DATABASE WOW WOW WOW WOW.

I watched [Angel Beats!](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=6547) at the beginning of the week. wow that show was fantastic and so emotional. hit me pretty hard so I thought I'd go with some easy stuff for the weekend so I watched [Mirai Nikki](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=10620) which was rly cool and turned out much better than I expected (and not that easy...) and damn do I like [Gasai Yonu](http://myanimelist.net/character/4963/Yuno_Gasai) !

yeah I thought that it couldn't get much worse when they told [the story of](/s "Yui's life") but damn the [story of](/s "Kanade's reason to be in this afterlife was so emotional I even shed a tear or two which doesn't happen very often")

I watched both of those over the summer, both are enjoyable!

If you liked the hardcore parts of Mirai Nikki check out **[Deadman Wonderland](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland)**. It doesn't really have an equivalent of Gasai Yuno (who I thought was the best thing about Mirai Nikki) but it has a similar feel nonetheless!

yeah yuno was the best char on this show for sure and after every episode I wanted to know what things she will do on the next ep. thx for the Deadman Wonderland advice will definitely watch it in the near future

* **Tengen Toppa Gurrenn Lagann**: I really enjoyed it. One of the best show I've watched. It's so over the top and I'm pretty sure the ones who made it were aware of it. [I made a post about it 5 days ago,](http://www.reddit.com/r/gurrenlagann/comments/2gihio/finished_ttgl_11_hours_well_spent/) and I still feel the same until now.

* **Nichijou**: Eating, drinking, or anything you're doing that involves something with your mouth is a bad idea while watching this show. I laughed so hard that it made me cry, and I had to pause and walk around before continuing. I wish I can have a personal Nano. Or have a friend like Mai. The only parts where I didn't laugh is every scene where Hakase is on screen. But it doesn't take away much from my enjoyment, so I still gave it a 10/10.

* ~~**Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!? (Episode 1-4)**: For the life of me I can't pronounce or spell the name of this show. It's been pretty average so far. I'm surprised that most the VAs are just amateurs, I personally think they're doing a great job (especially Sanae and Yukina's VA). I'm not sure why people like Yukina so much that she has 80+ favorites on MAL over the others, but I guess I'll see in the later episodes. I feel like Kurano is just there and doesn't really blend in with the others other than the fact that she has biggest tits among them. I'll see if the characters get any better.~~ **Nevermind. It's still airing.**

**[Hunter x Hunter: The Last Mission](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19951) (1/1)**

Not as good as the first movie, or the series. It has a rather weak story, but not enough to completely bore me. There was some stuff that I didn't know about the HxH universe that I learned from this movie, which was nice. **6/10**

**[Mushishi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/457) (16-26/26) + [Mushishi Special: Hihamukage](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21329) (1/1)**

This has a much faster pace compared to the original series. Looking forward to seeing how it turns out.

**[Kill la Kill Special](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21659) (1/1)**

This special felt kind of unnecessary, but at least we get more Kill la Kill. **6/10**

**[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601) (22-22/22)**

I also went into this show without any prior knowledge (it's fun starting shows you know nothing about!). It also was very enjoyable. I'm interested in seeing how the second season turns out. **8/10**

**[Squid Girl](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8557) (7-12/12)**

The comedy in this series gets old after the first four episodes or so, but not enough to completely ruin the experience. **6/10**

**[Break Blade (TV)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22433) (12-12/12)**

Basically the six movies put into twelve episodes, nothing much. **6/10**

After watching three Urobuthcer animes recently, my emotions needed a rest. So I started **The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya** today. I tried watching it once before but the episode ordering confused me more than I would like to admit and I ended up watching a few episodes out of the normally out-of-order...um, order (?). I have the episodes labeled with the 2009 re-broadcast order and I think that added to the confusion. Anyways, I'm watching it in the original broadcast order because I like stories that jump around in time.

I'm really enjoying it...I love Haruhi! She's got so much attitude and couldn't care less about the rules or normal way of doing things. I just finished the baseball episode and I like how all of the characters have wildly different personalities. I have to say I feel pretty bad for Mikuru with the way Haruhi is always taking advantage of her :-P

Way less than normal but well these:

- Asura Cryin'
- Kyonyuu Try!: Tanki Shuuchuu Chichi Momi Lesson
- Tennen Koi-iro Alcohol
- Chichiiro Toiki 
- Hidan no Aria Special
- Hidan no Aria 
- Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou
- Moyashimon Returns
- Moyashimon CGI Anime
- Moyashimon: Kin Gekijou Deluxe
- Moyashimon 
- PES: Peace Eco Smile - Drive your Heart 
- PES: Peace Eco Smile 
- Mujaki no Rakuen

Mostly the reason because a lot of these shows (other than Moyashimon) was rather boring and with the start of college I've got less time to spend on anime, but oh well let's see what the next week offers me!

[Mirai Nikki](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=10620) 18-26

Not the best stretch, but I enjoyed the series nonetheless. I would definitely not recommend though because its pretty polarizing based on your preference of 1 character. 

All 3 Madoka Movies, first 2 is just a summary. Then I watched [Rebellion](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=11981). Wut I don't even. Coincidentally, it's also largely based on 1 character. 50/50 completely split on recommending this, it's a great movie, but still...

[Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=2966) 1-13 Season 1

Pretty good anime for winding down, considering what I watched just before this. Was sitting on my plan to watch for a long time, but its absolutely brilliant. It's likely I'll be done the second season next week.

>Gundam 0083

It was okay, but the English voice acting sucked. This is coming from a guy who prefers dubs. However, the first OP has my most favorite song in all of anime.

**Inuyasha 102-126**: I quite liked this arc; the Band of Seven human antagonists added a new flavor into the mix. Jakotsu is my favorite. However, after a week of full-canon episodes, I'm not looking forward to wading through terribad fillers again. Because they're so tedious and brain-rotting, it'll probably take me a while to get through them to the next spurt of canon. Inuyasha fillers are almost as bad as Naruto fillers.

Just Nisekoi - on episode 17/20.

It started slow for me and I struggled to want to watch more but it picked up around episode 5 or 6 where I was genuinely interested to see what would happen in the next episode. All the girls are pretty likeable and while there's a clear ['best girl' ](/s "(Onodera)"), I wouldn't mind if any of the other girls won out. 

Story got kinda ridiculous but the characters are still likeable which is surprising coming from a harem. I was informed the manga is still ongoing so my hopes of any sort of closure at the end of the series were vanquished. O wel, going to watch Clannad after this.

All of Gurren Lagann. While I knew a few of the things were supposed to happen, I didn't know I knew them until I saw them happen, which is a good thing. Great series pre timeskip, good series post timeskip. [Especially mad with] (/s Nia going away at her and Simon's wedding. I get the explanation, but I think it was unneccessary story telling that isn't making more sense the more I think about it, if you know what I mean. It made the ending too bittersweet, when they should have gone with a simple somber but happy tone)

I just finished the 6th episode of *Toriko*. Despite it being a shounen show through-and-through, it certainly has a charm to it that makes me occasionally laugh and play along with the series. And considering that *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders* is taking a season-long break, I am in need of a show that delivers silly nonsense.

Polar Bear Cafe. It's adorable and refreshing.

I've been watching **Katanagatari**! My infatuation with Monogatari led me to this, since it is also written by Isin. It is incredibly dialogue heavy which I think sometimes ruins the pacing a bit, but luckily all the characters are interesting so the constant talking is enjoyable. The 50 minute episodes make it a bit daunting to watch through all at once, but I really feel like it works for the show. Doesn't feel rushed, and each episode can stand on its own, like a sort of mini-movie. 

The voice acting is great as well, and the art! Holy shit, I love how everything looks. Definitely has this old japanese painting vibe to it, and the usage of colors and interesting character designs make it one of the most unique anime that I have ever seen. So far it lacks the depth that made Monogatari so amazing for me, but Katanagatari is an absolute blast to watch, and I look forward to finishing it up soon.

**Deadman Wonderland 12/12**

I went into this show wanting a seinen/horror after watching Tokyo Ghoul and this is the first thing I could find. I saw the somewhat bad reviews, but I continued past the the first few episodes because I didn't see anything really bad. [Then we hit the] (/s "rebel arc or whatever you should call it. I was actually enjoying just seeing the deadmen battles and such but the rebel arc came and I kinda just sat there thinking, "you've got to be kidding me" It just felt thrown out there") 

Overall, the first half was good, second half not so much. Struggled to finish

I think calling deadman wonderland seinen might be a little generous.  It's pretty standard shounen fare with some blood for shock value.

**Legend of the Galactic Heroes** 62-86/110

Well, tears. More than I expected. Damn. Damn that episode 83. I was not ready.  
The war was interesting. I have no idea how the losses work, as sometimes they are able to fight for days with 20.000 ships and other times 10.000 ships are destroyed in minutes.  
One thing I noticed is that 1.000.000+ deaths in a battle is pretty much ignored by all population. It has happened in both sides since they beginning of the series. I know their population is considerably bigger (50 bil or something close to that, right? So little less than 10x as big) than ours, but people here would go crazy if 100.000 people died in one side in one battle, heck, they'd go crazy by much less.   
One thing that is has started to annoy me: the Narrator. Those damn spoilers! "And that was the last time they spoke together", "Later historians would consider that was a mistake by him because X"... and so on. Now I'm getting worried about more people!

**Kill La Kill (16/24)**


This. Show. This show is so fun to watch. At first I was a bit iffy about the art style but now that I've gotten used to it, I *love* it. The animation is very impressive and the voice acting is very well done and suits the characters. Anyone that is holding off watching this show, hold off no longer!

**10/10**

I've recently started watching **Baka To Test** and I'm loving it so far! It was recommended to me by a few people as I'm a real sucker for comedies but I've gotta say - so far it's living up to it's name. I'm only on episode 5 thus far, but I've thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. A great watch if you're into comedy.

Watched psycho pass because of all the love for it on this sub. Watched the entire season in 4 days. Then started shiki so far I'm not very far into it and it seems kind of slowly paced

Tari Tari - made me cry from the first few episode to the end. [Tari Tari last episode] (/s "Wanted to punch that insensitive complete jerk of a so called "superintendent". Also wished Wakana didn't go aboard and got in a relationship with Taichi.") I loved everything about it. I loved every episode and it was a ending I could hold on to.

Gin no Saji (first and second season) - One of the best anime I've seen in A LONGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG time. And I tend to binge watch anime everyday if I have time. The OST, character development, the one to one correlation it had with life, and the perfect lessons that came along. This anime is a must watch, IMO. It made me cry and laugh and cry and laugh and cringe and cry and laugh and die a little on the inside just to be revived with a better understanding of the world, and cry some more, and laugh some more, and after all that, it left a hole in a heart. [Gin no saji ending] (/s "I need more from the ending!!!!!!!!!!! It can't end just like that. Please third season! It's not fair. I can't sleep at night with out knowing what happens to the relationship, to the farm, to the studies to everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Feed me more!!!!") I has a rant or a post about this anime somewhere on this subreddit so I'm not going to repeat myself on it but yeah really good anime.

Magical warfare btw ending and the whole show made no sense. Clannad after story I quit after the first episode I can't handle it so I tapped out

I have three shows I am watching while I wait for new episodes of currently airing shows. Mostly I just watch a few episodes at a time.
I am watching **Rock Lee no Seishun**, **Polar Bear Cafe**,  and **Tonari no Seki-kun**, all are very good in my opinion. 

As a large Naruto fan, the Rock Lee spin-off is very funny and generally pokes fun at the show. It's filled with gags and gets crazy sometimes. My interest in it is mostly nostalgic so take that as you will. It's geared toward Naruto fans so check it out especially if you like Naruto.

Polar Bear Cafe is great too. I am half way through and have laughed every episode. It's a calm and witty show with cute talking animals that have joined human society as equals. The characters are hilarious and go on crazy adventures. It's episodic and I recommend it a lot.

The last show is Tonari no Seki-kun and I really like this one. It's perfect for breaks since the episodes are very short. The show centres around two classmates Yokoi and Seki who sit in the back of the class. Seki spends each class doing some kind of distracting activity and Yokoi always ends up getting involved. It's cute and fun so check it out as well.

Finally finished bakemonogatari this week. Really fun so far, but given the hate I'm hesitant to pick up Nisemonogatari.

This week I'm looking at picking up a series or two. Considering Fate and a few others.
>> ARTICLE
Copied/pasted from /r/TrueAnime with some minor editing.


**Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo 24/24**

Lately, I have seen this anime mentioned a lot, often  alongside Toradora! While I still argue that Toradora! is no masterpiece, I did enjoy it a heck of a lot, and knowing the regard that Toradora is held to, to see something recommended alongside it gave me some fairly high expectations. So how did it hold up?


It was decent. The comedy was certainly a focus of the work and I enjoyed it most of the time, but honestly I think that's where the strengths of the series end. Don't get me wrong, I think the characters that we have, with the exception of Nanami are pretty strong, but its just communicated so poorly. Particularly in Mashiro's case. The anime actually went out of its way to tell you how she developed as a character at the end.


My main gripe is how binary the anime is in terms of mood. It was not uncommon for it to grow from lighthearted and fun to extremely depressing within minutes. The drama here was not bad, and the reactions of the characters felt genuine, but the drama felt like it belonged in another show. With this anime you never knew what you were going to get, one episode would be light-hearted throughout, the next would be depressing at first, and then lighthearted, or vice versa. The whole experience just felt disjointed in terms of mood.


Then we get to the graduation scene. As one of the dramatic scenes in Sakurasou, it was probably the best one, but I didn't like how it was resolved, [spoiler](/s "with basically the student body going out of control in the middle of the graduation ceremony.") It went a bit past my suspension of disbelief.


Other than the comedy, my favorite part of this anime was its overall message. That sometimes hard work really doesn't pay off, and there are inevitably going to be people who can achieve something you worked really hard for with little to no perceived effort, however you shouldn't let this discourage you, and you should pursue your dreams anyway.
When every other anime seems to hammer home the idea that hard work is the magic thing that will give you a fulfilled life, its kind of refreshing to see a piece of media acknowledge that you can still fail if you work hard, its still going to sting. It hammers home the idea that perseverance is much more important than working hard.


I gave the anime a 7/10 the comedy was well done, and it had a good message, but it suffers from an inability to communicate character growth effectively, it also has problems shifting the mood in a natural way, which lead to a disjointed experience and really did adversely affect my experience with the series overall.

Watched season 2 of Fate/Zero. So awesome, love that show and it has some of the best characters I've ever seen. Kerei was my favourite, so hilarious and brutal. Definitely going to check out the rest of the Fate series and probably start the VN tomorrow.

I also watched up to episode 13 Hyouka. I forgot how good Kyoani is at animation and this show is really beautiful. Definitely feels like there is something special about his show and I'm lookin forward to the rest of it.
>> ARTICLE
I really miss Hyouka. Hoping for season 2. I recently finished F/Z  and currently on the F/SN 2006.. My fave character would be Gilgamesh. It has memorable characters and the the OST was also good... Can't wait for the UBW route this fall.

I watched all of [Amnesia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15085/Amnesia) because of [this post](http://imgur.com/GivYK2G) last week. I realize the majority of this subreddit is male and maybe won't be familiar with the stuff in the rest of my post, but hey... maybe for those who were curious? 

Despite how popular Uta no Prince Sama still is right now in Japan, I haven't found a reverse harem show based on an otome game that was fulfilling, besides maybe [Hakuouki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6895/Hakuouki). But that may just be because I'm interested in the Shinsengumi. 

Amnesia was interesting in that it was kind of a mystery (you're supposed to find out why the protagonist has lost her memories...hence the title) and that in itself kept you hooked. My interest didn't taper off like it did for say,[ Brother's Conflict](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15605/Brothers_Conflict). However, I'm sure it would've been much more exciting as a dating sim, which is its original form, because you could explore in-depth each of the "boyfriend" options. But that being said, it really wasn't the worst reverse harem based on a game anime that I watched. If I had to suggest an anime of this genre to a guy, or to anyone who wanted to watch this kind of show for something other than being able to ogle 5+ cute guys, I'd suggest this one. The story in itself is a bit supernatural, confusing, and mysterious, and the variety of guys keeps it interesting. Some scenes are actually pretty hilarious too, without meaning to be, like the one with the cage.

But my final thought, for those who watched it too, is that she really should've just stayed in the cage. [ ](/s "I think she was actually the safest in there...considering the world was ACTUALLY out to kill her.")

Yesterday, I re-re-marathoned through the first season of **Log Horizon**, so I can get my brain ready for the upcoming second season. 

Today, I did the same for **Hitsugi no Chaika**, watched bits and pieces of **Jormungand**, and decided to finish watching **Haibane Renmei**, **Noein**, and **Serial Experiments Lain**. I'm going to probably end up rewatching **Noein** and **Lain** in the coming days. I've also LITERALLY just started **RahXephon** right now.
>> ARTICLE
Needed to log in just to reply. RahXephon is probably my favourite show of all time. I found most of the characters super interesting and man... the feels on the bus go round and round. Let me know what you think because no one I talk to has actually watched it. SO GOOD.

Kuragehime! Didn't know it existed until last week, and so happy to have discovered it.

**Hitsugi no Chaika 1-12/12**

When people described it as D&D: The Anime, they're pretty spot on. The majority of the episodes did a great job of capturing that adventure anime sweet spot of discovery, combat, and character interaction. Even with the occasional dip in art quality, every fight scene was incredibly well done, and I felt the dialogue between Toru and Chaika in particular was great. 

Unfortunately, the last few episodes seemed to drag. It's not like they were bad, but they lost a lot of the world-building elements that made the first three quarters of the show so interesting. It also ends on a cliffhanger that's okay for an adventure show, but definitely isn't the kind of "holy shit I need the next season now" hook it could have been (see Aldnoah.Zero.)

That said, I really liked the series. It felt like a great nostalgia trip through my years of playing tabletop RPGs. 7/10, and looking forward to the second half in a few weeks.

**Sakurasou no Pet na Kanajou 1-4/24**

I originally watched Sakurasou when it aired, and gave it a 5/10. The high points are fantastic, but there was a *ton* of repetition and clumsy writing in the second half. Rewatching it now, I'm enjoying the early episodes a lot more this time around, but I'm worried that the rest of the series will turn out exactly as I remember it.

I watched **Log Horizon** as well as the first 4 episodes of **Mushishi** (didn't have time to finish it yet).

About to finish Mirai Nikki..

Just started Golden Time.
>> ARTICLE
I had a lot of free time this week, so I binged through a few entire series.

**Chihayafuru (25/25)**

Like all the best sports anime, the actual game being played matters very little, and the nature of karuta makes audience predictions and strategising entirely moot. Instead, the show uses the game as a lens through which to examine the characters and their relationships to one another and to the game itself. 

All three protagonists are incredibly well-realised. I can only think of a handful of other anime with characters that seem so *human*: flawed, vulnerable, but capable of greatness. The art and character designs are utterly gorgeous and the soundtrack, while unobtrusive, ties the show together. This is a really, really strong show and all too easy to binge through.

**Kaiji Season 2 (26/26)**

So Kaiji is back, still bottom of the pack and in debt to an evil corporation. It's not long before he's dragged in and forced to work in an underground deathtrap, where the hope and life is slowly sucked out of everyone. It's a perfecct illustration of one of Kaiji's major themes, that people are the architects of their own demise; that while evil people will always do evil things, it's usually laziness, procrastination, lack of determination, and a desire for the "easy win" (provided in this case by gambling) that are the root causes behind the majority of human suffering. A little of the fun is lost in season two as the arcs are no longer focused on games where the audience themselves can work out the best strategies by thinking in terms of game theory (as in **Liar Game**, for instance), so you're mostly relying on in-series revelations for the tricks and solutions. Both, however, are still better than the beam-walking section of the first season.

I can see why some complained that the second arc dragged a little, with its inhuman pachinko antagonist and the interminability of the final showdown. I have to say though that the later episodes are the tensest stuff I've ever seen in a show. Too tense, really, if you're binging through them - I found myself skipping through for the pressure release, which was just as cathartic as you'd hope for. 

**Mushi-shi Season 2 (10/10)**

Not much to say about this really, since it's essentially identical to the first season. If you liked or loved that, which I did, you'll really enjoy this. There has been a slight step up in the character designs, where you can actually tell the people in different episodes apart more easily (there was a tendency to repeat haircuts and facial structures in S1). The stories also seemed slightly darker in general, though that was certainly present before, too. It's still a truly beautiful show, and nothing short of breathtaking in certain scenes.

**Hal (film) (1/1)**

I'd seen ads for this come up on the sponsored link section of Reddit for a while, and finally decided to see what the fuss was about. It's an interesting enough story and a nicely "realistic" sci-fi setting. It reminded me a bit of the film "Robot & Frank" but with a romantic twist to it. I certainly don't regret watching it, but it's definitely in the "good" rather than "great" camp.

I also started up **The Devil is a Part-Timer**, which is shaping up to be just as good as people say it is. I'm a huge fan of deadpan absurdit humour, and this is a pretty stellar example so far.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on mobile so I can't quite format properly so bear with me here. 

I don't know of this counts but I just finished the entire monogatari series. (Bakemonogatari, second season, etc)

Let me say this, It was dialogue heavy.  I felt like it had tons of plot and character development and to say the least, it was amazing. I really enjoyed every episode especially the Nekomonogatari short mini series. It was an emotional roller coaster of feels to the end.

Some people have some different views on monogatari: second season. Many dislike because of the fan service and what not but overall it was an enjoyable season. I think it gets a lot of unnecessary hate.   

I've also heard that they're making a movie or something?(someone help me out here) 

My overall rating would be 9.5/10. It was honestly one of the most enjoyable series out there.

Finished **Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou** (The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior). Such a fun and sweet show. I really loved the characters, animation, and comedic style. Every episode had good laughs and aww moments. Ritsu was the most relatable character I've seen in a while.

Also finished **Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko** (Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl). Took me a while to get through it, only because I was watching a lot of other stuff. Not too thrilled with the ambiguous ending because I'm not smart enough to process that stuff, but it was still a very enjoyable series. 

Trying to find some new stuff to start. I did get into the first couple episodes of **Robotics;Notes**, and that seems pretty fun so far. I also just watched the first episode of **Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo** (The Pet Girl of Sakurasou), which is looking like a good follow-up to Kawaisou.

O_O what's with people putting **Log Horizon** as not a not currently airing show?  Technically I guess yes, new episodes are not being shown this exact moment but season 1 ended in late march and season 2 starts in 2 weeks.  That's like people saying **The Walking Dead** is a show currently not airing because season 4 ended March 30th but returns with season 5 October 12.

I know the title only specifies not part of Summer 2014 but really?

I'm a little more than halfway through **Speed Grapher** myself though.  Pretty cool, not super amazing but interesting set-up.  Blatent hypersexualization and conspiracy-ish undertones were what drew me to it in the first place.

**Ano Natsu de Matteru** | *12/12*  
I really loved this anime! Even though there were so many clichs, I truly loved it, and the ending was really powerful too, in my opinion.  
I really like all the characters but since I have finished it in 1 day I can't remember the names..  
**6/10, decided to give it a six because of the clichs, but that doesn't not make it one of my favourite anime.**

Can't wait when the OVA is translated by Commie!  

**Hokuto no Ken/Fist of the North Star** | *22/109*  
Why haven't I seen this Anime sooner? I just finished the Shin arc and although I kinda expected how it was going to end, it still hit me.  
I really like how badass he his, and what he says, things like: "Omae wa m shinde iru" is really cool and I love the "ATATATATATATA"s he does a lot. Still yet to hear the one used in prophunt.  
Would recommend this Anime. Just a mindless Shounen, a lot of fun. 
**7/10**


**Anohana; The Flower we saw that day + the Movie** | *11/11 + 1/1*  
Very different of a lot of other Anime, I have not found any *big* clichs, which is very good. There's no real hero, that solves it all, no they all have to solve it together. It's really good. [minor relationship spoiler](/s "I just wished Anjou and Jinta's relation ship developed further, but not really. I really liked Anjou, and she would seem a good fit with Jinta. Oh well.  ")  
They also really let you feel the obsession they have, which really pulls me into the Anime even more.  
Most of you have probably already seen it, and if not. Watch it, it's really good.  
**8/10, developing of other relationships would be cool, but there's really quite a darngood reason for that it doesn't happen.**

*[Ano Natsu de Matteru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11433/Ano_Natsu_de_Matteru)*

Binge-watched this today (started two episodes yesterday before going to bed) and I really much enjoyed it, hit the right feelings and made me laugh out loud sometimes.
Liked the characters (Remon best and most badass girl in the series), although I am not really the one who you need to ask about likeable characters because I rarely hate a character in any show. 

*[Plastic Nee-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10711/Plastic_Nee-san)*

Because of this [[link]
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkXJ8hKqtOA) and a comment, which praised the comedy I started watching it but realising that I don't really like it, I stopped watching after episode 3. Normally I like random humor but maybe this is too random for me. Also I have the feeling that the OP and ED together are longer than the episodes themself.



*[Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou)*

Started watching it because Holo got so far in the Best Girl Contest and because of a review which praised the characters of this show. I like it so far (especially Holo) but it didn't really "grabbed" me yet. I normally watch one episode per day before I go to bed.
>> ARTICLE
I finished No Game No Life a couple of hours ago. I really enjoyed it. I really liked the art style but now I gotta wait for a second season :(

I also started waching Mawaru Penguindrum last week. I have no fucking clue what is going on (I'm 6 episodes in.)
>> ARTICLE
Enjoy Penguindrum while it lasts because it all goes to convoluted shit somewhere around the halfway mark.
>> ARTICLE
I just started Penguindrum also this week. 15 episodes in and I still can't quite put my finger on this anime. I like it and I am not too sure why.
>> ARTICLE
Penguindrum is one of my favorites, even though . . . . it's confusing as hell!  great music, touching stories about relationships, awesome art style and colors, and lots of weirdness.  Keep plugging along, I think you're not supposed to have a fucking clue what is going on yet . . . or ever!

Don't worry about it. After 24 episodes i still have no fucking clue

**Code Geass R1 (4-25/25)**  

Can't.. stop.. Watching..

Code Geass is a weird thing. The best way to describe it would be : "everything you've heard about it is probably true"  
A lot of asspulls ? Yes   
A lot of incoherencies ? Yes  
Epic twists of doom ? Yes  
Fucking entertaining ? Yes  

It's the kind of anime where you have to sit back, accept what happens, and just enjoy.   
Oh and fuck Nina and Suzaku.

PS: I absolutely love the 3rd opening. Too bad they only used it for 2 episodes, even more since I find the first one average and the second utter shit.  
**8/10**  


**Code Geass R2 (1-15/25)**  

I was thinking about taking a little break between the two seasons.. but I couldn't. Not with such a cliffhanger.
So it's a lot like the first season, but with more focus on mecha (which I don't like).

Seriously, it's like Bleach with mecha  
"My Robot is the strongest, I win"  
"No because I was hiding my new weapon, I win"  
"Actually, here is our new Robot that comes out of nowhere and is the best in the world, we win"  

But the very last episodes actually focus more on the story, so it's better.  

See you next week for last ten episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I just started Code Geass this week too! I felt like it started really strong in R1, kind of dropped off a little in the middle and then holy crap, those last 5 episodes of R1 were ridiculously entertaining. I'm at episode 16 of R2 right now and enjoying it even more than R1 because it kept the pace of the end of R1 and is even more over the top ridiculous. Damn this is such an addicting show.
>> ARTICLE
Whenever I get someone to start watching Code Geass I give them two warnings.  

1.  The gap between season 1 and season 2 does not make sense at first, you will say "what the fuck!?" for a solid 15 minutes before anything gets explained, dont worry you didnt miss any episodes or anything it all works out.  

2.  There will come a point in the series where you will hate every single character.  When you start watching you will be intruced to a new character and think to yourself "Surely not him/her, when you said I would hate everyone you did not mean them right?"  No.  No I was incuding that character too.  Just keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
Where were you when I started Code Geass? Going in with this mindset would probably have made for a better viewing experience.
>> ARTICLE
I find it funny that in some series I end up hating everyone, whereas in others like The 12 Kingdoms I originally hate all the characters and end up liking most of them by the end
>> ARTICLE
Finished Gurren Lagann this week. I wanted to shout "WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM" so many times this weekend. It was an entertaining and fun anime that I really started to appreciate after Episode 8. I liked seeing the little parallels in artwork with Kill La Kill. 
>> ARTICLE
Rewatched **Gunbuster (6/6)** with a friend. Loved it even more the second time around. Seriously, how can an anime from 1988 look and sound that good? It's absolutely amazing looking. Just love it overall, still a **10/10** in my book. Will be rewatching Diebuster soon along with picking up FLCL and possibly one of the Getter Robos. Which Getter Robo should I watch first?
>> ARTICLE
I happen to really like diebuster. It's much more modern though so expect to be thrown for a loop if you're expecting gunbuster 2. 

I overall liked it more. 
>> ARTICLE
Anno said Gunbuster was made with a low budget, which makes it even more amazing.  Though you can tell they saved a bit on ink in the last episode.

The movie Wings of Honneamise is high budget 80's Gainax. It looks gorgeous, though I'm not a big fan of the story.
>> ARTICLE
I just did this on Thursday too! I have a friend who's a huge Gundam fan and I thought I had to show him Gunbuster. We had a lot of fun joking about how 80's camp it can be but still thoroughly enjoyed it anyway. 

Also Ohta's aviators are legendary, dude wears them even when using binoculars. They reflect light sources that aren't even in front of him.
>> ARTICLE
I get put in a fit of laughter every time the little fucking twinkle appears on Coach's aviators. Absolutely amazing. Goddamnit I love Gunbuster. Did you show him Diebuster as well?  I think I like Gunbuster a little bit more but both are 10/10s for me.
>> ARTICLE
I like Gunbuster just a little more as well. We didn't have enough time to get to Diebuster but I can't seem to find Diebuster anywhere though. I can't even remember where or how I originally watched it. 

I'll try looking again now that I have someone to show it too. Hopefully I have better luck this time.

> how can an anime from 1988 look and sound that good?

Just because it's old doesn't mean it has to be worse-looking! [This is old, after all.](http://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/8783/animated-background_animation-black_and_white-bobb) And while I think we've seen a net gain, so to speak, in animation expertise over time, [some skills are being lost](http://i.imgur.com/NsqK47J.png).

On Getter Robo titles: [this primer may be useful](http://tsuzukusekai.wordpress.com/2010/02/23/the-getter-robo-ovas-a-primer/). That only covers the OVAs, but I'm not sure I'd recommend the original TV shows.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't mean the old thing in a bad way. I love older shows, I think they're much richer in animation techniques than the shows of today. Gainax especially have some very dynamic artstyles. I bet 90% of people would never guess Diebuster is from 2003, it looks better and is animated better than more than half of the anime today. And Gunbuster is just so expressive and detailed, I seriously can't get over it. 2 genuinely stunning shows in absolutely every aspect, as someone who is very interested in animation I've fallen in love with Gainax.

And thanks for the guide on Getter Robo, I'll most likely get started on it soon. Any other super robot shows you'd reccomend? I've heard GaoGaiGar is pretty good. Same with Mazinger Z.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, 2003's the end of the rocky patch after the shift away from cels, but watching Diebuster you'd never know it.

On super robot things. Yes, GaoGaiGar is pretty great -- probably the crowning glory of the Yuusha franchise. Its primary audience was children, so go in braced for that, and its first half or so is fairly episodic (though the combinations and attacks are awesome). Then it develops a serial narrative and the battles start getting bigger and madder and bigger and madder and it becomes dangerously good fun.

The original Mazinger Z is now available with proper English subtitles. It has lots of historical interest but is very long and really demands a lot of tolerance for episodic 70s children's anime storytelling. Don't feel like it's worthless but proceed with caution. Accessible modern reflexes of the franchise include: [Shin Mazinger Z](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5485/Shin_Mazinger_Shougeki!_Z-Hen), a from-scratch remake aimed at an older audience and directed by the awesome Yasuhiro Imagawa; [Mazinkaiser](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1064/Mazinkaiser), a well-animated epitome of the original series with more violence and fanservice ([and a sequel](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2734/Mazinkaiser:_Shitou!_Ankoku_Dai_Shogun)); and [Mazinkaiser SKL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8666/Mazinkaiser_SKL), which has little to do with Mazinger Z, but has very well-made action scenes and a kind of rough-cut, vicious charisma.

Other things... [G Gundam](http://myanimelist.net/anime/96/Mobile_Fighter_G_Gundam) is pretty fun and eventually strangely moving though again, like GaoGaiGar, it was primarily aimed at children with adults as a peripheral audience. It's a giant robot martial arts story, apparently influenced by lots of wuxia TV, and you don't need to have seen any other Gundam titles to watch it. Also on the topic of good fun super-robot-ish standalone Gundam titles, [Build Fighters](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19319/Gundam_Build_Fighters) is worth trying: it has a tremendous sense of fun, and loves its characters in a way not unlike Diebuster, though the stakes are much lower until the end (which is perhaps part of the joke). The battles are well-animated in 2D despite how modern the show is, too.

Since I've mentioned some other Imagawa titles I should put in a word for [Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2321/Giant_Robo_the_Animation:_Chikyuu_ga_Seishi_Suru_Hi), which has [consistently](http://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/9204/animated-artist_unknown-background_animation-giant) [fine](http://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/9201/animated-artist_unknown-effects-explosions-giant_r) animation and music and a bombastic, glorious plot about the Greatest Decisive Battle for the Fate of the World and also the different ways we react to the obligations our parents place on us. Also every character apart from the lead has supowerpowers or powerful martial arts skills, including the nameless goons on each side.

Finally -- and this is a slightly out-of-left-field recommendation -- [Nadesico](http://myanimelist.net/anime/218/Kidou_Senkan_Nadesico) is a silly-but-clever space opera pastiche. It's kind of a series of jokes about how we engage with fiction, and the ways that super robot anime fans can sometimes buy into potentially quite dangerous ideas.
>> ARTICLE
Woah, thanks for all the reccomendations :) Will definitely check them all out in time, I completely forgot about watching Gundam. I've heard Seed, Wing and 00 are the best but I'm not to sure. I enjoy Evangelion so it's not like I only enjoy super robot mecha, I need to try some real robot too.

Will probably watch GGG, G Gundam  and Shin Getter Robo vs. New Getter Robo first. Shin Mazinger Z looks interesting too. Thanks so much for the help! I can feel my wallet draining away, I spend a lot of money on mecha figures.
>> ARTICLE
I hang out in /r/Gundam a lot despite only having seen the first two Gundam titles and most people will say that you should probably start with the first titles as they are thought of as the best by many there. The original MSG(compilation trilogy of movies is substitutable for the series), followed by the Zeta Gundam series(Not trilogy), then ZZ Gundam, followed by Chars Counterattack to finish the main UC timeline. Then there are later series and a bunch of OVAs that take place in between the series that are in general supposed to be good. 

Most people over there say Wing is massively overhyped. Seed and 00 are reasonably well revered there for starter Gundams. But usually only for people who say they can't take older animation from what I can tell. I've only seen the compilation trilogy and Zeta so far and I can tell you that I absolutely loved them.

**[Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) (147-152/201)** - Includes my favorite episode so far, #150 where they were abruptly canceled and decided to show us the ending (and several alternate takes).

**[Angel Beats!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!) (1-4/13)** - I've had the OP burned into my memory from the best opening contest a few months ago, and I still really like it. And then episode 4 opens with a rock cover of it, nice.

Weird premise for a series, but I guess I've seen worse. On the surface, the mechanics of the world are remarkably similar to Log Horizon despite being a wildly different setting. Making the characters immortal allows for some fun deaths without being too serious.

I'm curious why Otonashi didn't talk to Angel early on beyond asking her to prove he can't die, but I guess that initially put them on poor terms.

After of the third episode I *suspected* I had an idea of where the series was headed. [Episode 3](/s "Iwasawa becoming content with her fate and disappearing as a result suggested that most of the other characters in the resistance would follow a similar path - they'd come to terms with their life/death and move on from limbo.") Of course the very next episode played around with the audience's expectations in that regard. Looking forward to more of it so far.
>> ARTICLE
Oh... the Angel Beats OP... Randomly listened to it a few months after I finished the show... Almost had to stop... The feels too stronk...
>> ARTICLE
I never really pay any attention to OP's or music in anime/shows in general, but My Soul, Your Beats! is one song I can never pass up. All of the music in Angel Beats! is really really good, but that OP will always have a special place in my heart.

About deaths being fun and not serious, wait till you get to ep 5/8. They each have 1 of my favorite comedy scenes in all of anime.

*****

**[Aria the Animation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/477/Aria_the_Animation) (1/13)**

*Recommended by: /u/masterofgo*

A melt-into-the-chair kind of show that Id like to keep on the back burner as a relaxant.

*****
**[Tales of Byston Well: Garzey's Wing](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1657/Byston_Well_Monogatari:_Garzey_no_Tsubasa) (1-3/3)**

*Recommended by: brother*

I was so befuddled after watching this show that I had to force myself to write in a more structured format in order to 1) claw my way back to sanity, and 2) tackle my viewing experience one facet at a time because the thought of approaching it any other way was unbearable.

**Story / Narrative**  After a quick spat with his girlfriend, Chris is abducted by a goose, granted the power of Garzeys Wing, and brought to Byston Well as a holy warrior to support the revolt of the Metomeus slaves against the Ashigaba army. He telepathically communicates with his physical self in the real world through a necklace, receiving both energy and technological insight that does not exist in the more ancient parallel world. This groundwork is laid over the course of maybe ninety seconds and surges forward relentlessly at the expense of cohesion, sense, and reason. Theres little to no pretext for anything that happens, the dialog only driving this lack of structure. I normally take notes on plot points, quotes, or reactions during watches, but gave up almost immediately this time around. You can argue that there is a sort of coming of age of the spiritual form of Chris, but whatever of that exists is engulfed by *everything* else.

**Audio / Music**  Based Central Park Media. The English dub is the vehicle through which most if not all enjoyment comes from in this show. Its as if the ADR Director had already put in his two weeks. Every VA shouts in a flat, monotone voice with the cadence of someone who does not have mastery of the language let alone a command over pacing and expression that I would expect of someone in the industry. There are instances where multiple takes have obviously been stitched together improperly over one line. The lines themselves are comically unnatural and disjointed from one another as if context and flow in conversation were deemed unnecessary. Sound effects and music were fine. My attention was drawn elsewhere to the point of distraction.

**Art / Animation**  Once again, Im not qualified to talk about direction, shot composition, etcetera. I will say, however, that there is constantly a high volume and density of objects moving on screen. While this helped keep interest, it made some action scenes incredibly hard to follow. Positions of characters change abruptly and nonsensically, sometimes popping into focus with no transition, sometimes awkwardly layered under animated pieces. I havent seen many shows of this age, but to my inexperienced eye the actual look of things is passable. Nothing too special to note.

**Verdict**  For all the playful beratement, theres a lot to enjoy in Garzeys Wing if you are a fan of bad movies, TV shows, and the like. Ill more than likely be doing a group watch in the future with a few willing friends.

**TL;DR** - basically The Room of anime.

**[Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo) - (9/25)**

After my favorite series, The Tatami Galaxy, was beaten out in the 2010 v 2012 competition I decided to see what all the fuss was about the series since it just seem like another Rom-Com.  So far I've been incredibly impressed, it manages to be hilarious and over the top but still feel serious when it needs to and the transitions between the two feel organic and not forced.  Additionally while the characters may be silly and over the top (especially Misaki-sempai), they still feel very relatable and human.  They have aspirations, goals, failures, and successes that are all very easy to relate to.

I came into this show wanting to watch a fun, entertaining Rom-Com and I got so much more, a wonderful blend of hilarious over the top comedy and personal drama in both relationships/love and pursuing ones dreams.  Initial impression: **8.5-9/10**
>> ARTICLE
I just finished this show myself. Man, having gone in with the expectations of just another feel-good rom-com, some of the shows themes in its character arcs hit close as hell to home, I had to legitimately stop and think about my life over and over. Definitely a nice show with a fitting ending imo. 
>> ARTICLE
I think this is one of those shows where I loved the entire supporting cast way more than the main character(s).
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Sakurasou myself, and I couldn't agree with you more. Seeing the characters' relationships develop as they came to terms with their emotions and learned to overcome them was really a great and emotional ride, with plenty . Usually in these types of shows everyone kinda takes a backseat to the protagonist but all of the residents were likable and seemed equally important. I decided to pick the show up on a whim and I'm glad I did! Easily a 9/10 overall. Now I'm just sad it's over :(
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait until your feel trip. Please keep us updated.

Yesss, another convert.

**Cowboy Bebop (1-11)**

I'm liking this show pretty well so far, although I find that the episodic nature of the series makes it hard to watch in large chunks. The characters are all fairly likable in their own right, even if they haven't really been developed much so far. For as much praise and acclaim as this show has received, I have yet to really buy into it, but that's probably because the best is yet to come. Hopefully next week I'll have more to say about it, since my thoughts so far can pretty much be summed up as good but not great.
>> ARTICLE
I totally get where you're coming from on that end, with is being tough to watch in chunks.

That being said, the last five-ish episodes of the show will change the way you look at anime. I wouldn't spoil the ending of the show for my worst enemy. You're seriously in for a good time, but take it at your own pace :)
>> ARTICLE
In the second half of the show, quite a bit happens, the characters are developed a bit more, and you learn about Betamax cassette tapes.  Personally, i think the second half is better than the first half, so i hope you stick with it and enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I have watched the first 12 eps in the last week and I am finding it so far just a really easy show to watch. Interesting characters in an interesting setting doing interesting things. 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't actually watch much last week since I had a lot of catching up to do (still do) and Halo and Dragon Age Inquisition came out recently.

**Spice and Wolf (S1 -> OVA -> S2 1-8)**

Absolutely *love* this show (all the above was in one day). Not looking forward to joining all of you "waiting for season 3" people though. :c

**Hanasaku Iroha (21-26)**

Finally got around to finishing this show (was watching it with my sister so I couldn't just binge watch it like I would otherwise). It was absolutely fantastic, one of the best examples of the SoL genre. Highly recommend.
>> ARTICLE
Hanasaku Iroha is damn good. The movie is still waiting for you, though.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Just waiting on my sister -.- again.
>> ARTICLE
> Not looking forward to joining all of you "waiting for season 3" people though.

As with everyone else that has joined the club, I recommend moving on to the light novels after you're done. The source material is just as good in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Probably what I'll end up doing once they're all out in English.
>> ARTICLE
Well I might as well say that I've had one of the best weeks when it comes to watching anime. I've finished 2 shows that both made me want to give them 10s, but containing myself to give them 9 instead. Also started watching 2 other shows as well where at least one show promise.

**Aria the Animation: 9/10.** This show easily won a place among my favorite anime so far. It's so different from anything I've watched until now with it's extremely chill pacing and relaxing nature. Aria is a show all about chilling. It's set in a futuristic utopia, where you follow the protagonist through her everyday life. There is no plot whatsoever, there is just pure Slice of Life entertainment. It's the first show I've watched that I've had to stop myself from bingewatching it, just in order to savor it. If you want to sit down and relax for 20 minutes or more I highly recommend Aria. It will help you calm down and find happiness in the small details of your everyday life.

**Golden Time: 9/10.** Golden Time is an awesome romance/drama show. That unlike most other shows doesn't take place in high school, but instead takes place in college. The show is also more about the relationship then your average high school romance, which is more about falling in love. If you liked shows like Clannad AS then I definitely think you should check this out.

**Baccano!:** I've loosely watched the 2 first episodes of Baccano! But I'm really disappointed so far. However since it's such a hyped show I'll force myself through the first 5 episodes atleast.

**Aldnoah.Zero:** I'm only on the 2nd episode right now, but it's showing promise, I generally don't watch much mecha, however I might just watch a bit more in this genre if it keeps being awesome. Especially since Baccano! was such a disappointment.
>> ARTICLE
I did not like baccano too much and this is coming from someone who loves Tarrentino, gangster movie, and anime like FMA:B (share some of the same things) but Id say you should still watch it and get your own opinion since the hype.

> **Baccano!:** I've loosely watched the 2 first episodes of Baccano! But I'm really disappointed so far. However since it's such a hyped show I'll force myself through the first 5 episodes atleast.

I didn't enjoy the first few episodes all that much either, but then something clicked for me and I ran through the last half in a day. That said, it's not for everyone.
>> ARTICLE
> **Baccano!:** I've loosely watched the 2 first episodes of Baccano! But I'm really disappointed so far.

Hint that may make it more enjoyable: although it skips between stories, each story itself is presented in chronological order.  So you won't have to worry about, say, a scene from the Flying Pussyfoot arc being shown before it's relevant.

The first episode was pretty bad though.
>> ARTICLE
I would definitely give Baccano! a few more episodes before give your final judgment. With multiple story lines running simultaneously, it takes awhile before the show makes sense. Also, the music was a big reason I loved the show.
>> ARTICLE
**Steins;Gate** (19/24)

I'm amazed at how dark Steins;Gate has gotten. The first 12 episodes or so are pretty light hearted, then BAM, things are getting super dark and depressing. At least the date episode was there to lighten the mood some!

**Yu Yu Hakusho** (35/112)

I've had this show on hold forever, I think it's high time I polish it off, or I never will. It's still brings me back to middle school, when I was an avid fan of the manga. This is my first time watching through the anime, and it's plain awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Yu Yu Hakusho is pretty good, though it goes downhill somewhat later on and becomes a more typical battle shonen series.  From what I've heard this was caused by the editors pressuring the writer.  

I suggest (if you haven't already) that you watch Hunter x Hunter, by the same author an it is an excellent series (starts off slowly though).  Its real problem is the nearly constant hiatus that the manga has had for the past 5+ years so the show ends prematurely (though the Ant arc is amazing).  I can only hope the manga will return soon for more than 5 weeks in a row. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it only goes downhill after the Dark tounament arc. But even then it's decent. Dark tournament arc is probably my favorite arc of any anime ever at least for shonen. Chimera ant is a fairly close contender though. 
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter episodes 1-29. To be honest I'm pretty undewhelmed. It's not *that* different from a regular shounen.
>> ARTICLE
I felt and still feel exactly the same way.

Stick with it though.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the beginning, but the way it was explained to me and the reason I started watching was that it becomes more mature as it goes on.  I can't remember the actual terms, but by the end it's really good (although a certain arc does drag on a bit too long in my opinion).

Still, I am glad I stuck with it.

I read your post lower down about your frustration with everyone becoming OP, but yeah that's solved pretty quick with regards to aura.
>> ARTICLE
I feel ya bro, 17 episodes in and it feels like sitting through a prostate exam. I'm sorry, if a show takes over 5 episodes to get "good", it's not "good" any more.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not gonna lie, it took me 3 tries to get into HxH. I could barely get past the first couple of episodes. And, one of most boring parts of the show for me was the episodes where they learn about their aura other aura related stuff (nen, ten, etc). But after that? Holy crap the show just ramps up and never seems to lose any of its steam. I can't really compare it to other shounen shows (since I haven't seen many of them) but I really, really enjoyed it. The Chimera Ant arc is one of the best things Ive seen in years. My only regret is that I had dismissed HxH as a kids show for so long.

I really hate having to say things like "keep watching bro it gets so much better", but I have yet to watch a show where this is more true than Hunter x Hunter. I think that the hype surrounding Hunter x Hunter hurts it in a big way, since it takes quite awhile to get to the moments where the show really starts to shine. People watch the first arc, it isn't as good as fans of the show have made the show seem to be, and they are disappointed, which is a completely understandable reaction.
>> ARTICLE
There are just quite a few things that piss me off. Gon and Killua are pretty much the chosen ones and can learn a new skill in 20 minutes, despite it taking most people 6 months, or that they can ruin a room full of trained, professional adults in a minute flat. Plus there's that aura shit, and there's no gravity in their universe either. Gon also needs to think a tiny bit more before he just tries to overcome everything by sheer willpower alone.
>> ARTICLE
Gon and Killua are by no means "the chosen ones" which you should notice either soon or have already. There are a lot more people that are as strong as them and even more that are stronger. Willpower will more or less be handled later on as well. I don't know what you mean by aura shit tbh. , was [Spoiler?](/s "nen") already introduced at that point? The point with the gravity makes more or less sense but considering how people can run insane lengths or are inhumanly fast makes it quite obvious that it is a universe where humans are capable of more than in ours, that's just something you have to accept, it's part of the world. Why Killua can do the things he can was mentioned already I think, or it will be soon. Gon and Killua both have immense talent, something that also exists in our world so it shouldn't be that hard to grasp. Of course it is exaggerated, but it fits both in a narrative sense and considering to what humans are capable of in that world. In addition to that Gon and Killua do an incredible amount of training. Both of that combined should explain most of your complains. At least the characters in Hunter x Hunter get stronger by actually training a ton and overcoming things which held them back, compared to other shonens. Willpower alone won't bring Gon anywhere, you will see soon enough.

The best part of Hunter x Hunter is undoubtedly the Chimera ant arc which might be one of the best things I have seen ever. So look forward to that. It's also the longest arc.

Hunter x Hunter is also really well written, which other shonens are not. That and far better characters make for an amazing story which honestly surpasses every other shonen there is and most other shows as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, [Spoiler](/s "Nen") has already been introduced.

Killua is understandable, but Gon is just some random island kid. Even if you do credit the ability to kick a grown mans ass at 10, and throw 400 pound guys across the room due to "natural talent", I don't quite like the idea that it gives off. It's basically saying that no matter how hard these other people worked (which they evidently did in the exam arc), they're always going to be beaten by somebody who was basically destined at birth to win.
>> ARTICLE
I am writing with my phone so behold the mistakes.

Gon is not just some random dude if you consider his father being one of the best there is. And it's not like those people won't be able to win. If they would trained a lot harder than Gon they probably could. That said, natural talent is something that might be unfair, but so is it in the real world. Some people can train however hard they want, thhere will be people who train less but are better. Just like inteligence partially depends on your parents or whether you are born in north korea or western countries, there are things you can do nothing about and that are simply unfair. But that is how the world is.

Also I canonly repeat, that there are people Gon and Killua will probably never be able to surpass, not even in a thousand episodes. This becomes a small theme later on as well but in other context and for a different purpose.

That said even if those things bother you, its undetstandable but not really a point to criticize the show, abd those things are there in other shonen as well, but in hunter x huntet it is actually handled pretty good and is even dealt with.

I am not sure if you see Gon shirtless in the exam arc but I can say for sure that he has a lot of muscles later on.

You compare the fictional world to much to ours. A fictional world is fictional for a reason. Your critic pretty much boils down to something like "its magic and that is unrealistic so its bad". The magic serves a purpose in terms of narrazive, at least in good shows.

It is mentioned later on that they have a talent of 1 in 10 million or something like that. The amount of effort, training and talent allow them to learn so fast.
 In the world they live in  talent seems to have a greater role than in ours, but training is still the most important part of getting stronger in the show, you will see them train a lot and extremely.

Back to the muscles, you also have to consider that not showing a ton of muscles is an artistical choice, partially having to do with relatedness. Its hard to feel for a character which has an inhuman amount of muscles. Especially when you consider the main demographic, although I am convinced that it is more of a seinen than a shonen. That muscles are lessnoticeable is a choice the creator made for a reason.

Like I said, I can understand if you dont like those choices, but that doesnt make the show worse.  I might be a bit biased though because I absoluetely hate it if people disregard fiction in general because its in the fantasy or scifi genre or because its an anime. Things like that dont say anything about how good or howmuch value it has.
>> ARTICLE
You could boil any show down to "it's fictional, so overlook it". Even if it is fictional, some things should be logical.
>> ARTICLE
There is a major difference between unlogical and unlogical in the world they live in. You shouldnt judge shows based on our world, but on their world and the purpose it serves for the narrative and other reasons. Its not an overlooked  flaw to begin with but a choice chosen for a reason which comes with benefits and merits. In the terms of the setting and narrative purpose its "logical" but I just noticed I hate the word used in this context. Logical in the meaning you use it is often worse for a shows goals.
>> ARTICLE
The major point that doesn't come across so well is that people with the skill to be Hunters are like gods compared to people who don't have the skill to be Hunters. 

You'll see Gon and Killua get the living shit kicked out of them later. Because even with the talent and training they go through, there's allies and enemies with more talent, and who have trained more.
>> ARTICLE
>At least the characters in Hunter x Hunter get stronger by actually training a ton and overcoming things which held them back, compared to other shonens. 

I'm not sure where you're getting this from, this is the main point of pretty much every shonen.


>Hunter x Hunter is also really well written, which other shonens are not.

What? You can't just decide that all other shonen have bad writing. HxH is certainly enjoyable, once you get through the first several arcs, but you're really making yourself sound like just another fanboy.
>> ARTICLE
The writing in it is definitely better than in all others that I know of. Also it's not like the first arcs are bad or anything like that, they are still amazing. I don't watch a lot of shonen and recently next to nothing, but from what I remembered most of it is power of friendship stuff and believing in yourself etc.

I might have expressed myself poorly, I didn't mean to say every shonen has bad writing. That would be generalisation. However, most shonen are written bad and few are written decently. I can't even come up with one that has good writing(besides hxh), although that may be because, like I former mentioned, I don't watch many. At least from my perspective. And for me, hunter x hunter was certainly far more than enjoyable, but I don't think that makes me a fanboy. If it does, I would be fine with it because I consider it one of the best anime and definitely the best shonen.
>> ARTICLE
You're in luck then, because a lot of these issues are solved fairly soon, especially the part about Gon using his head. Furthermore, pretty soon here the show introduces a bunch of adult characters that are much more realistic of what you can expect of someone who has much more fighting experience than Gon and Killua.
>> ARTICLE
HxH really starts off slow and slowly builds and builds and builds until you realize that Killua and Gon aren't the same boys anymore. Then you go back to season 1 and enjoy the nostalgia of when they had it so easy.

**Monster** 5-21

Oh my goodness this anime is so good. Single episodes are better than some entire anime. Every character is extremely interesting and well written. There are some characters that show up only for an episode or two and I find myself caring for them much more than I anticipated.

The mystery aspect is done really well. *Who really is Johan and what is his ultimate goal?* I'm trying to figure this out just as much as Tenma is. The slow pace of the episodes is great. It's very engaging and makes it hard to watch just one episode. Each episode serves a very distinct purpose, either giving more backstory to the interesting characters or continuing Tenma's quest to stop Johan.

Unless this anime screws up big time I'm going to find it hard to give it anything other than a 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished episode 21 also! What the heck. WE SHOULD BE PMING EACH OTHER ABOUT THIS AS WE WATCH AND DISCUSSING. I agree, this is one of the best anime I've ever seen in my life, it's weird that it's not talked about more.  You're absolutely right that single episodes are better than entire anime. Every character is unique and realistic and I love that. The mystery is perfectly done. I love the pacing of the episodes too, and its slow but never boring. 
>> ARTICLE
Hell yea, i'm currently on episode 35 and can't get enough!

It doesn't screw up. I found it extremely satisfying and it is one of my favorites to date.

The ending was a bit strange but not really a screw up.

I've watched lots and lots of OVAs!

I've decided to watch every single OVA and Special related to any show I've seen, AND at the same time I'm watching all of OVAs/Specials in my Plan to Watch list. Why? Because they're short, and because I can.

I'm writing down my thoughts on each OVA, so here are the shows I've seen this week. c: 

**Gokicha!! Cockroach Girl - *5/10***

This was average through and through. The story was fairly interesting, (idea wise) but due to the shortness of this OVA (16 mins) it didnt really *go* anywhere... Characters were likeable and cute, and had really cool character designs. That cockroach shell hair is pretty imaginative. 

Animation was shoddy, like really. Most of the time their mouths didnt even move when they spoke. 

Overall though I think it did what it set out to do - make me want to read the manga. Hopefully the manga is better and has more about the characters. And from what I can tell the manga has a much nicer art style. c:

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren Lite - *6/10***

Adorable and funny, much like the first half of season 2 of Chuunibyou. I was going to rate this a 5 because although it was good it was still same old, same old and they were only very short episodes however, the magical girl transformation scene in the last episode pushed it to a 6 for me. Oh and also - dat ED.

**Jigoku Youchien - *1/10***

Well this has been on my PtW list for ages and dear god, its **dire**. Its so bad. Theres no animation. Theres a total of 3 background images. The characters are boring and full of stereotypes, and their designs were extremely generic. Adding on to that, I didnt even like the art style. 

I forced myself to watch all 12 episodes, thinking Maybe something will make me laugh! Theyre only 2 mins long!

Nope. Nothing made me laugh.

Actually, scratch that - one thing made me laugh. The school seems to have Meth written on its roof. I *think* the fansubbers did that, though. 

Its one saving grace was the OP, it was quite cute.

This show looks like something a Tumblr user made for fun, in flash, in about a week. And even then, *I think the Tumblr user wouldve done better*. 

**Houkago no Pleiades - *5/10***
Enjoyable, but like everything so far on this list, it suffers from being just too short to do anything in. 

The characters got absolutely no developement, sure it was only 24 minutes long, but we learn nothing about our MC other than Shes slow - and thats only because her (annoying) friend says so.

I thought the antagonist was a girl for the whole 24 minutes until I looked up more information about this series and realised, nope, hes a dude. 

I really did like the art and animation in this though. The mahou shoujo designs were nice (and quite original imo), the uh, President (the squishy thing) was very cute and the scenes towards the end were beautiful and colourful. 

Worth watching if you have time to spare and if you like magical girls. The Subaru tie-in isnt *too* obvious, for what its worth. 

**Mizu no Kotoba - *7/10***

Heh, its funny, in my last mini review I said but like everything so far on this list, it suffers from being just too short to do anything in.

Mizu no Kotoba has just proved me wrong. Or at the very least, you can definitely do *something* with a short anime.

At just 9 minutes long, Mizu no Kotoba managed to successfully develop its main characters in the time it takes most shows to even *introduce* **one** character.

Each customer in that coffee shop had a very clear, distinct personality, so much so that you were aware of how theyd react to certain things... like you knew them already.

Im not QUITE sure what happened when the main character went into the back. I think it was supposed to show how [](/s "the robot") viewed people - like watching fish in a tank boring? Predictable? Honestly, I have no idea.

My one criticism of this show is actually two criticisms - the art style, and the voice acting.
Im not sure if I watched a bad version or something (I watched on Crunchyroll) but the voice acting seemed echo-y maybe that was *intentional* actually? Makes sense if it was.

The art style was atrocious, a couple of times the characters just looked terrible. 
I can look past that, fortunately, and as such I really enjoyed this. If youve got 9 minutes to spare, watch it!

**Megane na Kanojo - *6/10***

Aw, this was heartwarming. Each episode was about a different girl and how her glasses caused her to end up with a guy who loved her. 

I didnt enjoy the first two episodes as much as the last two. The third episode in particular was super cute, and probably my favourite.

Worth watching if you like cute romances and/or megane!

**Eve no Jikan (OVA) - *9/10***

Maaaan, I liked Mizu no Kotoba, so I figured Id like this I did! Its about 10x better than Mizu no Kotoba and its beautifully animated to boot (which Mizu no Kotoba was not.)

This show takes everything Mizu no Kotoba did and magnifies it to (almost) perfection. 

The director/writer Yasuhiro Yoshiura excels at what he clearly does best - character interaction and development. 

Each episode focuses on one or two characters in the cafe, yet with only 15 minutes per episode you grow to love EVERY character, and the amount of dialogue and story fit into each episode is almost absurd. 

The overarching story was interesting too, although I felt like I preferred the character focus more than I did the main story - and also, from the ending, it seemed like this was just the *start* of the story

I will also point out that this series unexpectedly did comedy *really* well - Episode 4 Nameless was hilarious at times.

I would definitely 100% recommend watching this. Im going to watch the movie next I think.

**Magical Star Kanon 100% - *7/10***

Not much to say about this other than it was very cute and enjoyable. I really love Kanon, and her songs are awesome.

**The World God Only Knows: Four People and an Idol - *5/10***

Enjoyable and fun. Im not a huge fan of Elsie (shes cute but there are better girls in this show) so this was a rather average episode for me. The brief K-on! parody on the TV was pretty funny, though.

**The World God Only Knows: Tenri Arc - *6/10***

Ehhh, again, Tenri - not my favourite character in TWGOK by a long shot. 

The story in this was a LOT more interesting though, we got to see how that [](/s "hole near the beach came about, how Tenri knew Keima, and how Diana came to be with her.") All things I was wondering about.

**Apologies for the extremely long post. ; u ;** I wanted somewhere to post my mini-reviews and I figured this might be the most appropriate place.
>> ARTICLE
The Gokicha manga is indefinitely better than the animations. It's my favorite 4 Koma manga, if that would do anything to convince you to read it.
>> ARTICLE
> Mizu no Kotoba  

> Megane na Kanojo

See, this is exactly why I love going through the weekly Y'all thread. I find so many interesting titles this way. I don't even need to ask for suggestions hardly at all because of posts exactly like this one. Consider both of these to be on my PTW List with high priorities.

Plus I'll say that Jigoku Youchien is officially bookmarked as well, and will be watched before this time next week. Why? Because I'm a masochist that *loves* subjecting himself to crappy anime.
>> ARTICLE
> Each episode focuses on one or two characters in the cafe, yet with only 15 minutes per episode you grow to love EVERY character, and the amount of dialogue and story fit into each episode is almost absurd.

Watching the movie version, this was probably my biggest surprise too. It was incredible to see how Eve no Jikan made me care more about some random person in a caf in 15 minutes than a majority of shows can make me care about the MC in 12 episodes. Despite being futuristic and somewhat detached from our lives today, it's still unmistakably intimate and human.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you liked Eve no Jikan!  

There's also the movie, which is amazing, I'm not sure how much it differs from the OVA but from what I heard it's the same story generally with a few scenes added (some important). So if you have some extra time I think it'd be worth at least skimming over, or watching later on.
>> ARTICLE
Time. How do you have so much of it?
>> ARTICLE
I don't, almost every episode here is under 15 mins long :P Total time spent watching was about 5 1/2 hours ^ ^ 

Edit: And almost two hours of that was Eve no Jikan c:

We can only hope. I'd say it was my favourite show of the spring season.

[**Dear Brother**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PemNeLhHvGQ) (on episode 9)

This show is so over the top, so dramatic, that there were times I laughed uncontrollably at scenes that the show intended the viewer to take very seriously. No really, Ive laughed at this anime more than most anime comedy. Yet I can't stop watching. It seems like everything that can go wrong for Nanako does go wrong. And, add onto that some very vile and horrible bullying. Granted I'm less than a quarter way through the series, but so far this show seems very promising. Though there seems to be way more nudity than I would have suspected for this very shoujo title. 

[**Spice and Wolf**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN_WgwEmRaw) (Season 1, ep 1-9)

I finally, FINALLY got around to watching this modern classic. Its pretty much living up to expectations, but I have to admit I had no idea the dub was this good. The VA's for Lawrence and Holo do an amazing job, and there are a lot of little nuances that they add with the line delivery that just enhances the over all experience. Been watching the blu ray release and everything lookds pretty damned good. Speaking of blu ray...

I just watched the blu ray release of [**Princess Mononoke**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OiMOHRDs14) this morning. My room mate and her friend had not seen (or heard of) it so I was glad I got to share in the experience. Being non anime fans, they liked it a lot, though they hated Lady Eboshi quite a bit. As for me, seeing Princess Mononoke on a big hd TV on blu ray was just stunning. I have probably seen the film 4 or 5 times before, but this time I did catch some small details I had missed before, like water ripples, forest detail, etc. One of my favorite Ghibli flicks, and it was great seeing in such clarity. 
>> ARTICLE
**Amagami SS (w/ SS+ and OVAs)**

I marathoned the shit out of this show. I was initially doubtful since the first and only omnibus show I watched before was Yosuga no Sora (which I didn't like very much). I love me some sappy romance. I enjoyed Sae's arc, but I feel like they could've chosen a different VA. Haruka is best girl, no arguments. Kaoru is on the same level, I guess. **8/10**

I'm about to get into Photokano since I really liked the omnibus format. Not expecting a lot though since it's gotten a lot of flack for being apparently bad.
>> ARTICLE
Darker than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha Gaiden (OVA): That first season was so satisfying, I was really looking forward to this. People have recommended the viewing be S1, OVA, Manga, then S2, so I'm sticking to that. It brought about the same intensity and character dialogue that I loved from S1. I was really sad with how it ended, (/s "was really hoping for Hei and Yin to end together, but I fully understand that this will be an ongoing plot point for S2.") In conclusion,  <3 Yin.


Highschool DxD (S1 and OVA): Alright, so even if a show has aired, I typically opt for either crunchyroll or a fansub as it had aired. This show is the first time I've DLed the Blueray of a show for wathcing (inadvertently), and all I can say is... this show has a LOT of nipple. Like, a ridiculous amount of nipple. 

I'm convinced that the entire show was basically just plot points and characters to bring about more nipple. Especially the OVAs, yeesh...

And I enjoyed every minute of it.

Yuru Yuri S2: This show... It just does slice of life right. Every episode ends and I have a huge smile plastered on my face. I'm keeping myself from watching the last 2 episodes so that I can convince myself that it's not over yet, until S3 inevitably comes out. It's hilarious, tons of likeable characters, and well worth watching for any fans of SOL.

Princess Tutu: The first half, I had no clue where this anime was going. Without glowing reviews from other people, I likely would have dropped it in its first cour. It was certainly a roller coaster, and once the ball really started to roll, I enjoyed it. The character of Duck is just such a well done character, and I kept rooting for her through all of the issues , and in Duck form, she is absolutely adorable. Great end to a great show.

Hunter X Hunter 2011 (1-38): Despite the glowing reviews and constant recommendation, I've been keeping myself from watching this one since I had watched the original anime from 2001.

Boy am I glad I changed my mind. The original was well done, but the visual improvements were noticeable immediately (10 years can certainly do that), and due to the source material, they have bene able to accelerate the pace of the plot, which I think was an improvement from the original. Will hope to finish up the show in the coming week.
>> ARTICLE
I also just finished Tutu. The storytelling is just superb, and I couldn't get enough of Duck, Lilie, Mr. Cat, and a few others. The "I will have you marry me!" gag never got old for me, nor did Lilie's sadistic pleasure in seeing Duck fail. The plot made me both fantastically happy and sad.

I also really loved some of the poignant quotes by Drosselmeyer, for example: "Happiness in stories is at most a trifling matter of a couple of lines at the end  the epitome of boredom. Now, show me a magnificent tragedy! A cataclysm of tears from which not one of the players is saved, and to which a happy ending never comes!"

[AnoHana Score (9/10)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai)
-----  
Man, what an anime!. The plot was really well developed, the characters felt real and you could tell how their relationships worked. The only bad thing is that at times it was a little predictable and some of the characters lacked more screen time.  
^^Shoutout ^^to ^^/u/Meoneone ^^that ^^finally ^^convinced ^^me ^^to ^^watch ^^it.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished this too! I gave it the same score as you did on my list of animes. I could relate really well to this anime because it has some things that I've experienced in life. (When I was little I had a small group of friends and we would make forts and stuff. Nothing tragic happened, we just grew apart).

edit: Do you know any other animes like this? I'm really set on watching sad animes. Just finished 5 cm/second before Anohana and now I'm watching True Tears.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know a thing about sad or feely anime, sorry. But I've heard that Clannad+S2 are a must watch so I plan to watch those and the AnoHana movie.
>> ARTICLE
Anohana. Marathoned it this weekend. Not that hard to do, but good lord my feelings are all messed up right now. I watched 5cm/ second before that, and the last 6 episodes of The World God Only Knows before that, so I'm just on a spree of sadness.

Oh, and I'm watching True tears now. I plan to watch Myself; yourself after that.

Might have to watch K-On! after this so I don't get too sad.
>> ARTICLE
Watched all of Hanayamata and A Certain Magical Index.

Index was really good although I kind of wish there was a little more of an underlying plot throughout. It seemed more just like a series of short stories that didn't really have much of an overall connection other than magic vs science. Good not great, looking forward to watching railgun next. 6/10

I loved Hanayamata. It was just so adorable and cute. And the opening was catchy and awesome. Just a great all around fun enjoyable show. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently watching Index (17/48) and agree that it feels kind of disjointed at times. I liked that the plot coincided with Railgun at points but still feel that it is rather weak in comparison and overall. 

Touma just seems kinda OP IMO.

I watched **Hunter x Hunter 116** yesterday.

Finished:

* Nyan Koi! - I feel like 90% of this anime could have been done without the annoying cat curse and cat talking. I didn't find it that funny, but it did have it's moments as well. Overall, girls were a bit bland and the show is forgettable.

* Mai-HIME - after over two months I've finally managed to finish it. The ending was shit.

Started:

* Gosick - Victorique is now my new favourite loli detective. I've only watched 4 episodes so far, but I think I'll enjoy this one. Oh, both OP and ED are lovely.  
  I feel like it's not mentioned a lot here.


>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love Gosick. At first I was like "Loli detectives? Is that really a thing?" and found out that it was, and it was glorious. The show is pretty much my favorite mystery work out there and the amount of closure in turn the main plot and subplot is beginning and other anime I've seen.

**White Album 2** - 11/13

I started this show about two weeks ago and the only reason I haven't finished it is that it has become painful to watch each episode.

 This show was SUPPOSED to be just a quick little romcom that to take up some time in between classes. It was NOT supposed to make me almost tear up in the middle of the student centre.

I will finish this show probably later today if the next episode doesn't rip my heart out. I am expecting it to though so it might take a few days. Loving it by the way.

**Yuru Yuri** - 3/12

I've been meaning to get to the second season of this show for way too long and after having to take a break from WA2 I decided I needed some emergency Moe. 

This show was adorable when I watched the first season and this one is the perfect amount of Diabetes to get my mind of WA2. This show is always fun.
>> ARTICLE
I will use the term emergency moe from now on thanks. Also I fwll you there after clannad :as I went straight to k-on!

Keep in mind white album 2 is just the first of three parts of the visual novel. It's not fully translated but if you search for it someone does a great summary of the routes for each of the girls so far. Very worth checking out. There's a whole lot of story left after the final episode. If you're interested I can post the link when I get home to my pc. 

I loved the anime but reading this story of the ending(s) made it much much more satisfying to me.

Is that so? I'll have to look into that. Sounds like I'm gonna want more closure after this.

[**Clannad: After Story \(1-12/24\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=4181)

Slow week this week, basically watched the "weaker" half of After Story. I have to say, the intensity really picks up after [spoilers](/s "everyone (minus nagisa) graduates"), and we start to see the characters struggle with life. I also like how they added backstories to everyone. My only complaint would be that [](/s "Tomoyo and the entire high school supporting cast are basically afk after grad, but I think its pretty much a given that they will show up again by the end. Edit: They literally showed up in the next episode"). So far I'd say its very slightly better than vanilla Clannad, but ofc im only judging half the series so far

Hahaha have fun with the rest of it this week.

**Nodame Cantabile**

So good. Such a lovely story... Learned about classical music, laughed a lot, and Nodame is really a charming character. Loved the dynamic she had with Chiaki and how fluid the story is.

Zetsuen no Tempest. Amazing show, 10/10. Had everything I would ever want in a show and more. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching Special A (originally aired April-Sept 2008). I don't normally watch romance anime, but so far (I'm on episode 12/24) I've really enjoyed this series.
>> ARTICLE
Watched a whole bunch of shorts. 

**Poulette no Isu, Cross Road, Furiko, Dareka no Manazashi, Mizu no Kotoba, Kick-Heart, Superflat Monogram**

For the most part, typically nice, but forgettable, with the exception of Cross Road. That was an ad, but man was it well done.

**Psycho-Pass 1-6** Finally decided to see what the hype was about. So far, it has not disappointed me.

**Gintama 19-22** As part of my routine to chip away at it. Still very episodic. I'm loving it, but are there any longer arcs later?

oh AND **Nisemonogatari 1-6** I really just want to find out what happens onwards at this point.
>> ARTICLE
> **Gintama 19-22** As part of my routine to chip away at it. Still very episodic. I'm loving it, but are there any longer arcs later?

I'm only ~150 episodes in but assuming the show doesn't change later, there are a few but they're scattered and not terribly lengthy; the longest I've seen is 8 episodes. The [weekly discussion spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MGJP6AiW8ler_qgLxdsf9OEIbqhJ49MzlBysr-UtU1Y/edit#gid=0) might give you an idea (contains episode and arc titles, but no real spoilers in those).
>> ARTICLE
Wow! I never knew that existed. Thanks for linking me to it!
>> ARTICLE
Well, if you ever get caught up feel free to join our ongoing threads. As of late it's mostly been /u/parameterized and I dumping walls of text on everyone.
>> ARTICLE
hahahahaha. implying i can catch up with ~120 episodes within a reasonable amount of time. It were manga, sure, I would be caught up by tuesday, but anime? nope.
>> ARTICLE
You have not even gotten to the good parts in Psycho-Pass

C'mon man, now I'm going to over-hype it for myself.

**[Aoki_Hagane_no_Arpeggio:_Ars_Nova](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18893/Aoki_Hagane_no_Arpeggio:_Ars_Nova) (13/13)** 

Had a day with nothing better to do, had been meaning to watch this for a while, and it was on Netflix, what else could I do but marathon it.

The plot itself was fairly entertaining starting with a good setting and being carried by the characters through a decent twist to a fairly unsatisfying Anime original ending, which will hopefully be continued in the movies (next year?) It diverges from the manga seriously and gives Kongou a vastly more central role as an antagonist, leaving the manga at the Haruna/Kirishima fight. 

All in all, the characters were a mixed bag, with all of the Mental models being both fleshed out and entertaining, but the crew of I-401 who get less development than the barely shown government side-characters. This is opposed to the manga where the crew get a decent shake of the stick and seem like people, not merely being talking components.

Visual character designs are extremely varied (they are consistent with the manga), and takes a different approach to the closest analogue Kantai collection, with each ship having a very different feel among the same class and lesser ships like destroyers not getting mental models making this process simple.

On visuals, I would like to say that this show makes me confident that CGI for the Kancolle anime may work out really well, with a majority of the animations being functional, and the only weirdness is when Hyuuga has her moments of excitement.

Music is OK if not my forte, with it fitting the situations well, the OP+ED are OK but I won't miss them.

Did I enjoy it? Yes, enough to read the Manga available.     
Would I watch sequels? Definitely.     
Would I rewatch it? Yes, maybe in the future.    
Would I recommend it? Yes, it is entertaining enough to give it a shot.    

P.S. I would let Kongou destroy me anytime...    
P.S.S. Can we have HMS Vampire animated pls...

Finished: 

[Gosick](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=8425)-Very fun and interesting to watch with loli detective and it has a good begninning and ending. 9/10 on MAL for me.

[Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=12189)- Was also very interesting, and had really nice art. It was entertaining to watch for me, but some of the drama seemed force at times, due to the overreaction of the characters at times. Kini narimasu. 8/10

[Usagi Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=10162)- Heartwarming to watch, and interesting as well. Very few complaints. 9/10

[NouCome]( http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=19221) Not bad, was funny at times,but I just didn't like it as much as the other things that I watched this week. 7/10 for me, couldn't justify the 8/10 compared to everything else that I give an 8 to. If there was a partial grading system, it would be more like a 7.6 out of 10. Somewhat underrated.

[Gin no Saji](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=16918) and [Gin no Saji 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=19363)-When I heard the premise of this anime, I thought there was no way that it would be interesting, as who wants to watch an anime about a high schooler going to a agricultural high school? It turns out however that I was wrong, and I thought it was amazing and fun to watch. 9/10

[Toaru Kagaku no Railgun](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=6213)- Overall, I would say that this felt pretty average as far as the animes I watch go. It was interesting and fun, but has more fanservice than I really want in an anime (I tend to like things with little to no fanservice), but I can manage.  Currently it is at an 8/10 for, or at least until I finish all of Index and Railgun S. 

Here is my [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/ub3rn00bz). If there is anything that is missing that you would suggest watching, please tell me, since I want more things to watch during my spare time.
>> ARTICLE
I would suggest giving Fate/Zero a try. the first episode might not make that much sense at first but its get clearer the farther you get into it.
>> ARTICLE
I've been wanting to get into the fate series, but I was wondering whether or not to do the VN first or just do TV series only, and have been putting it off. 
>> ARTICLE
well the way igot into the fate was watching the first 3 eps on studio deens version of F/SN then i waited till F/SN UBW started airing to get into it more then went through a little bit of the VN then lastly watched Fate/Zero.

It was a weird way to get into it, but once i got the grasp of what the fate series about, i could handle fate/zero without knowing all of fate/stay night. 
>> ARTICLE
If you want the quintessential fate experience, read the vn, then watch zero, and then watch the new ubw anime. If you can't make the time for the whole vn then just the fate route, ubw anime, hf feel movie later next yearish, should be great too if you want the best possible experience. If no time then ubw, hf, zero could be okay but not recommended.
>> ARTICLE
Started NGE because of how people on /a/ reacted to it a couple days ago. Just as a question, should I skip to EoE from episode 24 or should I watch 25 and 26 then go to EoE?
>> ARTICLE
Watch the episodes first, then death (true)^2 is optional, then go for EoE
>> ARTICLE
Watch the episodes first. That's the way people originally did it so there's no reason you shouldn't. 
>> ARTICLE
Kind of a short week for me this time around.

[**R.O.D. the OVA**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/208)

Oh yeah. I liked this one. A cute glasses girl as the MC? That alone is enough to pull me in to any given anime. And the fact that it was actually pretty damn fun to watch didn't hurt any at all. And Yomiko Readman has probably the most OP ability of them all: to make anything with paper. And not just origami cranes like we normally see in anime. 

Paper airplane? It flies over skyscrapers and seats two. 

Paper sword? Beats metal sword. 

Huge explosion about to happen? Throws up a gigantic shield made of paper. 

Her codename? Agent friggin' PAPER.

This is a worthy anime, and I'm going to catch the full series relatively soon. 

Score: 8/10  
Recommendation level: Read Or Die  

[**Freedom**](http://www.myanimelist.net/anime/1747)

I'm almost in shock. Here I went an entire week without watching a single anime that was shit. Because Freedom was far from shit.

Freedom was friggin' *awesome*. 

Take a story idea that is part Pale Cocoon and part Redline, plus mix in a small part of Space Brothers. Set it in a society that is part Psycho-Pass and part Akira. Get the director of Akira to do the storyboards and the character design. Drag in some amazing seiyuu and let them do their thing. 

And you get something awesome. 

It was just almost perfect. If it hadn't been for the exceptionally weak 4th episode, it would have been a masterpiece. Unfortunately, that was just too much of a downside to me to be able to make a twelfth perfect-10 on my List. Still beyond excellent, however.

Score: 9/10  
Recommendation level: Watch it. Now. No excuses. Now. 
>> ARTICLE
**Bakuman** (S1->S2-S3)

Woa, I really loved this show.  I initially started watching to kill some time between assignments, but ended up watching almost the whole first season in one go.  Finished the whole thing 2 days later.  Inspirational story; although not without flaws story-wise.  I gave it a 9/10 

**Shin Sekai Yori** (25/25)

I was very, very impressed with this one and I think I could talk about it for an hour or so, but here I'll just say I gave it a 10/10.

**The World God Only Knows**  (S1->S2->S3)

Watched this all in one go too.  It was pretty funny and I can see why people say this is one of the best (if not *the best*) harem shows out there.  I haven't seen a lot of them, so I don't know if I could comment.  I liked it! It was good, just the beginning of the third season gave me a little whiplash and I'm still hurting from it. Would have been a 10/10 if I got an ending, would have been a 9/10 if it kept up its story pacing but as it stands I'm giving this an 8/10, although I would recommend this show to anyone and everyone. Because it's worth it.

**Garden of Words** (Movie)

Woa, so pretty.  I didn't rate this because of the...circumstances I watched this under were less than good for reviewing a show.  But I saw it and remember it and I thought it was pretty friggin great.

**Tokyo Godfathers** (Movie)

Christmas Movie!! by Satoshi Kon!!  it was great.  Another one I could talk about for a while, but I won't here. I liked it and am currently hovering between a 9/10 and 10/10.

**Sakurasou no Pet no Kanojo** (16/24)

Aaand this is what I'm on currently.  I really like it so far.  We have over-the-top characters done right, struggles in life portrayed in ways where they *feel* like struggles and we have a romance plot that managed not to clue me into how it's going to play out so far.  The show is kind of oddly inspirational in a "I'm going out to achieve my dreams" sorta way and I managed to resonate with Jin on a pretty personal level.  Can't wait to see how it all plays out.

Woo, I had a week and with Thanksgiving coming up I'll so much **more** time for activities! 

Keep on keepin on guys and gals. See you next time.
>> ARTICLE
Pokemon: The Origin. I went in expecting something slightly better than the anime series, got so much more. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
**Steins;Gate (25/25) -** Definitely the best anime I have seen so far. 10/10
>> ARTICLE
You don't even have to give a reason for your enjoyment when it comes to S;G on this sub. Just say it's the best anime you've ever seen and wait for the circlejerk cum-drenched upvotes to come rolling in.
>> ARTICLE
> wait for the circlejerk cum-drenched upvotes to come rolling in.

DAE no one is allowed to have an opinion on this website except me XD le

please fuck off
>> ARTICLE
I think S;G is a good anime, but I find it funny how you can just say it's the best anime you've ever seen, give no reasoning and no one will bat an eyelid. You've got to be joking if you can't see any circlejerking of S;G on this sub. If you think I'm denying your opinion then you've missed the point.
>> ARTICLE
You don't need to "prove" that it's the best anime you've ever seen. It's been discussed extensively and there's no reason to repeat the discussion entirely for the sake of your personal enjoyment. As such, once again: i implore you to please fuck off. This website is not your personal circlejerk.
>> ARTICLE
Dude you're circlejerking harder than me right now. You're literally discouraging discussion as you're worried that someone might criticize your precious fucking S;G. 
>> ARTICLE
Is it not possible for people to have the same opinion?
>> ARTICLE
It's really a good show, but definitely nowhere near a masterpiece. I mean some of the dialogue is just too silly and otaku-pandering, the plot rips off The Time Machine in one significant area, and the animation is fairly average. People who think this is the epitome of anime just need to watch more anime.
>> ARTICLE
> People who think this is the epitome of anime just need to watch more anime.

Apart from classics, like Cowboy Bebop, or Legend of Galactic Heroes, what did you like better in the last few years?
>> ARTICLE
If we're just talking the past few years, Katanagatari, Ping Pong the Animation, Kill la Kill, Hunter x Hunter, Madoka Magica, Jojo, Shinsekai Yori, Attack on Titan... those would all be at least slightly more entertaining shows to me. One thing that elevates them is simply the animation; shows like these make use of everything animation can be about, fantastical worlds, impossible powers, stylized action... Steins;Gate didn't have that much to offer on this front.
>> ARTICLE
Oh Katanagatari.  I need to rewatch that show.
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori had wonky animation in parts but makes up for it in story.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with that.  I personally enjoyed SG more than SSY, but SSY was definitely a more intense story.
>> ARTICLE
But what Steins;Gate did offer was one of the best stories I have ever had the pleasure to experience.
>> ARTICLE
"But that's not my opinion and if your opinion is not my opinion you're a circlejerking faggot"

>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari -  i just finished 7th episode, it's great

Samurai Flamenco - i just started that series so no opinion for now

Yahari Ore ... - rewatched this in anticipation of second season


>> ARTICLE
Both Katanagatari and Flamenco are in my top 20... out of over 100 or so (does include incompletes though).  Definitely worth watching, but for Flamenco you need to know some history about Japanese hero shows (Kamen Rider and such) to fully appreciate it.
>> ARTICLE
I finished Hyouka yesterday and was pretty glad that I put it at the top of my list. Also read some old analyses of it on /r/anime which added to my experience of the last few episodes a fair amount. It was definitely worthwhile, and is now one of my recent favorites.
>> ARTICLE
K-ON! Finally decided to give it a chance so far so good. 
>> ARTICLE
**Hellsing Ultimate  (3/10)**

After watching Arkada's review I got interested in it. I don't usually watch shows dubbed but considering its setting I figured having the characters speak English would be much more appropriate.  

The humor's a bit hit or miss but really it's the action we came to see here. In regards to a pure action show I would definitely put this second only to Black Lagoon but that's mostly because I feel Black Lagoon had better characters.

**Valkyria Chronicles (1/26)**

I saw my friend play this game and it looked like so much fun, but I do not have a PS3 anymore. The only one available on a console I do have with me is the second one on the Vita. So I looked it up and there's an anime of it. Wanting to get the gist of the story of the first game I figured it was good enough.  

The first episode was really good. The world felt incredible and I am completely interested in what ways the show can develop. The characters felt a bit clich but we'll see how they develop.  

I've actually been looking for military shows with this setting. The WW2 era. Not far future, not fantasy, not near future. The closest thing I've gotten so far is Sora no Woto. Man that show was good.
>> ARTICLE
Valkyria Chronicles actually has a PC version now, if you would be interested in that!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know, but in a week I'll be heading off to the backwoods with no access to the internet and steam for a couple of months. I figured I'll rush through the anime and play it on my vita while I'm there
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's cool! Have a nice trip, dude.

yeah thanks

Started Chihayafuru on monday, I'm about to finish it today. I'm a sucker for sports anime, and this is a sports anime through and through, only with an unnusual sport. 

I'm half way through Spice and Wolf 2 as well.

Finished:

**Jinsei**

Just finished on Tuesday. Im usually not into Slice of Life anime but watching this made me want to watch some more.The characters I did like (I didnt like Fumi as much as the others, I just dont like characters who talk about Feudal Japan all that much). Overall, it was pretty funny and some of the life advice the girls give is hilarious. [Also...HNGGG](https://38.media.tumblr.com/40233d4be3cbc03a02c2858b6b76bd59/tumblr_n8s4764S4m1t01xvho1_500.gif)

Finished- Kiniro Mosaic 

Dang, I was perfectly healthy before, but now I've got terminal diabetes from the sweetness! All the girls were cute and funny, but Karen is def best girl. Her broken Japanese was the moest of moe. I thought all the characters were great, and the jokes never fell flat. 80/80 m80s

One Piece, its been 2 days and i havent been able to watch any of my currently airing shows just because i want to watch one piece. :(

I smashed through the entire monogatari run. Had tons of fun and am rewatching it. I am really enjoying the conversations again even though I thought I would be bored through them. Also a second chance to really take in the backgrounds and other details you might miss trying to keep up with the talking. 

I could watch the kizumonogatari flashbacks all day. 

Also, class rep. ^^^neko ^^^tongue ^^^twister

**Hunter x Hunter 1999 and Hunter x Hunter Spider OVA**  
I don't know why, but I feel like I enjoyed the Yorknew arc in 1999 more than the 2011. also that Hisoka pelvic thrust.

Yorknew '99 was dark as fuck. I, too, prefer it over 2011 Yorknew despite that I slightly prefer 2011 over '99 as a whole.

I've been watching NANA. Gotta say that it's an amazing romance with a fantastic soundtrack. 
>> ARTICLE
**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!** (ep1-end)  
Really beautiful romcom drama from KyoAni. I liked how the comedy in here had influence on the overall story (compared to Haikyuu!! where I really disliked the use of comedic elements).
Some really nice visual setpieces throughout the show. Soundtrack was fitting, but nothing really stood out except maybe the OP.
Was really easy binge material (it being short favoured this a lot) and overall a great watch (Rating: 8,5/10. 9 on MAL)
>> ARTICLE
The World God only know Season 1 Episode 7.

I have to say I did not expect this. I Expected some mindfucks/mindplays since I thought the Mc is God. But I realised he is just some Romeo. Great Anime so far

[Clannad After Story](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad:_After_Story) **(24/24)**

[Needless](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6030/Needless) **(24/24)**

Holy shit this show sucked balls. I have no idea why I watched all of it. The comedy was ok but there were so many plot holes.

I've been watching ef: A Tale of Memories.  It's not BAD, but Jesus Christ could it possibly be slower?

Rewatching Code Geass because I got my little brother into it.

Watched Clannad and am about halfway through After Story.

Watched an episode or two of Fate/Stay Night and A Certain Magical Index.

I'm not ready for Geass R2 and After Story though...

**Hidamari Sketch** All of season 1

I hadn't watched a slice of life/cute girls in a long time, because I thought I was done with them. I had tried watching Yuyushki a few months ago but it got old fast. Hidamari was very refreshing. I actually watched the first episode of the second season thinking that it was the first, which strangely works because it is chronologically the first. 

My reaction to that episode was wonderful, really loved that Shinbou directing. That's really what separates this show from other cute girl shows for me. The whole time I was just grinning at all the SHAFTness, and the fantastic character designs by Umi-sensei. 

There was a little less of that in the first season than in that first episode of season 2 however, but that just makes me all the more excited for the remaining three seasons. Season 1 did have some nice SHAFT moments, like the [real-ass Brutus.](http://imgur.com/zUP8aER)

Overall I guess I feel like this is K-on with better directing, art and characters maybe. I'm loving it. 

So now I wanna watch more Shaft stuff. I've only seen Madoka, Nisekoi and the Monogatari Series. I do have Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko next on my list but feel free to give me a recommendation. 
>> ARTICLE
I finished Nazo no Kanojo X yesterday. I really liked it. Anyone got any suggestions for anime similar to this?

[B gata H Kei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7817/B_Gata_H_Kei) perhaps?
The premise sounds like a porno but it's actually a rather funny romance story.
>> ARTICLE
[Suzuka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/390/Suzuka), I'm about halfway through the series and despite no expectations going into it I'm really enjoying it! it gives me massive nostalgia for when I was like 15 and in high school, the MC has like...some of the exact same thought processes I used to have. I actually like the characters decently well too. Good soundtrack as well. I only even watched the show because I made a drunken agreement during the summer with my friend that we were gonna watch all the shows each other had watched (still going strong, must be about 6 or 7 series in by now)
>> ARTICLE
Free Eternal Summer.  It's in a slump right now (as is Haruka) and is a little boring, so I'm trying to get through it and am confident it will turn around and be good again soon.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Senki Zesshou Symphogear a couple days ago. Shit was great. Its a great magical girl show, my only problem being Miku's crying and the late introduction of the third member of the team. Villan was great(if a bit weird) but overall was pretty standard mahou shojo stuff with a great twist on the formula.
>> ARTICLE
Only recently got into anime, but I watched The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. It was a long movie but the pacing and score are great. Definitely one my favorite movies so far.

I'm currently watching [Chihayafuru]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/10800/Chihayafuru).

I'm having a blast! I've been looking for a sports anime after watching [Baby Steps]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/21185/Baby_Steps), [Haikyuu!!]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu!!), and [Kuroko no Basuke]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/11771/Kuroko_no_Basket) . Chihayafuru is really different because it feels so geared towards the josei demographic, but it's really beautiful and still delivers the sports anime elements. 

Edit: added links

**Yozakura Quartet: Hana no Uta (13/13)/ Hoshi no Umi (3/3)**

The fights in this series are great. They are well-animated, chaotic, and embrace the 'Go Big or Go Home' philosophy. The series is worth watching just for them. Unfortunately, everything else is pretty mediocre.
>> ARTICLE
**Ergo Proxy (16/23)**

This show is a bit weird for me. There are episodes where I have no clue what's going on, but I still enjoy it. All the characters are enjoyable to watch and I think that is what makes the show, even when the plot goes nowhere. My favorite episode so far would have to be [Episode 16](/s "when they got stuck on their ship with their limited supplies and it was shown through Re-l's perspective. I think it was able to really capture the hopelessness of the situation.")

Finished Aria: The Animation and started Aria: The Natural.

I'm finally getting around to watching Monster (eps 1-13) and it's addictive. I can't stop watching it!

**.hack//Sign (17/26)**

Not much to say about it, it's interesting but slow, not a lot going on. Thinking of dropping it. 5.5/10


**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (12/12)**

Holy shit this was amazing. I absolutely loved watching this, it was fantastic. After watching, I started reading it, so I look forward to that too. I absolutely recommend watching this. 9/10

**Gatchaman Crowds (3/12)**

Seems good, but I haven't really watched enough to know what i think about it. Looking forward to finishing it though

**Yuru Yuri and Yuru Yuri (24/24)**

Easily among my top anime. It was so much fun to watch, all the characters were great, it was hilarious, an absolute must watch in my book. 9.5/10

Note: Not all these episodes were in the past week, some I just finished this week, but started earlier
>> ARTICLE
You made it farther in .hack then I did. I love the music so much but I just couldn't take the boredom. It's a 3/10 for me just because of the music-that is to say it's a 1 without it. 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't get to watch much anime this past week, but what I did

**Ghost in the Shell 2.0** - And, so, the Ghost in the Shell marathon begins. Decided to watch this after picking up the GitS: Arise Borders 1 & 2 Blu-Ray set. Gonna re-watch Stand Alone Complex and 2nd Gig starting this week

**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (1/12)** - The first episode was on Time Warner's Anime Network on Demand. Therefore, I had to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
**Spice and Wolf** (5-13/13) after not watching it for a while. I'm digging it. That's all I've really been watching this week, though. Probably going to continue with the other series on my list next week, probably **Aria the Animation** and **Usagi Drop** as well as picking up **Evangelion** after a while, then continuing onto **Spice and Wolf II** ~~later in the week~~ RIGHT NOW.

Speaking of this week, anyone got any Thanksgiving-y anime to watch?
>> ARTICLE
Kotoura-Chan. I missed this one last year for some reason. So far (episode 5) it has been fun to watch. It made me really depressed at the beginning, but has proven to be a great show.
>> ARTICLE
**Kyousougiga (episodes 1-8)**

I have some kind of idea what was happening, but man, Koto's fun. [Also](/s "threatening the safety and security of 12 other dimensions to heal her mother") makes her really ballsy or really stupid. I think it's a combination of both.

**Inferno Cop (completed)**

"I'M IMMUNE TO YOUR BULLETS!"  
"SO AM I."  
"NANIIIIII?!" *dies*  
It's so stupid, I love it.

**The IDOLM@STER (episode 11)**

I feel kind of bad for Miki. And Yukio is kind of annoying, but I'm glad she was able to dance successfully.

**K-ON!! (episode 1-3)**

Second season of K-on, second time watching it. It was adorable as fuck, more so than the first time.

**Highschool of the Dead (episodes 1-3)**

Back to where I started with anime. It's pretty odd to go back and see the characters, but recognize their seiyuus' as other characters. Saeko, for example. I now recognize her as Kurapika/Kanbaru instead of Saeko. And Hirano as Sanageyama from KLK.

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. I'm think in the middle of watching the last episode of the Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
I dont think I binge on shows as much as some of you guys here so I am going to include the last month or so.  

**Sword Art Online Season 1**.  throughout my time in Anime I have gotten ever more sick of the standard Shonnen character.  Speaches about friendship, magic willpower to conquer all, saving the world single-handedly despite an overgrowing roster of support cast,  endless reserves of whatever the mana muggifin is for that world.  I am sick of the Ichigos, Natsus, and Luffys.  

And yet I find I can watch SAO.  Its still hopelessly Shonnen in many ways but it puts a real effort into at least attempting a plot and characters.  I plan to start season 2 soon.  

**K-ON**  With less and less time to devote to Anime in my life I find myself using AMVs to get my fix.  Some of the youtubers I watch I noticed were using footage often from this cutesy little show called K-on.  It was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS1R3nUHsI&list=LLRKL2aayWoSgDFoMFyaSOaQ&index=16) AMV that made me finally think, eh I'll check it out see what its all about.  Its not my normal show by any means but why the hell not expand.  It was only 12 episodes or so, so I started it up.  It was the dummest cutesiest thing I have ever laid eyes on... one week later I am up to episode 18 of season 2.  help me.

**ROD The TV** (Rewatch, 20/26, Dub): Great story, great characters, great-at-making-themselves-as-unworthy-of-sympathy-as-possible villains. Episode 20 summed up in two words: "poor Anita". For anyone looking to watch the show, start with the OVA, and [beware episode 9](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode "it's telling when it's the scene I most vividly remembered, and also why I didn't rewatch the show more. Even knowing it's coming, it still hits hard"). Also, when an episode is named Farenheit 451, you should already know what to expect.

**5 Centimeters Per Second (6/3)**

Watched it twice, in the last week. It was amazing both times. Looks so good. Sounds so good. What I got out of it was so good. Guess if I were to have one complaint, it would be that it is very slow.

**9/10**

**Haibane Renmei (10/13)**

Going to finish it today. It is so good. So different, but in a good way. Didn't expect any less from the guy who did Serial Experiments Lain. This show mindfucks you in its own way. So far, I have nothing bad to say about it. I was also recommended to watch the dub on this one,and I have to say, the dub is surprisingly good.

**10/10**

As of late, Jigoku Shoujo. That's some pretty messed up stuff. Only thing that would make it better was if Jigoku Shoujo took all of the characters from School Days into Hell.

I marathoned Fate/Kaleid Liner PRISMA ILLYA.

[Shinsekai yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125). Great series.  One of the most story driven anime I have watched.  The setting was a little unrelatable due to how far in the future it is set but they spend a fuck ton of time world building and getting you up to speed.   The part that stuck with me the most was [](/s "Maria sacrificing her love of Saki to protect Mamoru.  He loved her with all his being even though her heart belonged with Saki.  Nevertheless she decided to stay with him because he needed someone to protect him.  Learning later that they died was pretty devastating to me.")

The only spotty things was the animation was sometimes a bit wonky.   Also I didn't much care for the queerats.  They were kind of lame.
 
9/10

Yozakura Quartet (All 3 of them, with Tsuki ni Naku last) 

I really enjoy the setting, which is a modern fantasy. It's got cars and broomsticks, oni and police officers, half daemons and people, science and magic. It's a wonderful, vibrant setting that is an excellent backdrop to the story. 

The story itself is not exceptionally good but its certainly not bad by any means. It takes on an *almost* episodic nature except each episode is tied to the one before it although each one could be construed as its own arc (with a few exceptions). The group of characters try to defend their city of Sakura Newtown from forces that would try to merge the human world with the demon one while at the same time trying to live up to their parent's (who have disappeared) legacy. 

The characters are all interesting and likable. They're all different enough to keep things fresh and relatable enough because they are teens. 

The animation is wonderful, fight scenes are excellently choreographed. 

It's 19 episodes including Tsuki ni Naku, which is a sidestory. 

Kotoha best girl.

I watched [Elfen Lied](http://myanimelist.net/anime/226/Elfen_Lied) for the first time and it was actually very enjoyable. Some of the antagonists came off as generic evil badguys and there were a few cliche parts but overall I really liked how it explored the characters pasts and what led each character to make the decisions that they did. Was a very good short anime and it felt different from pretty much every other anime I've seen before, which is pretty cool for a show that is over 10 years old.

The manga is fairly good if you are curious about the real ending/ what the actual fuck happened in the anime ending.

Toradora (11/26?) I recently started watching this in anticipation of the annual rewatch and I heard the dub was good so I decided to givw it a try.  I'm stuck on my lwast faverite arc this and and the ryujis best friend arc are my least faveorite of this show. I don't know why but I really enjoy the dubbed version of this which is rare I usually hate dubs. Of course I still prefer the subbed over dubbed this one was handled very well. I still feel somethings are lost in translation and we don't get taigas Baka that some of us treally find amusing.All I can say is that I'm ready for the rewatch and looking foward to it.

Watched all of Ga Rei: Zero. Liked it a lot but it was flawed with comedy and some plot hole issues. 8/10

Watching Higurashi Season 1 with some friends a few days a week over skype. Gotta say I absolutely hate it. I can't see it getting anything over a 5 unless it gets a lot better.

Start TTGL today. 2 Episodes in so far so I can't make many impressions. A bit boring though.

**Magical Girl Madoka Magica (10/10)**

I...I had avoided this series out of the hype train that had been following it.  Honestly, I had not desire or interest in watching it, because of all the people telling me it was fantastic.  It's a weird feeling, I guess it would be hype overload or something.

As I sit here not minutes after finishing the 12th episode.  My tears are leaking from my eyeholes in joy and sadness.  That was one of the most interesting and different rides I have been on through a story that I can remember.  I kind feel like how I felt after watching the Original EVA for the first time.  Dumbfounded, desiring more, and satisfied all at the same time.  It's a strange feeling, but also one that I haven't felt in awhile.  I feel stupid for having avoided a series like this.  

**Carnival Phantasm (7/10)**

I got it to watch when I figured the boredom with Madoka would set it.  Now I'm just watching it to kind of deal with finishing Madoka.  It's funny and random.  Makes you laugh.  That is all.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It's good. I don't want to make any judgments about the series as a whole as I'm only 15 episodes in, but as of now, it's overrated - the series has a lot of good points and some bad points as well, and so far it's been bombastic and engaging but not the masterpiece it's made out to be. But hopefully it gets even better.

Hunter x Hunter, I've never had the chance to watch it even if everyone around me was telling me about how good it is. Now I can't stop watching, 30+ eps in one week. *Schwing*

**[Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann) (27/27)**  
9/10. This show made me feel like a kid again with the action and the shounen feel, but at the same time it appealed to the side of me that has grown to love the feels. Some parts of this show really took me by surprise and I enjoyed that a lot about it. I'd absolutely recommend this one if for some reason you haven't seen it yet like me just a few days ago.

**[Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14813/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru.) (13/13)**  
7/10. [Yukinoshita](https://i.imgur.com/0OtGYSs.gif) is really rad, I'm looking forward to season 2 of this!

**[No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life) (12/12)**  
7.5/10. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, I understand the hype. Looking forward to more episodes!

Serial Experiments Lain. In all honesty I find it incredibly slow and not that interesting, though I adore ABe's designs. I'm only three episodes in though so maybe I will come around. As a side note, this series looks fantastic in HD.

Zankyou No Terror (1-11/11). That was a nice show with cool characters I could sympathize with. The English spoken's a little cringeworthy, though.

I'm in the middle of binge watching **Isshuukan Friends**. It's a simple, very heartwarming slice of life show that will make you smile like an idiot the whole time. My only complaint is about how incredibly beta the male MC is. It's so annoying watching a teenage boy lose his mind and freak out whenever there is the slightest reference of a possible relationship forming between himself and the girl he likes. 

She invited you to her house to study, your natural reaction should not be to start screaming. It's such an overused, cliche trope.

Other than that I'm loving this show though, gonna finish it tonight. Kaori is an angel.

I'm still watching Hunter X Hunter after people recommended it to me so many times (got to episode 80).

**Shinsekai Yori (25/25)**

After a pretty slow build up for quite a long time delivered an incredible ending. If the whole show was as good as the like 8~ episodes it probably would have been a 10/10 for me but I'm going to give it 7/10 because it took so long to build up. Definitely worth it though, if you're thinking about dropping it, don't, it's worth it in the end.
>> ARTICLE
[Nabari no ou](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/nabari-no-ou) followed by [Lovely Complex](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/lovely-complex).

Nabari no ou had really cool animations for the fight scenes though I felt the story could have been a bit stronger.

I'm half way through Lovely Complex at the moment and am enjoying it. I especially like that the main characters aren't mortified to speak about their feelings the way these schoolyard slice of lifes generally go.

That's about it. I watch a lot of anime but am not much of a reviewer/critiquer and am sure I could be told I have terrible taste :)
>> ARTICLE
**[Key the Metal Idol](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1457/Key_the_Metal_Idol)**. I'm slowly burning my way through this 15-part OVA from 1994, but as much as I'm enjoying it, it's hard work. The plot is unfolding *very* slowly so far, and there are still a lot of unanswered questions about who everyone is and what they're after.

I'm pretty sure it's good, though. I'm expecting things to click together very quickly once it gives me more pieces to work with, and a rewatch will almost certainly be rewarding.

**Monster 1-22**

WHY IS THIS NOT TALKED ABOUT MORE? I don't ever see it mentioned on r/anime. This is seriously one of the best things I've ever seen. Maybe it's because it has 0 anime tropes. Maybe its because it feels -- unlike most anime -- that it could very well  be a traditional TV drama. I don't know, but the storytelling is some of the best I've seen. It is what I would call "True Drama". The drama is perfect. The conflict is perfect. The art and portrayal of characters is, though a friend doesn't like it, I think perfect for what it is. The characters are depicted realistically -- often ugly or crooked. Which really is what the shows about. The world being very ugly and crooked. A show about darkness. A show about the struggle against darkness. I think that the show very well may be conceived from the Nietzche quote "Fight not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you".

COULD NOT RECOMMEND MORE.

**No Game No Life** - Finished

Extremely entertaining. Strange mix of Code Geass, Death Note and echci comedy. Loved it!

**Clannad** - Still watching

This show gets so much praise I had to try it out )well, the second season does). I'm in 6th episode I think and so far not bad. Some really good jokes from time to time but otherwise, I have absolutely no idea what's going on.

**Zankyou no Terror** - Still watching

Apart from [ZnT Spoiler](/s "Five"), great story and possibly one of the most realistic looking and beautiful art I've seen in anime. 

**Jinsei** - Finished

Why did I watch this? I mean, I finished it. I had a good laugh few times. But I still feel like it was just a huge waste of time.

I finally dug up the time to watch TTGL and marathoned the first 9 episodes yesterday, planning to watch a few more today. It's unfortunate that the events of episode 8 where spoiled for me, but the show is as badass as I was expecting. I can definately see why it gets so much praise as a fun show.

Yoko also surprised me a lot. I really wasn't expecting her to be as likable,  but she's easily my favorite character so far.
>> ARTICLE
Watched through an old favourite of mine: **Nodame Cantabile**  
It's always been a great anime, especially now with **Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso** airing aswell.  
It made me find my clarinet & start playing classical music again, which i'm very happy playing at the same time as my guitar & a more "metal" kind of music.  
I used to play my clarinet while i was in middle school, but completely stopped entering high school cause i thought it was "lame", but in later years i realized it doesn't matter as long as i play what i like.
>> ARTICLE
**Last Exile 21-26** [Finished] - Man this was a fun ride. I did get tired of it, which lead to me putting it on hold for a while, but when I finally picked it back up I regretted putting it on hold. It does have it's fair share of issues, like getting sidetracked into becoming a terrible misunderstanding-romance series for a few episodes, but for the most part it held up really well with some effects that despite being dated are still pretty good even for today. *8/10*

**Garden of Words** [Completed] - I'm working my way through all of Makoto Shinkai's works as I plan on doing a special video review series reviewing everything he's done. So far (I have yet to see the place promised in our early days and children who chase lost voices) it's my least favorite. The animation is easily the best so far, but the story and characters are pretty mediocre. It's an easy watch, I'll give it that, but if not for the animation I wouldn't recommend it. That said, the animation is so good that I *would* recommend it if only just to witness 45 minutes of beauty, which is uncommon for me. *7/10*

**Space Brothers 26-30** [Watching] - Space Brothers continues to be great. Honestly I've never seen a show that's held up so well even after 30 episodes. The pacing is just brilliant.

**White Album 2 episode 2** [Watching] - I'm having a hard time working my way through this one. I was recommended it based on my favorite shows, but honestly it's not really pulling me in. It's decent so far, but nothing about it stands out to me and some of these dramatic moments are downright ridiculous.

**Aria: The Animation 7-8** [Watching] - It's hard to watch too much of this show at one time. Even in one sitting I can't make myself watch more than one episode. It's just so relaxing that I can't help but watch it before bed, and then one episode is all I need.

Half way through Shin Sekai Yori (finished ep.13)

One Outs. Just started it today so I don't really know where it's going yet, but it's got potential.

Two days ago I finished Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. I wasn't really into it for the first couple episodes, but the characters really started to grow on me after awhile and I'll admit I teared up a little at the end.

And a few days prior to that I finished Terror in Resonance. It was ok. I feel like the best part was the beginning few episodes with the riddles between Nine and Shibazaki. Sadly the whole thing felt overly compressed down to 11 episodes. If it'd gotten a full 26-ish episode run they could have developed the characters a bit better and played up that angle more before Five got involved and the show started going downhill.

Durarara! and Haruhi and rewatches Sakurasou and Aldnoah.Zero

Zankyou no terror - absolutely loved it, it might not be perfect but its definitely great.Elfen Lied. I was disappointed. Characters are blank, plot is boring and predictable.

OreImo. Just finished it this weekend and I really enjoyed it. Kirino (one of the MCs) is really relatable if you watch a lot of anime.

I really recommend it if you like comedies.

**A Certain Magical Index (25/25)**

The first half was poor. It got much better once Index was demoted to extra. Maybe my perspective is ruined because I watched Railgun first, but I just don't like Index as a character. The Sisters arc I already know about from Railgun S, but it was interesting seeing the Touma side of it [Railgun S/Index 1](/s "The fact that Touma was suffering memory loss was a surprise").

Overall I'd give Index a 7/10. The Index and Angel's Fall arcs were poor and drag my overall impression of the show down.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (10/too many)**

Suggested to me by a friend. Not my kind of anime. Not going to finish it.
>> ARTICLE
So you watched railgun s before index?  Would you recommend that order?  I've only watched railgun so far but have heard bad things about index.
>> ARTICLE
I would definitely recommend watching both railgun seasons first.  The events of railgun S occur in the middle of index from Touma's POV, and the railgun S version is much better than the Index version.
>> ARTICLE
If you're going to watch both, it is recommended to start with Index. Personally, I would skip over Index because Touma is really bland as a MC. Railgun S is a must-watch, though.

**Serial Experiments Lain 13/13**
Pretty good watch. Very confusing. 8/10

**Kokoro Connect + OVA 17/17**

I watched  all of **Aldnoah Zero** this week. [Aldnoah Zero Spoilers] (/s "Fuck Slaine") thats all i got to say

Started on **Bakemonogatari** this week as well and it is different from most of the anime that I have watched. Only 3 eps in and i dont know if i should like it or not care for it.

Got the 5th OVA of **Hellsing Ultimate** done after put it off for so long and fell asleep b/c i stayed up way too late and had to rewatch the second half of it. But I thought it was really good but it lacked Alucard and Police girl. it kinda made me sad. But when [Spoilers](/s "Anderson and his buddies came and helped out Integra"), it was awesome.

**The Devil is a Part-Timer!** (13/13)

I went into The Devil is a Part-Timer! totally clueless about it. I mean, other than a bit of light praise here and there, I've never heard anyone talk about it. Turns out, it's a pretty fun show. The characters were super likeable and the dub was pretty solid. Some of the fantasy elements got a little dumb and cheesy at times (I loved the part when Sadao called Lucifer and Olba out on their corny dialogue), but the slice-of-life parts were really solid, and there were quite a few laughs to be had. It wasn't anything spectacular, but I liked it a lot. Here's to hoping there's a second season! 8 outta 10.

**Steins;Gate** (24/24 plus OVA)

Damn, that was a good show! It totally lived up to the hype, 100%. It's definitely gotta be one of the best anime series I've ever had the pleasure of watching, and is definitely one of my new favorites. All the characters were amazing, the story was amazing, the script/voice acting was amazing (I watched it dubbed), and the whole damn thing was amazing. If you haven't watched it yet, do it. You won't be disappointed. Ten outta ten!

**Hetalia Axis Powers** (22/52)

I was a little hesitant about watching Hetalia. The only people who I've ever seen talk about it are weeby teenage girls, so I went into it with low expectations. Much to my surprise, it's actually not half bad. I've enjoyed it so far. I'm laughing a lot more than I thought I would. There have been a few moments (Italy's song about Germany, for example) that I really love, and I think it's fantastic how unapologetically stereotypical the characters are. It makes for some great comedy. It's not an amazing show, but it's definitely funny, entertaining, and likeable enough. 



>> ARTICLE
With Steins, it says that Chaos;Head is related. Do you need to watch that first?
>> ARTICLE
Nope. It exists in the same universe in Steins;Gate, but takes place on a different timeline, so there's almost zero relation between the two. There's also Robotics;Notes, which is the same deal: same universe, different timeline. You can watch the three in any order you want (though I'd definitely recommend Steins;Gate goes first).
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, thanks. I remember reading a few chapters on mangastream a few years back and it seemed kinda interesting.
>> ARTICLE
> Devil is a Part-Timer

> "Nothing spectacular"

> 8/10

I don't think I quite follow.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I rate kinda weirdly. I usually round my scores, since MAL lists can't do decimals. A 7 could be a 6.8, or an 8 a 7.7 (which is the case for Devil is a Part-Timer). By nothing spectacular, I mean it didn't have a huge wow factor or anything, but in the end, I still enjoyed it enough to give it an 8/10 (or a 7.7/10, to be exact).
>> ARTICLE
Watching Golden Time, Toradora, and No Game No Life.   Golden Time's the show I've found myself most attached to but am enjoying all three.

Just finished Toradora as well, just a fantastic show. Anyone on the fence about participating in the Toradora Christmas Club should absolutely do it, first timer or not. I'm planning to rewatch along with it, and I just finished it like a week ago, that's how much I enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
Just knocked down Toradora today myself.  I watched Golden Time while it was airing.  Both are good.  

It took several more episodes for me to start to enjoy Golden Time, it had a greater impact by the end.
>> ARTICLE
Have 2 episodes left of Golden Time which I'll probably watch today.  Nervous about how things will end up.
>> ARTICLE
I'll admit that watching the show was difficult at first.  After [](/s "he comes clean and tells Koko everything about Linda") in Ep12, they became my all-time favorite couple. I would love to see more couples trust each other like they do (in anime and IRL).
>> ARTICLE
**Kokoro Connect (1-17)**

Thoroughly enjoyed this, more than I thought I would. An excellent story about seeing things from others point of view, accepting who you are and a lot of other interesting life lessons. The show had some wonderful moments, some dramatic and some just adorable. [](/s "Iori's near death moment early on was certainly unexpected") I think one of the good things about it as well is that no moment on screen ever felt wasted. There was always some sort of character development going on. The characters are all likeable for different reasons, and even when they do some questionable things or act differently you can understand *why* that is the case.
>> ARTICLE
First 2 arcs of Kokoro were amazing. Last two were a huge disappointment... Rushed and hollow. Its likely attributed to the scandal that occurred during production that someone else mentioned and it really ended up ruining the show sadly...

Oh well Inaban is still my waifu.   
>> ARTICLE
Same! But, I felt a little pissed after hearing about this~

*This is to explain about what happened recently involving members of the cast of Kokoro Connect. Basically what happened was employees of Silver Link (the studio that does Kokoro Connect) and some cast members have been linked to a prank where they created a fake audition for a small supporting role on Kokoro Connect. What happened is they gave the role to newbie VA, who was then told that the whole thing was a fake and was given a job as a PR person as compensation. As a result, there has been a large uproar pretty much ruining any chance for Kokoro Connect to succeed. There have talks to boycott the show and even chances that it will stop airing. As of now, the cast members linked to it are Takuma Terashima (Aoki), Hisako Kanemoto (Yui), and Takahiro Mizushima (Taichi). To sum it up, their careers are fucked.

**Shinsekai Yori** (25/25)

Wow, what an anime. For those of you who are put off by the slow start and the minor yuri/yaoi scenes, stick with it. It's world-building at its finest and develops into something truly amazing.
>> ARTICLE
^ This. Shinsekai Yori is one of those shows that doesn't get enough love for how great it is. Though, I'm really bummed the english dub is the literal worst (*literally*) I've ever witnessed, I was hoping I could recommend it to some friends who aren't big into anime and refuse to watch subs when I heard the dub was coming out. Nooooope. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat, just an hour ago I finished the anime, I agree it did have issues with pacing and inconsistent animation, but the world building combined with the suspenseful atmosphere kept me watching from start to finish. It is truly fantastic.

**Oreimo** (31/31)

Went in expecting pointless incest and it was actually really good.  It seemed a little rushed though (12 books in 31 episodes).  Also the OVAs made me very salty but I like to forget those ever happened.

**Nisekoi** (20/20)

It's like the author is trying to put every single romantic cliche in a single work, but I like shitty romcoms so whatever.  Also Chitoge (I'm a sucker for tsunderes and long hair) and the Shaftiness is great.  

**Hellsing Ultimate** (10/10)

Meh, action and gore really doesn't do too much for me.  Excellent visuals and Alucard was a badass though

Don't bother. It thinks it's critiquing closet otakuism, but it does far more pandering and low-effort gags than any thematic heavy lifting. It has some mildly intriguing brother-sister dynamics early on, but it lost its credibility when it decided to come out and imply that brother-sister romance is somehow okay and desirable.

This is something I wrote on the Friday discussions on r/trueanime. Forgive the repost.

I recently marathoned *Gundam Build Fighters*. Truthfully, as much as I gush about *Gundam Unicorn* on a near daily basis, I haven't watched that much Gundam, and I'd really hesitate to call myself a real fan of the franchise - I've watched *00* and *Seed* and tried (and dropped) *0078*, *G-Reco* and *A New Translation*, and I've personally found them all mediocre at best. Until now, the only Gundams I really liked were *Unicorn* and *08th MS Team*

Now, I can add *Gundam Build Fighters* that list. For what is an unabashed kid toys commercial, this was seriously charming. Which is strange - it doesn't do a lot that I would normally really respect in anime, but GBF makes up for good writing and interesting themes by injecting a trillion cc's of ham and charm into everything about it's story. I was kind of cool on Reiji and Sei in the beginning, but the show did a great job in endearing themselves to you by stressing them and showing off all the different sides to their personalities. The show also knew the right balance of shipping to entice romantic speculation without ever making it the main focus, using it as a source of humor for the most part and a way to endear you further to characters you already know and love (Kirara and Fellini were lovable goofballs apart, but watching them get a crush on each other and then start to treat each other as partners made this captain go all doki-doki.) I initially liked the robot fights because it let me geek out over the mobile suits (I freaked when they recreated the Apsalus canyon trap scene from the *08th MS Team*), but they became good in their own right, as the show went nuts and used their mecha in ever more creative and over-the-top ways (the baseball match with Luang Dallara was, the GM Sniper with detachable artillery, Sengoku Astray with a fucking rocket-propelled hammer, etc.) 

If there's any real criticism I'd have, it's that Reiji's background and the role of the Kingdom of Arian made exactly zero sense. Granted, it had little to do with the story anyway, but given how often it came up towards the end of the show, I'm surprised at how little explanation or closure they gave for that plot-thread - I mean, you'd think a magic kingdom with teleporting princes and particles that can make plastic fight would warrant a wee bit of explanation, ne? But, honestly, it's periphery to the show - it didn't stop me for getting misty-eyed when I saw Reiji disintegrate and return to Arian (or cheer when we found out Aila went with him.)

Unfortunately, having gone into *Gundam Build Fighters* four nights ago, I can't say I like it's sequel nearly as much. As I bitched to /u/ShadowZael [over twitter](https://twitter.com/cptngarlock/status/538207449292218368), it seemed to work under the assumption that I could carry over my fondness for the original characters (newsflash: it doesn't work that way) onto the new ones and so skipped a lot of the character building moments. Sekai is a bad Reiji ripoff, with all of Reiji's boring qualities (obliviousness, fight maniac) and none of his good ones (being a dick, easily angered, great reaction faces). Fumina is nice, but they didn't give enough depth to her to really make me root for her. And their method of making you care for the characters in GBFT seems to be to set up ships as fast as possible, which I find really lazy - the shipping in GBF was icing on top of a great cake, not the core of their characters; Aila was even better when she was all tsun for Reiji, but she was still great on her own. 

>> ARTICLE
You mean 0079? Also you probably won't get much of New Translation if you didn't watch 0079. + I have never once seen someone recommend watching New Translation instead of the Zeta series. G-Reco has actually gotten better recently; the production values have gotten a lot better since the beginning. Did you actually understand what was going on with Unicorn? I was under the impression it was steeped in UC lore. This is all coming from a Gundam Noob as well but someone who absolutely adored 0079 and Zeta.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I meant 0079, and I already know the plot of most of the UC Gundams (except possible *ZZ Gundam*.) I tried to go for *A New Translation* because I don't have the time or patience to work through a 50 episode series if I can't guarantee it'll be great, so I thought a briefer version would work - it didn't. I have heard that the 0079 movie trilogy is rather good, though, so I may try that. 

>G-Reco

I seem to have issues with Tomino's direction overall (I think his style is really abrupt, his shot framing a little weird and his dialog just plain bizarre), and [I have so many shows I'm already watching this season](http://i.imgur.com/DB8Rhuw.png) that I have little motivation to get back to it. I do ask around on the neighborhood of anitwitter with tastes similar to mine how the show's going, but I haven't had a lot of positive feedback. Maybe I'll give it another spin over Christmas.

>Unicorn

It's been a slow process. I didn't understand much of it when I watched the first OVA 4 years ago, but over time (mostly because of a fascination with Gundam universe) I've gotten the knowledge to really understand a lot of the implications of it's plot. I honestly didn't have a really great opinion of the series until the final few episode, which brought it all together. This came to a head with the last two episodes, which I still watch on a semi-regular basis because of how moving I find them (I still cry a little when I hear Ensign Riddhe whisper "No...what have...what have I done..." after Marida reached out to him.) 

Gundam has always been about the past guiding the future, a fear of the unknown, and about the few abusing the many, but *Unicorn* really distilled all of this into a concise, cohesive manner (albeit one that requires a lot of foreknowledge to really appreciate) that get's pushed into masterpiece territory with Hiroyuki Sawano's soundtrack. I can safely say it's one of my favorite anime (MAL agrees!)   
>> ARTICLE
The 0079 trilogy is very good; that's what I did to get into Gundam. It cuts out a lot of filler and fixes up some of the worse animation. The reason people don't like "A New Translation" as a substitute is because allegedly it looks really awkward to switch between old and new graphics and the end of it retcons ZZ gundam. 

Yea I thought Unicorn would be difficult. I'll get to it after finishing the proper UC chronology personally. Don't watch to mess up my enjoyment of Gundam even the slightest. 
>> ARTICLE
Zeta has a heck of a lot less filler to cut than 0079, basically. The Zeta movies are basically incomprehensible because there's just too much pressed into not enough time. The 0079 movies, however, have two big things working in their favor. The big one is that it has a proper ending (the original Mobile Suit Gundam was a flop and got cancelled). The second is that the show was still essentially a kid's robot show from the 70s. There's a lot of monster-of-the-week type episodes that don't really do much for the plot or greater themes or anything, they're to introduce new toys. So the movies chop out a lot of pointless content.

Zeta's great but 50 episodes is a lot of time to invest, that's for sure.

How well is the translation done? I've tried reading a few fan-translated light novels in the past, but I wasn't able to enjoy them very much.

The fan translated ones were taken down when the novels were licensed in English.

So far, in the official releases, I haven't come across any weird grammatical errors but there is going to be a debate on whether it is Horo or Holo for her name.

Oh, I didn't realize they had official English releases. Holo will always be Holo in my mind though :p

Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
If the anime is considered canon, it's Holo. Her signature is clearly visible on a contract in the Pyrite arc.
>> ARTICLE
They're really well done I'd say. The anime did a great job of adapting the novels and the tone of the story is identical in both. Reading the novels felt like watching the anime, really. You can easily hear the characters voices and picture the scenes and whatnot.

Oh, wow. I'll definitely give them a try. Thanks!

**Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (10-20/24)**

So far I've been pretty impressed with Sakurasou, its got a lot of heart.  However I feel like the series loses quite a bit of steam in the middle.  There is a big shift towards drama and I think it gets a little too melodramatic even for high schoolers, particularly with regards to Sorata and Shiina, some of Sorata's interactions with Shiina feel contradictory to his character.

That being said I really like the romance between some of the side characters [particularly between](/s "Jin and Misaki, sure it was a little melodramatic but I'm really glad it worked out in the end as Misaki is just not the same when she isn't being a crazy alien.")

I'm interested to see how things wrap up in the final few episodes, there is obviously two big relationships that need to be resolved and I'm interested to see how it goes. **Current Impression: 8/10**

**Cowboy Bebop (12-18)**

I posted last week that while I thought the show was good I didn't find it particularly amazing, but these episodes have started to make me understand why Bebop has remained relevant for so long. Getting some backstories on Spike, Jet, and Faye made their characters feel vastly improved, and much more complex. I appreciate that I don't just find them likable now, but am able to sympathize better with their actions. I'm having a hard time guessing where the show is going, since what I'm assuming is the main story arc is kind of few and far between, but hopefully they've just been saving it for the end of the show. I'm not convinced that I'm going to give it anything above an 8 at this point, but conclusions are important so this is subject to change.
>> ARTICLE
You're pretty right about that - the 'main story arc' is not so much the story  itself but rather the episodes themselves that reflect how each of them have developed a relationship together are. The fact that this ragtag team of outlaw space cowboys rounded up together into some funky band of misfits is what the show itself is really about (or at least, that's what I think, after thinking about it for some time). I don't want to spoil too much about the ending but you're pretty right - I'll just say that after watching it, you might have to think about the series as a whole and what it was about rather than basing it all on the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you also have to understand. Most anime from that point in time had to be episodic. Each episode has a definite beginning, end, and maybe a little overarching sorry in between. It's much easier to watch shows in marathon order in 2014-15 with netflix, crunchy, recorders, etc then when bebop was made. Someone had to click the TV on, with no knowledge of previous events and enjoy it. Bobop took this and knocked it out of the park. The first anime episode I ever watched was almost at the end of bebop, the "I hate the circus" episode. Got me hooked, and here I am. Bastards got me!
>> ARTICLE
It's probably only an 8, but still a "must watch" 8.
>> ARTICLE
I'm now on episode 18 of NGE, I like it and hate it at the same time. Apparently the rebuild movies are better though.  
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way as you about NGE and I love the Rebuilds to death, so take that for whatever it's worth.
>> ARTICLE
Your opinion of the Rebuilds depends on your opinion of the series. The animation is gorgeous but at the same time they cut out a lot of material and a lot of totally different material. Overall it's very different with different focuses. 
>> ARTICLE
The rebuilds are better in the sense that there is less focus on Shinji being annoying but to be honest, if you didn't enjoy the focus on each character's problems, NGE shouldn't be the show for you anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
If you liked Evangelion, you'll like 1.0. If you didn't like Evangelion and just want action hero Shinji, you'll like 2.0. And if you want Evangelion stripped down to its barest core without any of the horseshit, you'll love 3.0, but even if you hate it, Anno still wins.
>> ARTICLE
The series is about to get a lot better episodes 18-24 and EoE are the reasons why the series is so good imo and I don't think that the rebuilds are much better but that could change after the release of Evangelion 3.00+1.00. 
>> ARTICLE
I recently watched Haikyu!! after writing off in the blink of an eye when it was first recommended to me. This anime was absolutely amazing, I was shocked at how invested in the characters and matches I was. The show doesn't really pull too much bullshit superpowers out to make it exciting, as far as I can tell this stays pretty true to the real life sport. I can't wait for season 2, I was one of those guys who didn't see the point of sports anime but after watching Haikyu I have just started Kuroko no basket and added Hajime no Ippo to my plan to watch list. Easily a 9/10.  
>> ARTICLE
Currently marathoning Madoka Magica...jesus this shit gets dark. I can see why people like it. After the first two and a half episodes, this is certainly no magical girl series. I don't know what this is, but damn do I like it.

**Code Geass R2 (16-25/25)**  

Well played Code Geass, you did it.  
When an anime manages to have a great ending, I tend to forget its flaws.  
And that ending was awesome. The two lasts songs, "Madder Sky" and "Continued Story" are beautiful and fit so well. (I keep listening to them since I finished CG).  

That being said, I can't overlook the fact that, overall, the first season was better.  
It seems that the writers themselves were not sure what to do in the middle of R2. And one thing that bothered me is the part with Lelouch's parents : [](/s "For the majority of the show, Charles seems to be the "final boss", and Marianne not being dead is kinda huge since her death is pretty much the start of the story. But these two things get cleared up in one episode like it's not a big deal.")

In the end, I give this second season **8/10**, mostly thanks to the ending.

Funny thing, after rating Code geass, I lowered a bunch of my others ratings. As if giving "only" 8 to CG made me realize I overrated them.
>> ARTICLE
I heard that most of the plot of R2 was Redone to make it more "kid-friendly" because it got moved to a new time slot. 
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily to make it kid-friendly. It was moved from a late Thursday night slot to a late afternoon Saturday slot. This prompted several changes: no more nudity/sexual content, somewhat lighter themes, and toning down the racism/drugs/whatever to focus on mecha action.

Basically, the writers had to redo the entire plot of the second season. From what I understand, the ending is pretty much what they wanted to have happen, but several other things were changed drastically, such as sticking in the time skip (there originally was no year time skip between seasons and the anime simply would have picked up right where R1 left off), changing the Geass story (and Suzaku's connection to it, as hinted by C2's interactions with him in S1), and the introduction of new characters and dropping certain plotlines (like apparently Lelouch was supposed to join the Black Knights as himself, disguised as a girl, for some reason which leads to some awkwardness.)

Overall, there was a huge tonal shift from character drama to action-mecha drama because of this time slot move. Personally, I would have liked to see how Code Geass was originally planned. R1 was fantastic. R2 was of questionable quality with the exception of its ending.

To give an example of the kinds of things R2 no longer had: Table-kun.
>> ARTICLE
> Funny thing, after rating Code geass, I lowered a bunch of my others ratings. As if giving "only" 8 to CG made me realize I overrated them.

I do that too, adjusting other series relative to a new one. Certain series have dropped in score repeatedly as a result.

**[Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) (153-156/201)** - A short week but contains one of my favorite scenes in the series, silent film era Elizabeth. [More in the weekly thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2nrdkd/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_153156/)

**[Angel Beats!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!) (5-13/13)** - Another series, another ending that made me tear up. [AB! ep 10](/s "Yui finding happiness with Hinata and the montage of their normal life made me cry more though.") As good as My Soul, Your Beats! is, I think I might like the ending, [Brave Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkEZ3V1hSHg), even more.

I remember hearing from other people before I started that it should have been longer than 13 episodes. I have to agree and that's the primary issue I have with the series. The plot itself ended up feeling somewhat rushed and half of the characters received no development after the first couple of episodes. [AB! all/story arcs](/s "Naoi's turn as a villain barely lasted an episode and it could have been so much better if given time to develop. Similarly the Angel clones were resolved after an episode. The shadows had two episodes and that part was paced well by comparison.")

[AB! all/character development](/s "It makes sense to withhold Kanade's history until the end, but aside from her only Iwasawa, Hinata, Naoi, Otonashi, Yui, and Yuri have any details of their lives shown. As I look at that list that seems like a lot, but there are still another half-dozen characters that I ended up knowing nothing about. Otonashi falling in love with Kanade made little sense on the surface as they weren't doing a lot together on screen that wasn't fighting, and similarly Hinata and Yui seemed to have a greater connection than the impression I had.")

[Last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2n75zp/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cmb1epo) I mentioned that I thought I knew where the series was headed and I wasn't entirely wrong there. [AB! eps 10-13](/s "Yui's episode fit that expectation exactly, Yuri helped herself, and Otonashi helped Naoi and Kanade to their ends.") Still, as mentioned above it didn't get nearly enough time for the majority of the supporting cast to get their moment.

Ultimately, the greatest villain of the series was time itself. As Yuri said, [AB! ep 11](/s "It's pretty common in video games, ya know? An invincible monster shows up to keep you from playing forever.") Another season could have made it fantastic; a few more episodes to develop supporting characters, expand and develop a couple of the plot lines some more, and strengthen the relationships between the main characters. I love what's there, I just wish there was more of it. **Rating: 8/10**

You cant just go posting brave song out and the open mannnnnnn. It hurts too much :(

With you there 100 percent.  Angel Beats was actually the first anime I ever saw, and holy crap was I not ready.  I heard that the original plan for Angel Beats was originally 20-24 episodes, but it was changed for some reason, much to Maeda's discontent.

**Aldnoah.Zero 9/10:** I finished it early this week, it was pretty awesome to me, since I haven't really watched much from the mecha genre (only Code Geass and Guilt Crown if that counts). It was a good show and I really liked the underdog concept. Something that made me like it more then Code Geass R2 was that there was more strategy since the earthlings are inferior to the marsians, and it wasn't the biggest shiniest mech wins. Also Fuck Slaine.

**Durararararara 8/10 --> ep 13:** Really good show up till now. Can't say I've found any real problems with it. It's entertaining, funny and quite mysterious. I'm looking forward to seeing how it's gonna progress.

Been quite a slow week for me on the anime side. By my usual standard I would have at least finished Durarararara by now but I've been busy reading the UBW route in the Fate/Stay Night VN.

I just finished watching [Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) (not yet watched the End of Evangelion) and it was great. The character interactions were really enjoyable and believable, and I actually really liked Shinji as a main character. There were times when I had no idea what was going on, but it was still great. My big complaint though, is the last 2 episodes. It seems like the budget just disappeared. They just repeated the same question multiple times in several different ways, just to end it with [Evangelion](/s "Shinji accepting himself"), and while that was definitely nice, I feel like it was executed rather poorly. Looking forward to watching EoE, as I've heard it's more of a "true" ending. 
>> ARTICLE
You'll love EoE then. The message of the ending is fairly similar but with far more actual plot and twists and stunning art and visuals. It should answer your complaints with ease and then some. 
>> ARTICLE
I, too, finished Evangelion recently, then went on to watch EoE and all three rebuild films over the course of a couple days.

My only real gripe with the series is that I feel it did not explain its backstory well enough...or at all, really. I came out of the 26 episodes saying to myself "Ok so what the fuck is this lance thing again?" and wondering how some of the more major plot elements actually worked. After reading a lengthy explanation, I can safetly say that Evangelion is among the best the medium has to offer.
>> ARTICLE
Watched this first season of Code Geass this week and HOLY. SHIT. I LOVED IT. It kept me excited though the whole thing and Lelouch's brains was awesome. Lelouch must have some guts to be able to [Major Code Geass Spoilers] (/s "kill his half-brother and half-sister and make one of his friends forget that he exists as well").  The openings were great too. Oh and pizza. lots of pizza hut. C.C's reaction after [Small Code Geass Spoiler Ep 21](/s "Suzaku dropped the giant pizza onto a tree during the school festival") was priceless imo.

Watch FLCL earlier this week. I wanted to watch something short and there was some people on this subreddit that said FLCL was short and good and they were right. I thought it was good and the animation style was good too. The only bad part about it is that a sixth grader got more action then I might see.

Watched Hellsing Ultimate VI this week and really good. Seras was a beast that episode. Still cant wait for Alucard to go all OP mode on them vampire nazis.


Watched some more Bakemonogatari as well and still dont know how i should feel about it.

really nothing else but Code Geass was the highlight of this week

I marathoned all of [**Anohana**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai.) two days ago. I went into this show completely blind and didn't even know what it was going to be about. I picked up this show by watching the OPs of a bunch of myanimelist's top anime and then choosing what I liked best.

What I ended up getting out of Anohana was my new favorite show. It's my number 1 now beating out Steins;Gate. I went into this show not knowing anything about it and ended up getting one of the most emotional rides of my life. I felt so bad for the tragedy of each and every character after Menma's death, especially Jintan. I feel like the reason this show resonated with me so much is that I could have easily seen myself taking up any of these character's roles if I had lost a friend at that age. Not only that, but the soundtrack is phenomenal and the story and writing is utterly fantastic. Menma was such a fantastic character and made me laugh and depressed at the same time.

**Rating: 10/10**

If anyone is interested, the next show I'm picking up that I know nothing about will be Mushishi, so I hope it's good.

**[Monster](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=19)** 22-29

Despite me being on break I didn't watch much anime this week. It's not that Monster is bad (in fact it's the exact opposite) but I just didn't feel like it.

During this stretch a character was introduced that is voiced by Cam Clarke (yes I'm watching the dub). Cam Clarke voiced Kratos in Tales of Symphonia who is one of my favorite Tales characters. He doesn't do much anime so I was kind of excited to hear him.

[Spoilers](/s "Kind of a shame his character died so quickly since he was really interesting. Johan is brutal. Anyone who gets close to finding out anything must be eliminated.")
>> ARTICLE
I get that when it's Monster we're talking about.  I loved it, but still took 2-3 months to finish it.  It was definitely worth it though.




>> ARTICLE
They reuse a lot of the English voice actors in the dub. There's a good chance you will hear him again.

I watched all of D-frag! plus the OVA - and I was surprised by how good it was. 

I went into it expecting a mildly amusing comedy with cliche character archetypes and actually, it was very far from that. 

First of all, *it was hilarious*, and this is coming from someone who didn't find Noucome - apparently the funniest recent comedy - at all humorous. I think the fact that the characters were so loveable and *unique* made it funnier, actually.

Speaking of the characters... so hard to choose best girl. :c I loved Roka, Takao, and Funabori all equally. And Tama, Sakura, and Noe were all super cute too. I think Takao wins out though. 

Its moments of non-comedy were quite good, as well. Particularly Takao's 'date'. :D

I rated it a 8.5/10 which is a pretty high rating for me to give a straight-comedy show, usually it has to have romance or some other genre *as well as* comedy for me to rate it higher.

Yay D-Frag. I myself didn't find Noucome to be very funny, because it mainly just came down to crass humor. At least D-Frag had a nice mix of various different comedy types. Although your choice of [best girl](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140331062406/d-fragments/images/1/18/Sakura_Mizukami_infobox.png) is rather faulty.

**Monogatari series Second Season (23/26)**   
Overall, Monogatari has proven to be an extremely solid work. Having seen nearly everything that is currently animated, I can certainly say that I really like the series. The second season takes everything good about the series and takes it to the next level, giving us insight into the nature of several characters. I have to say I was greatly impressed by the Tsubasa Tiger and Nadeko Medusa arcs, and can't wait to watch the conclusion of Hitagi's arc. Good job Shaft. ^^Kizu ^^when

**Melody of Oblivion (5/24)**  
This looks ... pretty goddamn generic. The premise is cookie-cutter shounen, and somehow every single character is an asshole. The music's pretty good though, and the way the monsters are portrayed makes for some interesting and quite creepy scenes. Overall I'm not expecting too much.
>> ARTICLE
I finished the second season of **Chihayafuru** this week. Watched season 2 right after finishing the first one. When I started it I did not expect much, the Josei tag turned me off but I saw it was highly rated and getting recommended here often so I gave it a try. I quickly got attached to the characters and hooked by their passion and struggle to achieve their goal. While the first season seemed a bit slow at times, shit got real in the second. This anime has it all: gorgeoous animation and music (still listening to OST often), great chracters, emotions, tension and a bit of romance. I have a hard time finding bad points. The only things I would have liked is more Arata owning everyone since he is listed as a main character but got less screentime than some club members, and maybe a bit more developed romance. Overall a very beautiful and heartwarming anime, highly recommended. I gave the first season **8/10** and the second one **9/10**. Season 3 when??

**A Certain Scientific Railgun** and **A Certain Scientific Railgun S**.

Wow, just, really, wow. I had heard some not so great things about Index, so I didn't go into the show with high expectations, but I'll be damned if this show hasn't blow what little expectations I had out of the water. I could probably rave about it for a good twenty minutes, but I'll just say that if you like sci-fi or tsunderes at all, this is a good show for you.

i couldn't get into railgun, it felt like a super slow start.  Its actually one of the only two animes i've ever dropped, the other being Nanoha Lyrical Striker S
>> ARTICLE
You're not wrong there. Railgun is pretty slow at times.

However, when it picks up, it hits the ground running.

Then takes a break.

And then starts again.

To each their own, I guess. And I actually do agree about Nanoha, considering it's one of three or four I've dropped.

**[Jigoku Youchien](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16692)**

I have this really peculiar affinity for fundamentally awful anime. Not the "Oh, I hate this genre so it sucks." awful. Not the "just another moeblob so it sucks" awful. Not even the "Insert-character-here sucks so it sucks." awful. And especially not simply the "lol everyone sit around and circlejerk and be edgy anime fans lol" awful. I mean absolutely completely and fully bad in every possible aspect. And Hell Kindergarten was definitely one of those. I wouldn't have even thought about watching it except for /u/MissyPie's comment in last week's Y'all thread.

It made absolutely zero sense. The characters were just thrown together with no purpose. There were exactly three backgrounds for the entire show. The character design was pathetic. And, being a Flash-based show, the lips didn't even move. 

There is no saving grace to this anime, and it shouldn't ever exist in this world. Then again, that's probably what Japan would say about some of *our* Flash-based [animation experiments.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgw60gb00B8)

Score: 3/10  
Recommendation Level: I really wouldn't.

[**Gatchaman Crowds**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18229)

This one was on my radar due to my faint childhood memories of the old USian adaptation of [Kagaku Ninja-Tai Gatchaman](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2389/Kagaku_Ninja-Tai_Gatchaman), because Battle Of The Planets was absolutely mindblowing to me at the time. Yes, even moreso than Macross was. So something based on the same universe as that would be an absolute must-watch for me...

... and I'm kicking myself for not getting to this one sooner than this. I really am. Because it was incredible, and with wonderful characters from top to bottom. The plot took a *long* time to get to the point but, once it did, it was a roller coaster ride all the way to the finish. And, even better, they've set themselves up for a sequel that is already on my will-watch list when it comes out next year.

Yet the slow start is the Achilles heel of the anime. Between the feeling of "Where the hell is this going?" and the overly genki-girl MC being annoying as all hell, this one will lose people in the first episode. Yet, in a Madoka-ish way, everything picks up briskly after the third episode. So even if the first episode falls a bit flat for you, maintain that 3-Episode Rule. This is a title that is worth it.

Score: 8/10  
Recommendation Level: *BIIIIIIIIIIIIRD, GO!!!*

[**Sidonia no Kishi**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19775)  

An old friend of mine called last night and told me that she was going to cancel her subscription for the next month or few and wondered if I wanted to watch anything. She had to go work an extra shift last night, so it wasn't like she was going to be able to do anything with it. And I, being the greedy bastard that I am, graciously accepted a free night of entertainment. So after knocking down a couple of Hollywood blockbusters, I finally sat down and went through Knights of Sidonia.

And it had some problems.

First off, the animation itself. CG works wonders for mecha titles like Sidonia, particularly for the combat scenes, yet it leaves the characters washed-out and bland. Multiple times through the series found me wondering exactly which characters were talking in a given scene, as Same Face Syndrome ran rampant throughout every single character model. And, just as the character models were indistinguishable from each other at times, the characters themselves were thinly-veiled trope machines all the way across the board. At no time was I actually impressed with them. Even worse, I was able to sit and predict exactly what was going to happen and how the characters were going to behave given the setup of the scene. I absolutely hate it when that happens.

The saving grace of Sidonia? The worldbuilding. The seed-ships, the mecha, the Gauna, the society itself: they were all wonderfully filled out with little sprinkles of history and subtle details that brought a different kind of life to the series. It's not what most people look for in an anime, but I positively love it when it happens.

(Quick aside: The final episode also had a few callbacks to Gunbuster, the great mecha anime that brought a number of tropes to the forefront of the genre. I love it when I see anime influences like that.)

Score: 7/10  
Recommendation level: If mecha is your thing, you've probably already seen it. If mecha is not your thing, there's nothing special to drag you in.

On-deck: I'm still trying to figure that out, as nothing in my queue is jumping out at me just yet.

Katanagatari 7/12

So far pretty enjoyable even if Im not the biggest fan of the art style. But is there supposed to be any chemistry between the maincharacters? It feels like it is brick and brick. Also the male MC seems to have less emotions than inaho.

Deadman wonderland 12/12: This got worse the further it gets to the end and the ending is just plain disapointing. Somehow the episodes didnt really feel connected to each other. At least the fights are fun to watch. somewhere between a five and a 6. Is the Manga worth picking up or does it get even worse?

WAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY to much. I had a four day weekend and absolutely nothing to do. I prepared many shows in advance, but I ended up watching the following: 

**To Aru Magitsu no Index (24/24):** 

Amazing. Don't think about it too hard, however, you might accidentally summon a world ending angel that just *looks* like an Orthodox Russian ~~temptress~~ priestess. Oh and reprogramming the brains of sick bio-robo-loli's is ezpz. 

**To Aru Magitsu no Index II (9/24):**

Watching this right now, so far (along with the closing arc of Index season one) it's pretty much *"By the way, we do Punch Bitches: The Anime"*.

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica (12/12)** (re-re-watch):

First that I've watched the show after watching Rebellion and the first time I've watched the show over again in one sitting. Such a good decision. The pained looks from Homura in the earlier episodes hold so much more impact the third time through. 

**Hyouka (13/22):**

I decided half way through this one that I didn't really like the marathon game, but that I should definitely finish it. That's what I'm probably going to finish this next weekend.

All this in addition to what I'm watching for the current season... It was an amazing thanksgiving week for anime. Helped cover up the fact that I spent it away from home for the first time.

About five minutes ago I finished **tamako market**. I personally considered it a superb piece of work. the goal of the show was overwhelming MOE and boy did it deliver. the story never reached a down point and while there was some drama, I kept smiling throughout the whole show. 

Overall a very well done Feel-Good anime.

**Durarara episodes 2-7** 

Okay, I admit, I watched the first episode a while ago, got bored, and put it up. I decided to try again as a last ditch effort for the upcoming winter season and I must say that I was overall pleasantly surprised. 

The first episode gave off a mostly slice of life vibe with a little mystery. Had I not seen the review and reaction videos on youtube, I might have completely dismissed it, but I tried. Anyways, things begin opening up in the second episode. The next handful of episodes are all focused around the first episode, though they show all the stuff that happens behind the scenes. 

Things really got rolling when we had our episode that was dedicated to the black rider. One mystery was solved, leaving twenty more questions. I had my first "moment" in the series when we see [black rider spoilers](/s "Celty's head on the girl")

So far, Durarara is going pretty well. It's nice that these first few episodes are some that you can either binge watch or watch one episode a day. Even though it has a ridiculous cast of characters for its length, I haven't mixed them up yet, something that I am ridiculously bad at in other shows. Names on the other hand, well I'm bad at those in general. Anyways, I've heard that once the show starts going, it really gets going, so I am very eager to get to that. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know man. I'm stuck at ep 13 or so and just can't bring myself to finish it. And it's weird as i actually enjoy it! I love characters and and story as well as the whole "everyone is grey" thing (actually I find it really amazing) but then I can't don't feel need to watch it anymore ;/
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean though. Like, I'll look at the next episode on Crunchyroll and think, "ehh. I can watch it later." Like, once I start I'm fine, but otherwise I just sit there thinking, "huh, I should probably get back on durarara at some point."

I finished JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusader and I finished watching Toradora a few minutes ago.

I seem to have gotten into anime at the perfect time too! 

In fact, I'll tell you why:

SAO and AoT are the first two anime I've watched in quite a few years, and right when I finished watching SAO, SAO II was announced.

Then I watched some other shit. 

Then I watched JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and Stardust, and the new season is being released soon. LUCKY!

[**Clannad: After Story \(13-24/24\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad:_After_Story)

Mostly what I expected. I still managed to enjoy this series immensely even after being spoiled [critical spoilers](/s "Ushio's death"), and it gave me many memorable moments. This is one of the easiest anime to rate (highly), but there is something that stops it from being my #1, and that's [](/s "the absence of the support characters after graduation, sure they come back now and then but they are mostly forgotten, though of course you can't put everything into 24 episodes"). Still I'd put it as a must watch for everyone.  

[
**Steins;Gate \(4-5/24\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate)

Basically my plan here is to find something that can potentially replace my current #1. I'm well aware that <episode 12 is the "slower" part of Steins;Gate, but I must say I'm quite enjoying the series right now. Yes episode 5 only had 5 minutes of actual plot, but there's no harm in exploring Okabe's relationships with the lab members, and it does seem Kurisu(tina) has more similarities with Okabe than expected. Also is that foreshadowing with the [spoilers](/s "scene when Kurisu says Okabe has poor strategic sense?") I mean Kurisu already insults Okabe regularly, but the line just stood out to me. Anyways so far so good, but I haven't seen enough yet to get an accurate rating, should finish by next week though.

**Hidamari Sketch x Honeycomb (12/12)**

Welp, the last season of Hidamari. Probably my favorite of the four. Still comfy and [wide](http://i.imgur.com/lLZUmCQ.jpg) as ever. Pretty *shafty* animation, so it's solid on that end. The comedy is great, not as hit-or-miss as before, or perhaps I'm just used to it's style. Bretty good ending, although I'd wish they focus on the graduation part a little more, but that's what those [OVAs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17739/Hidamari_Sketch:_Sae_Hiro_Sotsugyou-hen) are for right? Let's hope so. 8/10

**Fairy Tail (41-49/175)**

At this point in my relationship with Fairy Tail, I'm just seeing how much bullshit I can tolerate. So far I can tolerate 49 episodes of this shit. Let's see how far we can [go](http://i.imgur.com/1s7nY6g.png). Just finished the next *really evil villain guy* arc and starting a new one I think. This show sucks, man/10

**Space Battleship Yamato 2199 (11/26)**

I'm surprised I don't hear about this anime more often. I stumbled upon it by chance while browsing through a list of sci-fi anime. From what I've seen, it definitely deserves more attention. The premise of mankind uniting to fight a desperate battle against an alien race isn't exactly original, but this show manages to pull it off in a way that reminds me a lot of Halo, which I'm a huge fan of. The characters are not the most dynamic, but then again I'm not even halfway through yet. I'm liking the romantic subplot so far (Yuki best girl), and I hope it actually goes somewhere by the end. Also, the animations are really good. I'm a huge fan of naval combat (yes, apparently space is considered the sea), so the fights between the battleships are great eye candy for me, especially with the great 3d animations. The one thing I'm kinda disturbed by is how weak the ships are... Even in Halo, where human ships are considered FAR weaker than the Covenant's(At least at first), a frigate wouldn't explode from a single shot, but the ships in *Yamato* (apart from the important ones of course) all seem to be made of cardboard... or at least lined with explosives of some sort, considering the magnificent fireballs that happen every time one gets shot.

I fucked around with like 14 different series and then finally settled on watching the first episode of Madoka Magica, which I finished just seconds ago. 
>> ARTICLE
What'd you think of it? Don't forget to watch the third movie Rebellion if you enjoyed the series! Its the conclusive ending to the show, though some would argue the show's was better. 

I personally really enjoyed the visuals and soundtrack but was less impressed by the kind of predictable ending. 


>> ARTICLE
i need somewhere to waaatch that
>> ARTICLE
I thought the visuals and soundtrack were top-notch, and the character interactions were pretty realistic. I definitely like the relationship between Sayaka and Madoka, and their third friend. I'm interested to see what happens with Madoka. 
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, the visuals were among the weakest things in Madoka. So many "quality" scenes and the witch world was too weird for me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching the BD's so every "quality" scene should be touched up at least, and I'm loving the hell out of the witch world.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god. I feel like I misunderstand your comments on a really consistent basis. I thought you said that you had finished the entire series not just the first episode. I'm glad I didn't spoil anything.

Anyway, I'll say that the character interactions are pretty great. I personally enjoyed Sayaka the most out of all the characters and Madoka, the least. She's supposed to be like that though since it has relevance to the plot. 

Btw, have you finished HxH yet? I seem to remember that you were watching it but it hasn't felt like long enough for you to finish it. 

>> ARTICLE
I've already had half of the story spoiled for me like [Spoiler](/s "Madoka being god, and Homura time looping to constantly save her life") among many other things. 

I watched episodes 1-29 of HxH, but I've gotta say it's definitely not the best thing since sliced bread. It's pretty generic at the moment to be honest, and I'm really not liking the new characters, or the story itself in Heaven's Arena.
>> ARTICLE
That sucks. People often tend to complain that Madoka relies heavily on shock factor and as a pretty big PMMM fan I'm inclined to disagree but it is true that the twists are a pretty big part of the enjoyment. 

I honestly don't want to be one of those people that tell you "it gets better later on"  even though thats what I believe. I'll agree that HxH does have many generic elements. I enjoyed the Heaven's Arena arc and the Greed Island/Yorknew arcs(the following arcs) are my favorites so I think that it probably isn't the show for you. The only arc that really feels like the show changes is the Chimera Ant arc which would be ~50 episodes that you'd have to drudge through to get to. You'd have better time spent. Don't take my word for granted though as I doubt I'm the best expert on HxH around here.
>> ARTICLE
It's not like I don't enjoy HxH. I'll watch a few episodes here and there. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh I assumed you were dropping it since you're looking for a new series and that you said you didn't enjoy it. That's good then since I do think the series gets better and better as it proceeds. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I just don't have the attention span to watch the same series for 148 episodes without stopping.
>> ARTICLE
God I would never understand that. I feel like I would need a bigger attention span to try to watch two series at once(unless they're airing). Its impossible for me to be able to remember each episode.  
>> ARTICLE
>Even on a non opinion related thread

This *is* an opinion thread. You're supposed to talk about what you watched, just saying that you watched an episode of something doesn't really encourage discussion.

Why didn't you watch one of the other 14 shows? What do you think of Madoka so far?
>> ARTICLE
I rarely participate in these, sorry then. It was totally my fault. 

As always I like the Shaft visuals and the odd directing style that Shinbo has, and the sound was top notch. I thought the character interactions were very realistic with the middle schoolers gossiping about random things as they would, and everything really felt like it took place in a middle school. I particularly like the ^^^yuri ^^^undertones relationship between Sayaka, Madoka, and the other unnamed girl. I'm interested to see how things develop between Madoka and Homura as well.

EDIT : I just wasn't in the mood for FLCL, and I can not find a reasonable place to download Kino's Journey. There were quite a few other series that I just wasn't feeling.

Sorry if I seemed annoyed, just trying to get people to write.

I finally finished Bakemonogatari, which was a great watch.

And I also continued Mawaru Penguindrum from where I left off (episode 6). I am currently at episode 12.

I still have almost no fucking clue what is going on. But it isn't as bad anymore. Still really weird.

After that I'll watch Steins;Gate.

Inu x Boku SS, I think I'm on the third episode.  It's pretty cool so far, I looked into it because anything with dark haired dark eyed girl characters gets a chance.

OniAi, sixth episode.  Similar to above as to why, but also because incest is my guilty pleasure trope. ^^^he ^^^said ^^^knowing ^^^there's ^^^no ^^^way ^^^to ^^^say ^^^that ^^^without ^^^being ^^^creepy

C^3, episode nine.  It's alright, I kind of wish it would decide on a tone since it jumps from dramatic to cornball and vice versa real quick.

Shuffle! numero acht.  Not really far enough to say much but it's enjoyable.

Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo episode eight.  Again not really far enough to form much of an opinion but I hope it keeps being this fun to watch.
>> ARTICLE
TTGL. Posted my doubts on this show in a thread before i watched it, but i ended up enjoying it a lot. I feared i would not be able to turn of my mind and go with the show, and while i didnt fully accomplish that i still found it insanely fun. I understand why so many people think so highly of it. That said i could not forgive the show for its complete disregard for realism, especially physics,  no space suits in space anyone? But that over the top element made the show fun, even though it isnt my cup of tea. Also rossiu joins my list of unbearable characters along with legends such as suzaku (code geass), shinji from fate/stay night and erin(eren?) From aot

**Nana** (18/50)
I've been looking for some Shoujo romance that isn't a reverse harem and/or about high school, and ended up with his show. I must say that it's absolutely amazing, the characters are very relatable and realistic. I'm currently in a very similar position as the main character so I might be a little biased, but the conflicts and issues the main girls encounter into are always very close to reality. 
If you like Shoujo, then please give this show a try!

**Watamote** (4/12)
This show just makes me feel really awkward. I'm not even one of the people that say 'I don't like it because it makes fun of my lifestyle', as I can't *really* identify with Tomoko. Still, watching her social awkwardness went from being kinda funny to me simply pitying her. I'm not sure if I will continue this since I'm not really enjoying it that much, specifically cause she seems to show little to no improvement/character development.

Nana is my favorite romance anime of all time.

Within the past week I finished Nekogami Yaoyorozu and subsequently started Burn-Up W/Excess.

Nekogami Yaoyorozu: Harmless, but pretty forgettable. Haruka Tomatsu's performance was probably the best thing in it.

Burn-Up W/Excess: Not too impressed by W, the scenes were kinda choppy and a lot of the humor felt too artificial. I'm only one episode into Excess, but so far it does seem like an improvement in pretty much every aspect. If they can keep up the same quality for the next 12 episodes, I'll be satisfied.

I don't watch ongoing shows.

Watching a couple of old series, thanks to the Tuesdays recommendation threads.

[Rec](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/rec)
(2006) It's only 9 episodes, and each episode is about 12 minutes in length. It seems pretty obvious that Shaft had a small budget to work with on this romcom, but it's still nicely done. The story revolves around a young voice actress who is try to get her career off the ground. Due to circumstances, she's forced to live with a young salaryman in his flat. It's been a pretty fun watch so far, and the characters have their charm. Great OP song, too.

[Aria the Animation](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/aria-the-animation) (2005) Kind of a slice-of-life mixed with a little sci-fi and fantasy. The show revolves around a group of young girls training to be undines - pilots of gonodolas in an off-world revisioning of Venice. It's mellow, to say the least, and the animation style is showing its age. I'm struggling to get through it so far. There is a lot of overly-saccharine moments, some of which are a bit cringe. I am going to see it through, as I've read that the subsequent seasons are much better, and I really could use a good chill-out show. 
>> ARTICLE
I tried nt gettin into anything so theres only the Toradora! Christmas for me. Excited for that

I got bored in the middle of the week and decided to watch another show I knew nothing about but heard of many times, and this time, it was **A Certain Magical Index**. Went in blind with no expectations, and was/am pleasantly surprised. Didnt know I would be stepping in another pile of haremshit, but thats not a bad thing in my book. Best simple anime equation I could use to describe this show would be *High School DxD* + *The Monogatari Series* - both of which are shows I really liked and am waiting for more of. Can't wait to see what happens in season 2, only a few episodes left of the first.

Just wrapped up Girls und Pander it was much better than I expected. I enjoyed quite enough.

I started watching Katanagatari (ep. 3/12), and my small amount of free time over the weekend was completely consumed by it. Everything about this show is wonderful so far; my only complaint is that the slightly episodic format of "go somewhere, talk a bunch, fight once or twice, get sword" is getting a bit tiresome, especially with 45 minute episodes.

Also, it was a terrible idea on my part to get addicted this show when finals start in a week :(

Nothing at all except 2 eps of one piece :(  I have been a horrible anime watcher since Destiny came out.

I prefer to marathon (or more commonly binge watch) shows.  Perhaps I dislike waiting each week to advance a slow story.  So most of what I've seen, I watched after it finished airing.

Right now, I'm working on the "highest rated*" and "most popular*" shows that I've not yet seen.  With mostly the RomComs and dramas left.

This past week was 

**Toradora**  I was frustrated with the MC for two episodes.  Then the show premise started to make sense.  In most romance stories, the necessary misunderstandings are supported by flimsy circumstances. These bug me because the solutions are obvious, and most could easily be resolved if people just sat down and talked.  The conflicts in this show seem more complicated, and none of the answers are obvious. [The end conflict between ](/s "Taiga and Minori was tough enough to solve.  The sudden fallout with Taiga and Ryuji's families was too much to swallow").  Perhaps between this, Angle Beats, and Golden Time, I'm prepared to tackle Clannad.

Going through Tonari no Seki-kun and was really surprised by how good the ED was.

The song and the animation associated with it are fun. Seeing Seki play on the pencil boxes and what not to the tune of the music is really amusing.

I watched all of Kotoura-san. Not the best anime I've ever watched, but it was a decent and the humor was used in all the right places.
>> ARTICLE
Glad you enjoyed it :). Inaba is my favorite female character of all time.

**Mushishi** *Episode 9* - Slowly making my way through this show. It's very strong, somewhat meditative.  This episode featured a condondrum: If you could make the village harvest prosperous, at the price of one random life, would you take that opportunity? If I was one to marathon a series, or if I had the time, this would be it.  
>> ARTICLE
**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (7/64)** - Started my first legitimate watch of Brotherhood on Thanksgiving Day. I'm loving it so far, and it's bringing so many memories of the original series. I didn't like the events in Lior being simplified into one episode at first, but I got over it quickly.

Also planning to possibly start **Oreimo** on the side, and going to be marathoning the second season of **Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu** next week with a friend
>> ARTICLE
Tamako Market episodes 1-8! 

I saw someone post the OP in a thread somewhere. I thought it was so cute and uplifting. I started watching and it did not disappoint. It's a nice pick-me-up show for whenever I want to be happy :) 
>> ARTICLE
**[Barakamon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon) (12/12)**  
7/10. It was pleasant but not super memorable. But I'd recommend it!

**[Honey and Clover](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16/Hachimitsu_to_Clover) (24/24)**  
6/10. Maybe I'm being a little unfair here since I haven't seen the second season but I just didn't feel like this show was that cohesive. Also Hagu looking half her age was sort of strange. I can definitely see how this would be for some and I actually enjoyed the last 5 or so episodes but the a lot of the parts of this show just didn't feel like they were going anywhere.

**[Nisekoi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18897/Nisekoi) (1-4/20)**  
Really digging this so far, I love the trope of childhood love interest so naturally I'm rooting for Onodera. Plus she's just rad. Bummer that I'm getting into this right as classes start back up but I'm excited.
>> ARTICLE
I finished watching **Steins;Gate** this past week. It was well-paced and very good at introducing and carefully fleshing-out each character without being tedious. I really disliked the voice actors for all the characters though. I thought they were incredibly corny and obnoxious, whether that was intentional or not doesn't really change that.
If I had to rate it, probably 9/10.
>> ARTICLE
[Railgun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6213/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun)

18 Episodes in now. Planning to bust out all of Railgun, the first 9 Episodes of Index, then Railgun S before finishing Index and Index II. I've heard Index isn't as good as Railgun, but I've liked Touma's character thus far in his cameos and think he'll be interesting enough to get through it.

Misaka is totally Best Girl.

I watched **Genshiken Nidaime** a few days ago and it was a lot of fun. I have been a fan of the series for many years but I just never really got around to watching this when it came out last year or reading this part of the manga. Now I really can't wait to buy these volumes and start reading them hopefully sometime next year.

Also can't wait more 2 more weeks and I will probably have (at the very least) a 1 week anime marathon...but hopefully longer.

Glad you enjoyed GBF but I do agree about GBFT. While I am still enjoying it my expectations after the first season were a bit too high and in my opinion it so far doesn't compare to the first season. Still great to watch I do like the new characters and their interactions and am looking forward to how this turns out. 
>> ARTICLE
Watched FLCL **(6/6)**  and **Shin Getter Robo vs. Neo Getter Robo (4/4)**for the first time this week.

Let's just get **SGR v NGR** out of the way first. It had a lot of cool scenes and was very nicely animated. Fights were a bit boring at times, except for the opening which was fantastic. Texas Mack and it's pilots were the funniest things I've ever seen. I'd give it a **7/10** just because it was a bit short and I didn't really feel that attached to the characters. Will be watching New Getter Robo soon.

Now, moving on to **FLCL**... 

Christ on a fucking bike that show was fecking mental and I loved every second of it. It's a coming of age story shrouded in bat-shit insanity, amazing visuals and music. I really enjoyed Naoto's character, as well as Amaroa and Haruko. I found them all charming and I absolutely adored every characters design. This is up there with Kill La Kill for character designs. 

I *LOVE* coming of age stories and I think this show handled it very very well. It might take a while of  reminiscing about the show or maybe a few rewatches to fully understand it, but the more you rewatch it the more things you notice about the characters and it just feels very rewarding when you do find something new. The line about all the adults moving out in the first episode really confused me since Naoto clearly had a dad and grandfather there, so I just assumed it was a translation error. But I was thinking back about the line and suddenly it's meaning struck me. That's the kind of shite I like in anime, things I can think about.

And christ lads, don't get me started on the visuals and music. 'Completely and utterly amazing' is the only phrase I can think of to describe them. Just an absolute pleasure to look at, the fight scenes were very well animated and were accompinied by a fantastic soundtrack. All the different visual stlyes made it very interesting to look at, I especially liked the manga style parts.

Absolutely everything in this show was amazing to me. Definitely in my top 5. Yet another **10/10** for Gainax. Well done lads.

**[Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2605/Sayonara_Zetsubou_Sensei)** (3/12)

I can't even with this show. It's just to different from the things airing this season that's it's a nice cool-down after watching all the airing shows I watch for that day. So far it does not disappoint. However, I didn't know it was a Shaft show until I watched the first episode. That first jumpcut made me check MAL to see if this was Shaft, and sure enough it was. 9/10 cause haven't really seen many shows with pessimistic comedy.

AnoHana  (11/11)- Finished that up earlier this week. I was starting to worry I might actually make it all the way through without any tears, but nope, the last episode officially did it for me.

Tonari no Seki-kun  (12/21)- Really enjoying this one, though I'm slowly watching through since I like saving it for quick doses of pure fun. It's definitely not an anime to take seriously, but I'm really liking that aspect of it. 
>> ARTICLE
**ROD The TV** (Complete): Well, one thing I said about the series is that the premise of weaponizing paper and literature is silly, and it's not hard to mess it up. Well, that's nor ROD. The show pretty much nailed the execution, making for an amazing watch. It does help that it was well-interspersed with focus on the characters too.   
The ending was quite satisfying too, though Joker's fate seems to have been left ambiguous.  
(9.5/10)
[For any Torontonians, you can borrow the OVA/Anime DVD from TPL. You can also stream the anime from Crunchyroll. Though Crunchyroll doesn't carry the dub and the OVA.]

Well, time to start the BluRay rewatch for the Nanoha series. StrikerS being pushed to February is disappointing though.

Just finished Mahouka and I'll probably start reading the LN since they haven't announced a second season. Unlike a lot of anime-only viewers I thought Miyuki was a good character. There are enough scenes with her that you can figure out what she's feeling behind that forced mask of calm. Tatsuya is ridiculous and keeps getting more ridiculous with every episode. I legit felt bad for him by the end of the series though.

**Durarara!! S1**

I remember watching the intro to this show thinking to myself, "Self, this seems very familiar, but I can't for the life of me figure it out."  Then I realized this show is a supernatural twist on a gang war. "Self, this seems like a rip-off of Baccano."  

I was pretty happy to find out that this show and Baccano were created by the same man.  I was even happier to find out that I actually liked this show *more than Baccano*. Herecy, I know.  I had a great time (trying to) follow the story and it got a Season 2 so hype on hype on hype.  ^^Also ^^Celty ^^best ^^girl.

I think that if you can handle an *occasionally* slow plotline, most people would really love this show.

**The iDOLM@STER S1**

I managed to come out of this show liking Makoto and Chihaya on a individual level. I thought their character arcs were pretty cool and had a pretty great amount of development to them and that was enough to make me happy I saw the show in general.  I think the most interesting thing about this show is that it gets you invested in the character's *relationships* more than it does on an individual level.  By episode 25, I was fully invested in Haruka and Chihaya's friendship, I was excited to see Ami and Mami on screen (those two are hilarious) and I thought Iori and Yayoi had a pretty sweet friendship going on too. 

I donno if I would recommend this to most people, but if what I said sounds like a good time to you, go for it.  I had fun.

**Psycho-Pass S1**

Well, I'm ~~Urobutcher~~ Urobuchi fanatic so I'm not sure how much weight my opinion would carry here.  

This show is very good.  I'm a little disappointed in myself for not getting around to it earlier just because I was afraid I'd get caught up in the hype and wouldn't be able to take an objective look at it.

Psycho-Pass is driven by a compelling story told at a break-neck pace, a setting that pulls you in and makes you think and a couple characters that are actually done rather well.  

If you're a Urobuchi fan, I'm sure you'll love this too.  If you don't know who I'm talking about; check it out. It has a very...Ghost in the Shell vibe to it.  I really liked it.

Peace guys! Cya next week and don't forget about the Toradora! (re)watch club that starts Dec. 6th!!

Berserk (1-11/26)- I'm really enjoying it and the opening truly is something special. It is definitely a contender for favorite anime from what I've seen.

I've been re watching Log Horizon but with the english dub. It's kinda meh, but it is growing on me.

**Fafner in the Azure 1-19**: Well, when I read that the sequel will be out this winter, I picked this up again (from the beginning) after dropping it a year or two ago when I struggled to get through the first few episodes. I had judged it to be an inferior Evangelion derivative with little value, but this time around I've enjoyed it much more. Perhaps because it's been longer since I've seen NGE, and I'm comparing the two less?

Fafner has its faults, but it does manage to present a different type of Eva clone where the pilots have good relations with their families (who are their superiors in 'NERV' (Alvis)). It's not as dark or as psychological, and the characters aren't as fucked up, but I'm liking it. Plus, it has an angsty bromance from the beginning instead of punting it to ep24.

[spoilers](/s "At times, Soshi seems gay for Kazuki, especially wanting to 'unite with him' and everything. Just saying. Koyo Kasugai's parents are major dicks, though we're supposed to dislike them. The evil shota Festum in ep8 was kinda adorable. I had a hard time getting through ep10 with all the singing/idol stuff, but the island is supposed to be a peaceful paradise compared to the outside world, after all. I can't stand Maya Tomi's monotone voice - worst casting, IMO.")

[spoilers cont.](/s "The revelations later on -about Festum core toxins preventing conception, so the world chose to destroy Japan along with it- were interesting; I like it when some of the mysteries start to be dealed with. I'm still not sure what they mean by assimilation perhaps being 'good evolution', with the world returning to null and Festum going into a higher dimension.")

[spoilers cont.](/s "However, learning more about the Festum nature and philosophy through Dr. Hino & assimilated Akane was interesting - their collective uniform existence unallowing of 'divergence' is somewhat similar to Instrumentality, though instead of complementation it destroys individuality and unites everyone.")

[spoilers cont.](/s "I certainly wasn't expecting Tatsumiya Island's core girl to be Soshi's little sister. She already gave off Nephilim vibes (Xenosaga) before she started singing, though. I still don't quite understand her thing about 'choices.' I enjoyed their invocation of the Beach Episode mecha trope - swimsuit fanservice! The trial was lulzworthy, though I hadn't expected Mitsuhiro to be Maya's father. Canon is all tsundere.")

I'm looking forward to continuing tonight; I'll probably be able to finish the series, and maybe watch the movies.

**Tokyo Ghoul** (Episodes 12/12)

Really enjoyed it. I think people really overreacted about the censoring. Though I would have preferred to watch it uncensored, the story was still great. I'm kind of bummed by how the first season ended though, as it was kind of a cliffhanger. At least there is a second season that will start airing in January to look forward to.

**Sword Art Online** (Episodes 25/25)

I feel like the first season would have been a lot better if it was more focused on the actual game and action than the romance. Either way though, I still enjoyed it but only when I didn't try to analyze it.

**Bakemonogatari** (Episodes 5/15)

I put this show off for way too long because of not bothering to look up the order in which to watch the series. I regret that. This show really reminds me of FLCL in some way. The animation is different compared to a lot of other anime. I'm looking forward to see what else this show and series in general has in store.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see you're enjoying Bakemonogatari, episode 12 is one of my favorite anime episodes ever and the series on the whole is great.

I finally got around to watching Oreimo after hearing everyone talk about it for so long, and I think it's absolutely lovely. Anyone who, like me, has a casual interest in incest anime should give it a watch.

Also, I saw Princess Mononoke all the way through for the first time, and everyone with a pulse and a shred of aesthetic sensibility should watch that.
>> ARTICLE
**Kaichou wa Maid-sama!** (26/26)

Honestly, the entire series had a similar atmosphere as the one from [Ouran Host Club](http://myanimelist.net/anime/853/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club) . The characters made the show itself. The pacing was steady and the transitions were smooth. I especially loved Usui's myseteriousness throughout the entire series. There are many cheesy scenes, but the humor balances it out. Honestly I wouldn't have minded another season. 8 out of 10!

**Isshuukan Friends** (12/12)

I think this story really brought out feels in a less tearjerking way. You can really imagine yourself in both MCs' shoes. It's quite depressing every 2 episodes or so and although some lines are plain corny and cringy, I felt very attached to the MCs. The ending was a bit lacking; I expected a better resolution, but it was decent enough. 8 out of 10!

**Oreimo** (Season 1 and 2)

Okay. Sibling-love isn't my type of thing, but my friend insisted I watch this. Surprisingly, it was entertaining and fun to watch. I'm not sure if this was a VN, but it sure felt like one. [I especially liked](/s the Ayase route. Too bad the dream's dead. T.T) The overly tsundere sister didn't get enough scenes near the end of season 2 which crushed me on the inside. But putting that aside, the series was simple and easygoing. Before I watched this, I had finished FMA:B so Oreimo was definitely a good buffer. 7/8 out of 10.

**[Mistudomoe](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7627/Mitsudomoe) and [Mitsudomoe Zouryouchuu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9510/Mitsudomoe_Zouryouchuu!). (21/21)**

Man, talk about a perverted series, this series is nothing but sexual innuendos and misunderstandings.  It has running gags that get tiresome after a few times.  Character development of the main characters is extremely slow. BUT! I still enjoyed the series regardless of it all.  Something about the general cluelessness and naivety of kids with the understanding of erotica makes it hilarious to watch.  Sure, the main meat of the series is just gag humor and comedy, but you do get bits of touching drama mixed in for brief periods of time which does act as good breaks/refreshers when you're watching it.

**Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood** (64/64)

Monogatari Second Season (first 4 episodes)

Its taken me forever to even get this far.  I'm one episode short of finishing the Tiger arc, but its just not a strong arc in my opinion.  This happens every time theres a weak arc, i end up stopping the show for a while until i finally finish it.  IMO Araragi and Gahara carry the show, and although i love her arcs i often get bored during arcs that aren't centered around her or the Fire Sisters.  Hopefully the next arc is better.

K-on (first 11 episodes)

I really love this show but i have to watch it in small spurts.  There is such a thing as moe-overload.  Mio is my favorite and they do a very good job of making every girl incredibly lovable.

Finally started Lucky Star. Every scene I find myself bursting out into laughter and thinking I am the exact same as Konata.

**Ghost in the Shell** (Movie 1-2, Finished up SAC 2nd Gig and Solid State Society)

First episode of SAC was literally one of the first anime episodes I ever watched, but it didn't catch my attention so over 2 years later I'm actually getting through it. Not sure why I didn't continue watching it at first, because the show is incredible. Pretty much everyone and their mother has seen it, so not a lot that needs to be said. Looking forward to Arise. 9/10.

**White Album 2** (Complete)

Well. What do you say about WA2. I thought it was a good show with some very well done and likable characters. It started out innocently enough, so I was confused at first about a lot of the reviews I read. It's definitely one of those "great shows I'll probably never watch again" just because of how stressful it was for me to watch. Would definitely watch an anime version of Closing Chapter if it ever happened. 8/10.

**The Idolm@ster** (10-25 + OVA)

Holy f-ing idols. This show is incredible. Idolm@ster's always been on my watch list because I really enjoyed Love Live!, and I finally got around to it knowing another season is getting ready to start airing. I really didn't think Idolm@ster could top Love Live!, but it definitely did. Looking forward to watching the movie here soon. It's pretty rare that you get a series with so many characters who are all awesome, but for the most part, the entire cast was great and it's probably one of my most recent favorites. 10/10 will watch 25 episodes of 765 Pro Idols again (this winter). 
>> ARTICLE
I'm on episode 7 of [Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari) and I'm really enjoying it. I didn't think heavy dialogue would be enjoyable at first but damn it has done everything right so far. The characters all have their own little quirks and are pretty interesting. And this style of animation, idk what its called but all the clips and instantly changing scenes are really cool and well done, puts a nice vibe to the show. Looking forward to watching the entire series!

**Angel Beats**

My second or third anime I watched since getting back into it (coincidentally this past week too.) Definitely had some laughs especially with [kinda spoiler](/s "Noda's 'death' in the Guild as the outro song starts to play, even moreso with the multiple ceiling launches later on") and really, really enjoyed the show. [Other spoilers.](/s "Yui's disappearance and everyone's graduation, especially Kanade's disappearance definitely hit me hard.") I really wish it had been twice as long though, since I wanted to know more about a lot of other characters. I probably would've been perfectly fine if a character or two had an entire episode dedicated to them the way Yui had one just for her.

 This show actually motivated me to start learning piano (whenever I can get a nice digital piano) and learn Japanese (have a Genki book coming in later this week) mainly because those are two things I've been wanting to do for nearly a decade but never got to. The whole message about not having regrets really struck a nerve with me, so I want to work towards not regretting doing those two things. Who knows, maybe sometime in the future I'll be proud of the fact that I can play Ichiban no Takaramono on the piano.

**Another**

Interesting show, first one I watched this week. A bit slow at times and crazy at others, but despite the criticism I see online about it I did like it overall. Sure it had some flaws, but the [plot spoiler](/s "reveal of Reiko being the extra person that was causing all these deaths was pretty well done. I like how the story focused mainly on there being an extra student that the possibility of there being just an extra person in general flew over my head. I also found the subtle hints throughout the show really nice, since they make so much sense after the fact."). I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a little psychological horror.

**Danganronpa**

Knew exactly what I was going to since a friend had me read a let's play about a year ago on Somethingawful, but it was still fun to watch it in anime form. Not too much to say on it though.

**Clannad (not AS)**

Watched this in about a day or two and had fun doing so. Some parts made me happy, some made me sad, pretty much the usual things you might hear about it. Fuko's random appearances were entertaining and I really enjoyed her character overall. I haven't even tried to tackle After Story yet. I don't want to feel crushed so soon after finishing something like Angel Beats. Maybe in a week or so once I get my comedy fix out of the way.

**Watamote**

This show went by way too fast. I put on an episode and before I know it, the ED is playing. This was definitely an awkward show to get through, and I felt awkward for Tomoko. I do share some of her thoughts, thinking too much about situations and ultimately abandoning whatever I was going to do, so I think the creators handled that aspect well. The OP is my favorite of this list and I rarely ever skipped it when watching this show.

**Sword Art Online Season 1**

25 (?) episodes for ~23 minutes each = around 9 and a half hours? Not having paid much attention to it when it showed on Toonami earlier this year, I was determined to watch this front to back and refused to wait until later. Even though this (aside from maybe DBZ) may very well be the epitome of "good guy can't beat bad guy at first, powers up and defeats bad guy eventually," I was not bored with it one bit. I found the romance between Kirito and Asuna amazing and enjoyed that both of them were willing to die just to protect the other. I was rooting for Kirito even more after episode 14, and the second arc definitely knew how to create an antagonist I could hate. Might not be the best anime ever, but it without a doubt holds a special place in my heart. Still need to start SAO 2 though. Eventually.

Typing all this out makes me realize I spent a **lot** of time on anime. I guess finally having free time with a school break does that.

The previous week I barely watched any Anime only watching a couple of episodes of Kaze No Stigma and couple of airing shows (SAOII, Psycho-Pass 2) as I was busy playing Borderlands Pre-Sequel, this last week I binged watched Attack on Titan with watching more Kaze No Stigma.

**Attack On Titan (Dubbed)** (25/25) - No wonder this show is being rerun on Adult Swim in the US and the subbed version being aired here in Australia on SBS2. The animation is top notch and scenes are well executed, the story is excellent. The music/OST is probably the best I have heard since watching Guilty Crown. (It was done by the same guy.) The first OP and ED are also excellent. Be prepared for a lot of blood and on-screen death of various secondary characters (This show got an MA15+ rating in Australia for Strong Animated Violence), No one the MC or his main group meets are safe if you know what I'm saying.  

**Kaze no Stigma (Dubbed)** (Eps 4-12/24) - This show is a bit lackluster in the start but is getting better as the stories start spanning multiple episodes with Kazuma, Ayano and Ren working together. Eg: Misao and the Tsuwabuki arcs which I just finished. I don't like the OP/ED in this show so I get to save 3 minutes per ep by skipping them on Netflix.

This week I watched:

 --Kuroko no Basket (25/25)--

I was pleasantly surprised by this. Its been on my plan to watch for a while because I have heard good things; however, I'm not so interested in basketball and didn't pick it up until a friend did. It's beautifully made and the characters are interesting, but what kept me on the edge of my seat was the journey and the new and powerful opponents that were met. I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried any sports anime; maybe you'll get into it after this. 9/10

--Black Rock Shooter (2-8/8)--
Started this a few weeks ago and was unbelievably bored by it. I wouldn't want to drop a short series like this, so I finished it and was still dissatisfied. Nothing it did was particularly meaningful or touching; I didn't care for the characters or the story. 3/10

--Gintama (1-5/201)--
Can't comment much as I've barely scratched the surface, but I'm in for a ride.
First impressions are that I'll grow to love each character, running gag, and the humor in general for this. Usually the first few episodes for long series' are significantly worse than the rest. If that's the case, then Gintama will be one of my favorites in no time.

--Shinsekai Yori (11-25/25)--
This series wasn't as solid throughout, as I'd hoped for, for me. I was really pumped up after 10 episodes, but my hype plateaued and didn't rise to that next level that I really want. Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing series with awesome music, world building, and art style, but it isn't going to make it into my top ten because of my lack of interest half way through. I'm looking forward to a rewatch, so I can laugh at how naive I am right now. 9/10

--Kuroko no Basket S2 (1-9/25)--
This season has improved character development drastically and has, generally, increased its quality. A very entertaining series.

--Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (2/27)--
Not super impressive, but fun nonetheless. 2 eps isn't much to go on, and mech is my least favorite genre, so this will test my faith in /r/anime, as I hope this is better than Kill la Kill (which I disliked considerably). 

>> ARTICLE
I've just got to episode 11 of Shinsekai Yori and I'm glad it picks up the pace. I think its good, it's just really strangely paced so I'm still not sure what I think of it.
>> ARTICLE
A bit late but still: started and finished watching Highschool DxD, Kill La Kill (watched 5 episodes or so, doesn't seem so good, idk, maybe it's just me), and continued to watch Naruto (hope to finish it all until new year)
>> ARTICLE
Usagi Drop

Beck

Beck was a let down, not in that it was bad but because in my head I was comparing it to things that, IMO, are better than it and in hindsight I wish I had not done that because I would have been able to appreciate it a bit more. I feel like if I had seen this before I'd seen things like Nana or Kids on the Slope, it'd gotten a higher rating as well.

All in all, I ended up giving it a 7 because the art style, voice acting and music were kind of subpar, IMO. The plot was excellent, though so if you are like me and go in thinking that it's not that great, keep watching because while other aspects of it might not be your cup of tea, the plot is for sure unique and refreshing.

I ruined Usagi Drop for myself by reading spoilers about what happens in the manga so I ended up being a little put off about it and could barely finish the series. I ended up giving it an 8/10 and although that seems high, I feel it could have personally been a 10 because of how cute it is.

Very disappointing. :(

Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199.

I remember seeing old episodes of 'Star Blazers' on vhs which my grandparents taped off the TV years ago when my bro and I were very little (there we only saw something like 3 episodes). In searching for more episodes I found the remake of Yamato.

I watched it all in a couple of days (I was off work last week) and its a highly enjoyable show.

**Bakemonogatari**  
Just finished this show and I really look forward to the other seasons, Araragi is so impressive as a character because I kept waiting for his [](/s "vampire powers") to turn into something crazy, but it was never a focus on who he is as a character and I really liked that about the show. It really emphasized the interactions between the characters and had really great dialogue.

There are seriously people that have watched Toradora, NGNL, Kokoro Connect, Nisekoi, Oreimo, Shin Sekai Yori, Golden Time, Angel Beats, Anohana or Clannad AS (different people ofc) this week? ...

**Non Non Byori 1-4**  
So far so slice of life. Having visited rural Taiwan on holiday back in October, I can appreciate the setting and just how remote it is. I liked the candy store episode, and a few moments have made me really chuckle so far, but I'm not quite getting the hype behind it at the moment.

I'm about up to [Episode 25 and I'm not looking forward to it](/s "I really hate watching L and Rem die as they are my favorites...especially L after he just started trusting Light.") The series in general goes way down hill after that episode. Maybe I will feel differently?

So after lasts weeks posts...I am not doing the rating system I said.  I will tag shows that are in my top 10 though.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (12/12):**  Delightful. The ending was a bit strange but I thought it was good.  I feel as though the romance between Rikka and Mokota was really well done, unlike many shows I have seen. The animation was great and the characters really enjoyable.  I enjoyed it immensly.  **I gave Chuunibyou a 9/10.**

**The World God Only Knows S1/S2 (24/24):**  I enjoyed S2 much more than S1.  I felt the conquests had actual romance in them, and all of them were much more fleshed out.  The Haqua arc was also very good.  I also watched the two OVAs you need to after S2 and I am excited for [](/s "his previous conquests to remember him.")  **I gave S1 a 8/10 and S2 a 9/10.**

**Nagi no Asukara (19/26):** Wow is all I have to say.  This show is literally perfect so far.  Hikari is becoming one of my favorite characters ever.  The animation is simply perfect.  The [](/s "timeskip...just lord.  Episode 13 and 14 left me speechless.") I think if it ends strong Nagi no Asukara will be my #2 show of all time. I really hope it does too.

**Nisemonogatari (5/11):** Watched two more episodes.  It appears I have too be in the mood to watch Monogatari for I feel taxed when I finish an episode of it.  Still quality stuff though.  Shinobu is a very interesting character.  

I have been watching more currently airing anime...so that is why my list is a bit short.  

>> ARTICLE
Shinobu is best girl
>> ARTICLE
You're right to be excited for TWGOK S3 - in my opinion, it blows the first two seasons out of the water. Have fun with it!

Just so you know, you've seen most of what you need to, but there *are* some relevant manga arcs that never get covered in the anime. The Tsukiyo Kujy arc (chapters 43-46) and Body Switch arc (81-89) introduce a couple characters who are important for the Goddess arc, and Body Switch in particular is a really fun read. I'd also recommend reading the Mad Scientist arc (109-113) - it's introspective and a little philosophical, and it dives into Keima's psychology in a very interesting way.

Man, ever since I watched True Tears, I've not been able to watch PA works any more. I should've known what I was getting into from the title alone :x. I'll probably try to watch NagiAsu and Glasslip sometime down the line, mostly because they are gorgeous, but I just can't do it right now.
>> ARTICLE
I need to watch True Tears it seems.  And Glasslip so far is...odd.  I don't know where they are going with it honestly.
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no Asukara is one of the best dramas around. I wouldn't say it is... perfect nor flawless (I'm pointing at the lack of explanations on how Ena actually works and how they can breath underwater), but it is really good. It touches some things other than romance, and I always like that.
>> ARTICLE
I have not finished it yet.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I didn't spoil anything. They don't explain anything else about Ena, so... Well, anyway, it is a good show till the very end.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed Nagi no Asukara but the ending seemed a little disappointing to me.  I felt like we developed the characters extremely well, but the implied ending makes me feel like a lot of that development was thrown out the window.
>> ARTICLE
Alright I just finished it, how do you feel as though the development was thrown out?
>> ARTICLE
[Its implied that Manaka and Hikari are together end of the show.  Basically, i felt that through all of his development, he had grown past his childhood crush, and would choose the girl who was strong and was always there for him, Miuna.  But instead, he chooses the damsel in distress who feels much less developed as a person, and to me, represents the immature Hikari that we see in episode 1.](/spoiler)  But that's just my opinion.

**Code Geass Episode 1-50**

I took this last week to burn through all of Code Geass. I wasn't really planning on it, it just sort of happened. Those bastards knew how to put the perfect cliff hangers at the end of each episode to motivate you onto the next one.

I think the first half was pretty well put together, and the way that everything sort of lead up to the finale was really engaging and well executed. They're able to make the show feel big, but at the same time they're able to make it small and isolate Lelouch (particularly at the end of the second season). I also like how the show actually challenged him. I came in thinking he would be a genius who just wins everything with his brilliance, which is certainly *how* he wins, he just doesn't always win.

Speaking of the second season, that was a bit of a letdown. A lot of the shit that happens seemed to come out of fucking nowhere. The things that didn't come out of nowhere just sort of happened. There wasn't anything gained, or learned, or explored. Lelouch just wins a thing and that's the end. I know the first season was also entirely plot driven, but I just wish this season were executed as well as the first. They certainly created a lot of different threads. There was paying for your sins, reason for living, and several others I forgot because my memory sucks. Despite that, I did think the ending was pretty well done. I kind of like how the show leaves you in the dark as to what Lelouch is planning until [CG ending spoilers](/s "he's pretty much dead"). 

Even though I problems with the second season, I enjoyed the show quite a bit. High quality popcorn that's over the top in all of the right ways. Well, most of the right ways. Only Jojo's is over the top in all of the right ways. Araki is a fucking genius.

**Mahou Shoujo MadokaMagica - 12/12:** Finished this after I started it 2 weeks ago. Interesting show, not as dark as I expected to be but still pretty good - 8/10.

**Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. - 13/13:** Had to watch this before the sequel airs and I ended up binge watching it. It has a setting bit similar to your generic romcom show but this was way different and awesome in it's own way and I just love Hachiman - 9/10.

**Death Billiards:** Catching up with the Anime Mirai projects so had to watch this too. I'm still a bit confused on who went where but the idea still was interesting - 8/10.

**Plastic Nee-san - 12/12:** Wanted to watch this for quite some time and finally got to it. I was grinning for the majority of the series, damn that was crazy - 8/10.

**School Days - 12/12:** Seen this recommended all over the place and had to watch it. I kinda expected the ending since I got spoiled by the NouCome OVA's ending but still had a good laugh when it happened - 7/10.

**Daily Lives of High School Boys - 12/12:** One of the better comedies that I've seen and it has quite a number of references - 8/10.

**Serial Experiments Lain - 1/13:** Creepy and weird for a first episode. I don't know how this found it's way to my Plan to Watch list but it sure is damn interesting.

Yeah, Hikari tackled the issue the wrong way and just made her seem a lot more stupid. I still think that the way Kotonoha and Sekai got treated was pretty bad but Sekai shouldn't have trusted someone who was willing to cheat on his girlfriend with her.

When did it hook you? I currently have it on-hold at episode 4, and I'm having a hard time finding the motivation to keep watching.

I'd say it hooked me around episode 7. That was the only part i didn't really care for in the series was how it started out slow, but it really picked up and past around episode 13-14 i couldn't stop watching.

Just finished A certain Scientific Railgun, starting A certain Magical Index. Railgun was pretty good though I had to skip a lot of the SoL episodes in the middle of the season. This show was best when it was being serious and felt boring when it tried to head towards the SoL areas.

All I can say is Misaka better win. That may be due to my bias towards Tsunderes though. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt exactly the opposite about Railgun. The SoL was fun, but the actual plot was standard shounen fighting stuff that does nothing for me.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed Railgun a whole lot more when I looked at it as a SoL set in the "Index" world, rather than a side story to the faster paced A Certain Magical Index. That said I still hope Railgun S focuses more on the plot and expands on the world, because there's more than enough shows out there for my SoL fix.

PLANETES!!!!!!!! It was absolutely amazing 10/10 for me. Its like space future slice of life with no stupid highschool shit in sight. Its episodic feel was reminiscent of bebop and i can say i reallly enjoyed the whole thing

**Black Lagoon** (12/12)

The first thing that I noticed about this series was its striking resemblance to Cowboy Bebop. Dutch reminded me of Jet, Revy was like an extremely foul tempered Spike, Benny was the computer guy like Ed, and Rock definitely borrowed a few small things from Faye. Both casts also have similar jobs. Other than that, it really did stand on its own as an awesome show. It plays out like an American summer action movie, but it's also rather more intelligent and has more depth than those kinds of movies. For example, you have scenes where Revy will annihilate a small army singlehandedly without getting a scratch, but you also have scenes that develop her character well. My favorite scene in the whole show is when [spoiler](/s "Rock stands up to Revy like badass and almost getting killed in the process.") I can't remember another confrontation between two characters that got my adrenaline going like that since Breaking Bad. All in all, Black Lagoon was a hell of a good watch, and I look forward to watching The Second Barrage. 9 outta 10



**Nichijou** (26/26)


Finally finished it! Nichijou completely forced itself into my Top 5 favorite anime. It was such a fun show. I loved nearly every minute of it, and I didn't want it to end. Nonetheless, it wrapped up with a happy little bow, leaving me extremely satisfied with the ending. On top of that, it also mamaged to break me out of an artistic funk I've been in for a long time, and I'll always be grateful for that. 10 outta 10.
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou was extremely well made. And exactly my type of humor. Sadly not many people like the extreme absurdity and we will never get season 2. At least the manga is being translated again, going into chapters that weren't in the anime.

You should watch Azumanga Daioh.

**Kimi ni Todoke Season 1 episodes 1-25 (Complete):**

It took me roughly 72 hours to cover 22 episodes. That might sound to you like great, but last week I've watched 12 episodes of Sukitte Ii na yo. in one day, and 3 hours is how long it took me to get through Chihayafuru's 51 episodes, more or less.

Let's backtrack a bit. [Last week I wrote about Sukitte Ii na yo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2b91do/what_have_yall_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cj2yiz3), a show that's not the best, but which I found enjoyable, and liked. Kimi ni Todoke had been a bit more of a slog, and I keep finding myself alt-tabbing and checking twitter, while I *almost* marathon it.

Many aspects are shared between the two shows, and some aspects I've argued for as being solid in Sukitte were things I have a hard time enjoying in Kimi ni Todoke. This is a frustrating experience that's a chance for some intense analysis. Why do I like this one show, but not that other show, even as they are so similar? One could even look at two video games that seem almost identical, and yet one you enjoy, and the other you don't.

Often the answer is something minor and hard to quantify which shapes the experience, such as "controls" in a game, or in the case of these two shows, the most pervasive issue is the *pacing*. Kimi ni Todoke has 25 episodes. Cutting the OP and ED, they're roughly 1 minute shorter than standard episode length, and yet we've had a recap episode, and quite a few episodes open with a minute or so of showing how the last one ended.

This show should have *really* been a third shorter, if not a full half. When we resolved the "conflict" at the end of episode 15, I felt the series should've hit this mark at the 6th episode, or the 8th at most.

Before we delve into the meat of the problems *beyond* pacing, let's talk for a tiny bit about the production values, so we could get them out of the way - the actors are solid, Sawashiro Miyuki and Sanpei Yuuko as the best friends, and Hirano Aya as the rival in particular. I've never been a big fan of Noto Yamiko who portrays Sawako, our main character, and this show is no exception, but considering how little impact she has, it doesn't matter as much, but we'll get to it later, again.

I quipped last week that a single episode of Free! for instance has more animation in a single episode than Sukitte Ii na yo had in its full 14 episodes. Sukitte Ii na yo probably had in half a season as much animation as the all 25 episodes of Kimi ni Todoke's first season. It also doesn't have the lush and beautiful backgrounds, and instead gives us super-deformed manga-style (more like "Drawing with one's weak hand omake"-style, coupled with a lot of silly almost gags.

And that's where tie it all together. The show has a lot of still moments. Not just still shots where people don't move and talk to one another, but where people stand stock still and look at the other, or freeze and digest everything. That sort of thing is very much a standard thing in shoujo romances, but here they feel both more frequent, and longer, and actually *replace* any sort of real "happening".

I suspect I'd have enjoyed this show more if I'd read it as a manga. It helps that I'm a really fast reader. But when nothing happens, it takes you a few seconds to digest and you move on, even if you stare at each shot of people staring at one another. But here, it was hard to maintain my attention when I keep watching *nothing* unfold before my eyes. All these moments, even as I chuckle, showcase there's nothing underneath to provide adequate support. So I'd have enjoyed it more, powering through to actually see "stuff happen", but what about said stuff?

Sukitte Ii na yo and Kimi ni Todoke have a similar setup - a girl with no friends, slowly learning to form connections. But whereas Sukitte's tension comes from constructing connections, and how difficult it truly is to extend your reach, it feels as if Kimi ni Todoke contents itself with being trapped inside one's head. The "romantic interest" is as "non-character" as it gets, he's essentially a "McGuffin" one tries to obtain or a wise old man who gives us support now and then, rather than a character that feels "real". We mostly see the girls talking about their feelings, talking about talking, and feeling about feeling, rather than actually going out there into the world, to change things, and be changed. Unlike Sukitte ii na yo where the MC more or less fit these clauses as well though, there's no one else who's pushing for change here, no happening that force people to reflect and change.

These are the same issues all shoujo deal with, but it feels the show is more in love with the concepts, more in love with the concept of love, than actually being willing to tackle it, than actually being willing to force the characters to tackle with other characters. Yes, Sawako doesn't know how things work out, but even as the series is nearing its end, the level of discourse she engages on feels the sort you'd expect from a 6 years old child discussing "adult relationships" than someone who truly went through changes and is trying to integrate into society themselves. "Sophomoric" would be high-praise for what we're getting here. Yes, we can chuckle at Sawako's misunderstandings, but that level of "hee hee" does not carry a romantic series that's 25 episodes long.

This show did have two bits that rose above the mediocrity of everything else. Kurumi, the rival, and Chizuru's crush. Kurumi's bit was a bit too long and drawn out, and much of it was carried out by seeing characters cry, and Aya Hirano's voice transmitting the level of emotions, but there was still actual conflict here, one that wasn't magically resolved. Understanding that deepened the conflict, respect that fueled a rivalry. The lines uttered here were terrible, such as "I always worked hard to make sure he didn't find a girlfriend!" but I actually bought them.

Chizuru's mini-arc was short, and again fueled by tears. But it felt like a solid piece of drama. You know what it reminds me of, when one's story is more of a vehicle to tell the sob-stories of side-characters that are the *truly* interesting ones? Fruits Basket. But there we've had a lot such stories, and we kept moving from one to the next, with considerably less time spent on "nothingness". Also, I've only read the manga, so no idea how the series (which is half anime-original anyway) did.

Kimi ni Todoke isn't bad, but it's dull, and I find my attention wandering. I can't really give it more than 5.6/10 in good conscience, and even that is due to Chizuru's arc. The last few episodes were all sort of sweet nothingness, but still felt overly drawn out.

P.S. They keep writing "If I was" and it's driving me bonkers. Subjunctive, what is?

---

I've also watched a couple of episodes of **Ergo Proxy** (10-11), but a migraine stopped me. It was definitely interesting, and trippy, and though provoking, and more than a tad pretentious. Episode 11... I could've probably written thousands of words about it, but I stopped myself.
>> ARTICLE
I liked Kimi ni Todoke even though I normally can't stand shoujo. The main guy wasn't a giant unlikable twat like in most shoujos, and the main girl wasn't a standard shoujo heroine (aka wannabe strong independent woman who don't need no man, until of course she's in trouble, then only the main guy can help her) but instead she's one big blob of adorableness.

###**Puella Magi Madoka Magica**

**Episode 8 - 12**

So first I'm going to just open up with a transcription of my tweets during watching Madoka, that sort of show the progression of my impression of this animation production.  

- ["I'm beginning to appreciate Madoka more, as she seems to be getting more and more in focus #meguca"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtCWZT-CYAAVjnu.png) 

- "I'm not sure I understand Kyouko yet, which means any complaints about her may be undermined by lack of knowledge. [...] Like, I still haven't wrapped my head around how she can be concerned for Madoka losing her best friend when there is implied she's let [...] dozens of people die on purpose, just to produce Grief Seeds and fuel her power. Was that all a front? Or did Sayaka actually make her more [...] empathetic towards people? [...] It doesn't help that I still contend that her backstory was introduced too quickly and lacked impact because it was "told""

- ["Greatest comedy ever #meguca"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtLl_O9IQAAxgw9.png)

- "Oh, so NOW all the Sayaka x Kyouko shipping makes sense #meguca"

- ["Oh man the Kalafina ED is playing in the background. Shits bout go down sonnn #meguca"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtRplnjIIAACwWP.png)

- "This "threads of fate" kinda ruins that idea I had of Madoka as "an ordinary man doing extraordinary things, that an NPC can be a hero too""

- "Ok, goddamit Madoka, why do you have to make me like you so much now after I trashed you so much before."

- *Episode 12 happened...*

- "Holy shit Madoka. I'm just grinning from ear to ear - that was a great ending."

- "So much bookending. All that optimism. Such tight writing. THAT DIRECTION. Goddamn."

- "I still have some misgivings about the early sections and with Kyouko, but that was a tremendously well directed second half."

- ["Given what I know about Rebellion, these wings seem ominous... #meguca_12"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtSO0wtIgAAxDNj.png)

In hindsight, I realize Madoka is a very brave girl, and she's made me think about what I'd be willing to do to protect those I've loved, even those I've never met. Would I be able to become an aegis of hope? A bulwark against the shadows of the world, an eternal ray of light to pierce the darkness of life? I don't know; I doubt I'll ever know. 

Me saying that Madoka was a brave girl seems odd, eh? I mean, in my other posts, I've said that I thought she was a boring, passive character and that she felt more like side-character material. But /u/q_3 and /u/ClearandSweet said some things last week that I don't think understood until now. Specifically, said that /u/q_3 Madoka was a very *reactive* character, not passive, and while I wasn't sure whether I agreed with that sentiment before, I think I agree with it now. Furthermore, both /u/q_3 and /u/ClearandSweet said that the narrative was sort of "constraining" Madoka from acting on her own, and I think it was this fact that was partly what was bothering me about Madoka.

When Madoka finally took in *all* the facts, after her mother asked her if she was being deceived and she was finally sure of herself, that Madoka finally made a choice. And it was that choice that made the ending for me. In a show where every character's hand was forced by the vagaries of fate, to make a sacrifice they weren't always ready for, Madoka was empowered to make a great choice in their place. And she chose to sacrifice herself - not others; she was given the option of backing out. But she chose it, willingly, after every option was presented to her, when all the knowledge that was withheld, was exposed. 

And I think that's a really powerful idea - of choosing to willingly sacrifice oneself for the benefit of others. A lot of anime depict self-sacrifice, but few of them felt as weighty, as magnificent, or as meaningful as Madoka's sacrifice (the grand scale of it helps). For me, I think that has partly to do with my ideas of the sacrifices for utilitarianism. It's often quoted that "To make an omelet, you have to crack a few eggs." Plenty of people have spilled words about how Madoka demonstrates utilitarianism through Kyubey and the Incubators, so I'm not going to bother proving it. But something I've always believed is that the sacrifices that need to be made for the betterment of humanity, needs to be made by those willing to take that burden, after all information is given to them. After Sayaka, Kyouko, Mami and the countless other mahou shoujo before them sacrificed themselves, I think Madoka's is the first "just" sacrifice the show made.

Gripes and asides:

- I still stand by the belief that Kyouko's backstory was rushed and didn't have as much impact on the audience as it should've, in order to make her change in behavior feel more natural.

- I wanted some more backstory from Homura. I could infer, based on how it goes in anime, that girls like past!Homura didn't have a lot of friends, which is why she was so attached to Madoka. I would've preferred some elaboration on her past, though. It obviously wasn't necessary to the flow of the show, but I still would've liked it.

- Why was Kyubey surprised that Homura had time powers in the alternate timelines? His race gave her time powers, shouldn't they be able to monitor who can time travel?

- I thought it was cool how the OP was revealed to be about Homura. Furthermore, there was one line in the OP, ["the beautiful blue sky will always be waiting for me"](http://i.imgur.com/YdKCSyJ.png) that gained a lot of relevance once Madoka defeated Walpurgisnacht and dispelled the miasma -

###**Penguindrum**

**Episode 14-15**

I decided to re-open the *Penguindrum* casebook. As one who's watched the show can guess, taking a 4 month hiatus from this show, and then jumping right where you left off, can leave one slightly...confused. Thankfully, because of [the great *Penguindrum* posts that were on Altair & Vega](http://altairandvega.net/?s=Penguindrum+14) that some of you kind gentlemen linked me to many moons ago (and which I was surprised to find our own dear /u/supicasupica apparently contributed to!), I managed to get back up to speed (roughly; a little wiki-ing here and there but no big deal.)

I largely skipped notes on episode 14 while I tried to re-orient myself, but I got some stuff down for episode 15. 

Penguindrum 15:

I dunno how to say this, but...this episode of Penguindrum is making me kind of uncomfortable. I mean, there's a lot of cruelty in the world of Penguindrum, but this is getting just...I dunno. I don't think it's using sexual assault/rape/abuse lightly, and it's certainly consistent in it's depiction of the way abuse cycles through families. So, it is interesting, in a twisted sort of way. I'm also finding it hard to see any personal truth in Sanetoshi's statements about family, but I can thank a supportive family for that; they're the kind of family I'd choose to be a part of. 

MAYBE PENGUINDRUM IS ACTUALY AN ALLEGORY FOR COMPETING GROUPS FIGHTING OVER LIMITED RESOURCES, REFLECTING HUMANITIES IMPENDING RESOURCE WARS. No, but actually, with the revelation that the diary can change fate (I'm assuming it actually *can* do that, or at least the characters genuinely believe it can), it means that there a supple of "hope" for the characters...but it is a finite resource. Few of the characters seem to care that the other actors in this play are also in shitty situations, and that they ALL need the diary, all to save someone precious...or save themselves. There is no sympathy, there is only a resource and those who need it. Those with information on the other have power, those who are armed have power. Deception is key, espionage is vital. 

It truly is a war. And what's so lovely about the role of Momoka is that, when she had the diary, she gave it away freely. She shared. She provided foreign aid relief and sent her fleets of hospital ships to help the wounded. 
And she did it because she had so much - she was "rich". She had the budget for it. ~~She's like the United States, except not a dick~~

Well it is said that magic girls defy all currently known laws and that they contradict reality as understood hence their ability to resist entropy. Given this knowledge and the ability to make a wish that defies reality, it is very likely that they can't monitor this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. That actually makes a certain kind of sense. I guess, then, you could even extract some statements about meddling with what you don't know (if we take your statement to be true, the Incubators are far less in control of the situation than we were led to believe.)

I think for Kyuubei being surprised about Homura's magic is because she wasn't created by the Incubators and had come from outside the timeline, appearing before her original transformation date meaning they had no information on her. 

The Incubators probably didn't need the ability to detect what the powers of the girls would be so didn't develop a way of reading anything but the amount of energy the girls would provide.

Ended up being surprisingly busy this week, so I only sat down to watch anything once. Ended up pussying out on H2O once again (I know I'll have to watch it eventually, just not this week), so instead I decided to watch something else.

**Samurai Flamenco (2-7):**

Okay, how about I divide this into two small, separate sections, both of them giving a very brief summary of my impression of the show at the time I had watched the episodes in question:

**Episodes 2-6, plus all of 7 except the last few minutes**

This show is honestly kind of interesting, taking an overall more "realistic" approach to the whole situations. No superpowers, no supervillains, just a model who is chasing his childhood dream of being a superhero, and succeeding quite well all things considered. The characters are all at least a little bit interesting or funny, and I can't honestly say that I truly dislike any of them. Maybe not feel too fondly for, sure, but none are bad enough that I can't find something I like about them.

**Last few minutes of episode 7**

...I'll just quote my Skype log to a friend for this.

[Skype](/s "What the fuck just happened")

[](/s "What the fuck just happened")

[](/s "WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?!")

[](/s "That's it, fuck this shit, I'm going to bed")

[](/s "I've been sufficiently Madoka'd for the night")

Quite literally, I have no idea how to take those last few minutes. It was so sudden I don't even know what to say, really. Maybe when I watch more later I'll know how I really feel, but for now I'm just gonna sit here and stare into the wall some more.
>> ARTICLE
I've actually been clean of anime for a couple of months until recently, where I've found myself binge-watching quite a few number of anime this past week.
 
**Neon Genesis Evangelion** *(26/26)* - I have to start by saying that this anime has one of the best openers ever, period - simply because of the awesome song. This anime had been on my list forever and I had always been skeptical about it. I have to say that I felt that this anime was ahead of its time. If I had to describe it I'd have to say that it was a psychological anime hidden in mecha. It's deeply polarizing with a great range of characters. I can't honestly say I understood everything the anime was trying to convey but for now, I got the gist of it. Everything is presented in a brutal and honest manner. The ending may seem a bit farfetched and odd at first but I think if you read between the lines hard enough you'll find the finer points to it. I took on the liberty of watching the sequel film as well, "The End of Evangelion" and it's definitely a must-watch follow-up as it attempts to wrap up everything. Personally this one hit home for me and I was conflicted as whether to give it a 10 or not. I am definitely going to re-watch it when I have the time as well and I have yet to watch the Rebuild movies but I will in the near future. **9/10**

**Psycho-Pass** *(22/22)* - I remember catching a glimpse of this anime's existence last year but never took any real interest. Boy was that a mistake!  It's not your typical action/sci-fi/police anime. It was very thought-provoking and had some compelling themes. It's very plot driven and has great character development for the main characters. In my books this is a very solid anime and not to be missed, looking forward to the next season. **9/10**

**KILL la KILL** *(24/24)* - I actually watched just the first half last year when it was airing but have just gone back to finish the latter half of it. To be honest I struggled to continue watching it several times because it just wasn't as entertaining as I thought it'd be. However, I promised to write this one off my list as I tend to finish all anime that I start and I'm glad I did. I found that all I needed to do was just not take it too seriously and just enjoy the ride, though the last half did seem to have a lot more plot to it (albeit a bit rushed). A lot of fanservice was what I didn't like too much  but I loved Mako :). I'd say this one ran it home in the end and it was pretty well done. **8/10**

**Danganronpa - The Animation** *(13/13)* - This ones been on my list for awhile as well since it started airing, it peaked my interest at first when my favourite subbing group (UTW - RIP 2014) picked it up. I think it had A LOT of potential, this reminded me a lot of Phoenix Wright in a sense that there was trials and evidence/clues. However, the main complaint was that it was only 13 episodes long and should have been 24-26 as there was little to no room for any detail or character development (or of anything). It tried to wrap it up quickly also (as do most short anime do) and gave us an out-of-the-box sort of resolution to everything. I appreciate it for what it was and what it could have been, slightly higher rating perhaps than it should be. **7/10**

**Hitsugi no Chaika** *(12/12)* - Honestly, I only knew this existed through Tumblr gifs of the girl, Chaika. I went into it without too much expectations and what I got was a fairly enjoyable but mediocre anime. That being said, I'm a slight fan when it comes to action/adventure/fantasy. It had a pretty solid main plot with some limited characters and some mystery to it by the end. There was a dose of originality to it with thrown in comedy here and there, I think this one was slightly overlooked by many and deserves more eyes, expecting more from the next season. **8/10**

**Another** *(12/12)* - I knew about this anime for awhile now and finally just got around to it. I think my expectations kind of ruined it for me. I usually don't have much expectations but when it comes to horror/mystery I genuinely want to be scared/intrigued -  I think it did the intrigue thing well for a good part of it. It was a little creepy at first and very mysterious. However, it doesn't give us an definitive answer as to why things happen the way they did and just tells us that they do. Although I did find it enjoyable as the plot kept me interested enough to watch in one sitting and kept me guessing till the very end. I think it's worth a watch if you are a fan of the genre, as it should keep you guessing all the way through. **8/10**

**No Game No Life** *(12/12)* - Not sure if I'm allowed to say anything about this one but it already finished airing so I'll keep it short. I recently checked this one out due to its popularity, I am definitely a fan of the theme in this anime but there was a little too much ecchi for my liking. The fanservice was basically shoved into your face whether you liked it or not. However, I was able to look past it and did find myself a rather enjoyable anime, just don't take it too seriously. **8/10**

**Devil May Cry** *(12/12)* - Checked this one out for giggles. Featuring our one and only Dante, being a fan of DMC this one was on my list for a long time as well. At its core, it's a very basic anime with not much development and no plot. There was one episode that caught my eye with Dante's past late into the series but other than that the rest is just about pizzas and strawberry sundaes! You'll enjoy it if you like Dante and a kind of slice of life type series. **7/10**

P.S. I hope you enjoyed reading my mini-reviews and be sure to recommend me any anime if you have time <3

> Hitsugi no Chaika 

2nd season this fall (or rather, the 2nd half of the show)

I also recommend checking out it's big sister **Scrapped Princess**. Same author, director, and studio combo, as well as a similar starting premise (and a similar naming scheme, all the characters are named after guns). Goes in a wildly different direction though and I think its the better, more ambitious work of the 2 even if there is a bit less action.

I don't know if you've seen it but since you liked Evangelion & Psycho-Pass so much, I think you should give **Texhnolyze** a look. Very dark dystopia with heavy themes. It's a slow show, but the final few episodes remind me of EoE and the Twilight Zone with how everything just went straight to shit. I think it's worth checking out.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved Scrapped Princess.  I'm not a big anime watcher and I occasionally watch a series here and there every year or two, but I just adore Scrapped Princess.  It was one of the earlier anime that I watched and I loved the brother and sister pair that protected her.  I was really disappointed when I looked up the reviews/reception to the anime a couple of years after watching it and seeing how many people disliked it.  I thought it was great and never found other people who enjoyed it as much as I did.

I am a sucker for the fantasy/action anime though, so I'm not a "true" anime watcher.  I feel weird reading some of these threads because a lot of the anime people hate I seem to enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I adore it too! Easily my favorite action fantasy show, while there are certainly 'better' shows, this one is one of my favorites. It also created my favorite setting in all of anime, and the characters were all so lovable.

Thank you kindly for the recommendations! They tick all of my genre boxes, will be checking them out in the future :)

**Hamatora** (the first season). It wasn't bad but also nothing special.

**Sengoko Basara (S1)**. This was awful. The anime failed to get me interested on any character or in the plot which was all over the place. Not even glorious Wakamoto saved it.

**Kidou Senkan Nadesico**. This anime. This anime had all the plot elements to be amazing. But they decided to go with comedy and parody instead. Just awful to watch. ;_;

I also watched **WIXOSS** and **Ping Pong the Animation** but apparently those don't count even though they already ended ;_;

> apparently those don't count even though they already ended ;_;

/u/cptn_garlock probably just needs to update that text with current season examples.
>> ARTICLE
You would be right. Confession: I actually use that text as a covert means to push my ideas of what was good this and last season; consider it my personal recommendations. This is the first one where I had two equally phenomenal shows from the previous season, so expect *Ping Pong the Animation* and *Mushishi Zoku Shou* to be there. Unfortunately, no new show has gotten even remotely good as either of those yet, so I don't know what to mark down for current season.
>> ARTICLE
**Gintama** (37-42/201) - A very solid set of episodes and the first three-part story featuring Kagura and her father, which improved my opinion of her by quite a bit. My new favorite episode was right before that though, with Katsura and Ikumatsu. As long as the show keeps up with the quality it finally reached here, I'll be happy watching it for quite some time. Longer post in the [Gintama discussion thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2bs66f/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_3742/cj8dig4).

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (9/64) - Winry! I like Winry. And Maes Hughes too. Dont like the cartoonish style as much though. Judging by the description of the tenth episode on Netflix I'm suspecting one of my least favorite episodes is next.

**Fate/Zero** (1/24) - I finally finished the Fate/Stay Night visual novel last night (close to 60 hours) and immediately dove into this. I realized right away that I made the correct decision to take my time and read the VN first as many people suggested.

While the outcome of the war detailed in Fate/Zero is a foregone conclusion as it's a prequel, the first ten minutes of the first episode here spoil several massive character/plot points from F/SN. [F/SN](/s "Seeing the bugs swarming over the young Sakura was rough.") Its hard to tell because Im already familiar with the setting, but it seems like they do a good job of setting up the rules of the Holy Grail War and its major players early on even for newcomers to the series. Saber asking at the end if Kiritsugu is her master in the same tone as she later does with Shirou made me happy.

~~I'm already really looking forward to the new Fate/Stay Night adaptation in the fall regardless of what route they take.~~ Turns out that the series will be [Unlimited Blade Works](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2buja3/fatestay_night_unlimited_blade_works_confirmed/) and [Heaven's Feel](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2bum5b/rejoice_heavens_feel_also_confirmed_hype_hype_hype/) is getting a movie. I'm on board with both.
>> ARTICLE
Yay I'm so happy you experienced Fate the correct way :P. I actually really liked the first episode of Fate/Zero from a VN readers perspective. I think it's funny that all the newcomers hate it.
>> ARTICLE
It felt right at home for me, but after thinking about it I can definitely see where someone new to the series would be put off by it.
>> ARTICLE
So what did you think of the F/SN visual novel?
>> ARTICLE
Didn't plan on talking about it much since it's not an anime series and I don't frequent /r/visualnovels enough to comment there, but here goes:

I was biased toward Saber from the moment she spoke since her voice actress was also behind a couple of my favorite characters in other series, but even so I really liked the character and the decision to become a heroic servant that she had to struggle with throughout the story. [F/SN Fate](/s "Arturia, rather than Arthur, was a nice twist. I was having difficulty thinking of heroic female knights aside from Joan of Arc who remained my top suspect for her identity before the Excalibur reveal.")

Shirou was dense as to be expected with most main characters, but improved throughout the story. [F/SN Unlimited Blade Works](/s "I started to suspect that he was Archer even early on in the UBW route but dismissed it because I didn't think both forms of him would be allowed to exist simultaneously. Guess the Grail doesn't care. It lead to several awesome battles though and hinted at his potential fate if he made a few incorrect choices.")

Rin was just kinda awesome overall. Not a lot to say about her though. Yay tsunderes? [F/SN Unlimited Blade Works](/s "I kinda wish the good and true endings to her route were swapped though, I'd much rather see Saber hang around with both of them.")

Sakura... oh, Sakura. I was *not* prepared for that route. [F/SN Heaven's Feel](/s "In retrospect I felt terrible for neglecting her in the other routes. I don't want to know what happened to her in those. I knew Shinji was physically abusing her but didn't see it going that far, and the majority of the route just made me feel uncomfortable as I kept digging up more horrible secrets from her past. Everything just goes to hell in this route.")

[F/SN all routes](/s "Similarly with Kotomine Kirei, I found him suspicious but didn't expect Gilgamesh to still be hanging around. I spent the remaining arcs hating both of their guts and of course they're the big bads for all three of them aside from the Grail itself. I don't think the idea of a contaminated Holy Grail is anything new, but I like their take on it. Illya was an interesting reversal who I liked progressively more as I advanced through the different routes.")

That's about all I can think of right now without doing a full write-up. Overall I really enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to digging into the related works. Weird side note: for some reason I thought it was a mecha series and thus quickly dismissed it up until about a month ago. I have no idea where that impression came from.
>> ARTICLE
> it seems like they do a good job of setting up the rules of the Holy Grail War and its major players early on even for newcomers to the series

As someone who has little interest in the series but was persuaded to try the first episode, I'd say not. Using a double length first episode for exposition was utterly tedious and totally unengaging, so I didn't remember any of it and couldn't be bothered to suffer through another episode.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. I actually started writing that before I finished the episode and it did end up dragging on more than I expected. I like figuring out the mechanics of new settings so it fits right in a happy spot in my mind, but I can see where other people would not find it interesting.

I've been watching Jojo part 1 since Stardust Crusaders got me interested in the whole Jojo franchise.

Out of all the Joestar men, Joseph has been the most entertaining. I'm up to episode 9 and Jonathan has been alright so far. He's not dull but he's not nearly as entertaining as Joseph.

Phantom Blood hasn't been as fun as Stardust Crusaders but seeing the rise of Dio is pretty interesting.

Overall it's been an outstanding week for me, I've started/finished/continued watching some stuff that have been 9/10s, and I've started another that's pretty good but I think it has potential.

Finished **Nichijou** and I'm sad that it's over, I'm craving more. It was a very funny series and has become one of my favourites, I loved the animation and all of the characters personalities/quirks/mannerisms. My only complaint is that it was hit or miss at times, still 8-9/10. 

Watched episodes 6-14 of **Cowboy Bebop**, and so far it's been everything I've expected it to be and more. Normally I can't deal with episodic shows and I drop them fairly early, but Bebop has been different. I'm watching the dub and it's easily one of the best I've ever seen. Cool characters, interesting stories, great music, and great atmosphere. I have no major gripes with the show, it's at least a 9/10 so far.

Episodes 1-4 of **The Tatami Galaxy**. It's been... Interesting. I'm not sure I know what's going on and it can be hard to keep up with the subtitles and ridiculous pace, but it's pretty good. I'm interested in seeing where the show is going, the "kinda repeating stuff but kinda not" is cool and I think it has some potential. It's pretty funny at times and I love the visuals, 7-8/10.

Episodes 1-8 of **Katanagatari**. It's been a great experience so far, and I really don't have many issues with it. I love the dialogue, characters, art, and plot. I wasn't a big fan of the early episodes but it's quickly grown on me, 9/10.
>> ARTICLE
First time doing this, but I'd say I watched a lot this week.

**D-Frag!** (12/12): This show is hilarious and I just hated how it ended so fast. **8/10** 

**Elfen Lied Special** (1/1): I didn't even know they had this. Watched it out of curiosity. **5/10**

**Kokoro Connect** (4/13): I put this show on hold. It felt kind of boring, but I hear so much about it. Might pick it back up soon.

**Black Rock Shooter** (1/1): This was an alright OVA, but it felt like nothing was actually going on. Plus, the transitions got really annoying. **6/10**

**The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya** (12/28): This was a show that I've been planning to watch for a pretty long time now and finally got to it. I'm liking everything right now and have been watching it in chronological order. I'm on the endless eight arc and I plan on skipping at least half of it.
>> ARTICLE
You've got to be one of the only other people I've seen online who is not liking Kokoro Connect.


I don't want to be a person who puts someone off of a show that they're only four episodes into, but thinking about it, I would have wanted someone to tell me to stop if I were in your position. I really did not like it at all. The first arc is by far the best, and the second arc is definitely the worst. If you successfully make it through the second arc and like it, you might be O.K, but really do not expect much.
>> ARTICLE
I blasted through both seasons of **Chihayafuru** in 3 days. It was an amazing ride - and its been a while since I've loved each and every character in a show this much. Watching Taichi grow was undoubtedly the best part of the show, and it really is remarkable seeing how much he changed from the little bully that he was. And the karuta - wow! It was really great to see something so obscure portrayed in such a compelling fashion, and it really caused me to want to know more about the game. Liked how they slowly explored the depth of the game throughout its run - by the end of the show it seemed completely different from how it looked at first.

Pity that it isn't finished - this is a show I probably can blast through even if it had more than a hundred episodes. I finished the remaining manga chapters as well and it looks like it manages to get even better, and I really hope that they adapt it once we get enough material.

**10/10** for sure, definitely within my top 3, might even be my favorite. Have to think a little more about that!
>> ARTICLE
**Psycho Pass (9/22)**

This show is pretty good. The story is taking its time but it's still interesting. It doesn't hold my interest enough to compelled me to marathon it or anything but I'm slowly working my way through. The characters seem interesting enough, but a lot of the supporting cast is kind of underdeveloped (hopefully that will change). Above all, the soundtrack is definitely the stand out feature for this anime. Absolutely love it. In relation to Gen Urobuchi's other works, I'd rank this above Madoka Magica, but below Fate/Zero
>> ARTICLE
I just finished this a few days ago, I felt the exact same way. Somewhere around episode 15 I think is where it hooks you. Gets much more intense. Have fun!
>> ARTICLE
Couple from me, but this is like the last week and a half's watching 

[Yosuga no Sora: In Solitude, Where We Are Least Alone](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8861/Yosuga_no_Sora:_In_Solitude_Where_We_Are_Least_Alone.)

I'm not sure why I watched this. I have a little sister, so I'm *really* uncomfortable with incest based story lines. Neither am I a massive fan of ecchi. Still, I was genuinely surprised at how well the show came together. Some of the character arcs were genuinely emotional, and the soundtrack is lovely. My main problem with it came to the sex scenes, which either fell into being emotional high points, or cheesy bolted on fap material. Still not a bad watch overall. 

**7/10**

[Sora No Woto/The Sound of the Skies](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To)

This show took me over 9 months to finish. I got pissed off with it about half a year ago and put it on hold. Sora No Woto does such a great job of creating an atmosphere, I was in tears for some of the early episodes. I still can't hear Amazing Grace without welling up. But then that plot had to come. I mean it literally phoned in, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jji78uEW14) (if you imagine Steven Seagal is on the phone in this scene). The plot takes so much away from the atmosphere and feeling that the show built up. Still last 2 episodes are amazing, and I was crying at the end.

[Kuragehime / Princess Jellyfish](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8129/Kuragehime)

If you follow me on twitter (you poor soul) you might have seen me tweeting an awful lot about this. Devoured it in about a day and a half, with episodes on at work and everything. Kuragehime is like your typical NEET story, but with Fujiyoshi's, crossdressers and Kana Hanazawa. Absolutely adored it for pretty much the entire thing. And then it just ended. 

Like with no closure. 

I've just started the manga.

**Did a writeup for this too. it's over [here](https://animeopinion.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/kuragehime-an-anime-review/)**

>Kuragehime

Oh damn, someone else who has actually seen this show? I didn't think this would happen the same week I finished it.

I really liked the fact that Kuragehime was sufficiently different from other shows in the same genre to be fresh. Sure, it uses many of the same tropes as other romantic comedies/slice of life shows, but the gender reversals made it pretty fun. Definitely worth it in my book.

But yeah, the ending was kinda disappointing. I guess that's what happens with manga adaptations sometimes.

[Blue Comet SPT Layzner](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3079/Aoki_Ryuusei_SPT_Layzner)  
What baffles me about this show is the quality. The mecha are drawn and shaded at the high quality of 1980s OVAs, but this is a TV show. I wonder if they had a surplus of money and dropped it into this show.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Sakura Trick. That shit is the best.
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt** this week. What was up with that ending? Is it going to get a season 2? The show was pretty funny regardless. Hoping to start Gunbuster this week, can't find anywhere to watch it though.
>> ARTICLE
If they ever planned a second season there's almost no chance it will ever happen now. The people behind it are no longer with the same studio.
>> ARTICLE
I finished watching [SAO](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) from episode 10 and TBH it may be overly hyped, but by the lords do the Anti-fans of this show take the biscuit for exaggeration. Kirito himself was, while hardly a 3D character was not as overpowered as I expected and it was the constant deus ex machina solutions that spoiled the tension for me.

The series itself was entertaining, if flawed. I got kicks out of the little combat there was, wanted KiritoxAsusna to develop properly. It fails to use it's settings or characters to even close to their potential, villains that were somehow kind of flatter than everything else, second arc made me roll my eyes a lot [SAO] (/s "Netorare bird cage, tentacled employees, and Recon's very existence") and the unnecessa-harem Mk-1. 

All in all, was worth the time to watch it even if it was to just see what was so damn hypeable about it.
>> ARTICLE
Finished watching Madoka today and I am definitely a fan now. I really liked the art style and the animation of the witch's labyrinths. By the end of the series I really came to care for the characters and it was damn sad what some of them had gone or been through. At first I thought Madoka was a passive and self pitying character until I realized she was actually the opposite because she would think things through before making a choice instead of being impulsive. I see now why some argue this show was a deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Anyway the music was great, Homura was my favorite character, and I'm looking forward to the movies even though 1 and 2 are recaps.

Also I want to strangle Kyubey.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the recap movies after I finished the series and it was really cool to see everything after you know how it's going to end. You can definitely understand the reaction of the characters more than you might have in your first watch.
>> ARTICLE
Prompted by the insane sales of season two, I watched **Love Live! School Idol Project**.

---
**Love Live!** - 6.5/10
___

Fun. That's all I really have to say about this. It was an entertaining show with likeable characters, solid comedy, and good music (if you like these kinds of songs).

My only complaint is I felt it tried too hard with the drama in the second half, and [](/s "I would've preferred if Kotori left in the end. They built up her character arc, they could've at least finished it.")

Anyway, fun show.

**WataMote (1-12)** - This was suppose to be a comedy and there are a lot of jokes but usually at the expense of Tomoko.
>> ARTICLE
Watched 2 movies and started back up on a series again.

**Paprika** (movie)  
Visually overwhelming, cool and interesting story, but some of the characters weren't as engaging as they maybe should have been. Good soundtrack and I'm looking forward to watch the other Satoshi Kon movies. (Rating: 8,5/10. 9 on MAL)

**The Girl Who Leapt Through Time** (movie)  
Awesome from start to end. I highly enjoyed this one because of the characters, story, pacing and the soundtrack. Makoto is such a good MC and I really could connect to her (shed a tear or two in the end). I thought that nothing could beat Mononoke Hime for me, but damn, this is like really really REALLY close to it. (Rating: 9,5/10)

**Baccano!** (ep3-4)  
Things are starting to get interesting, but still nothing much to say about it. Kind of a lot of characters I have to remember but most remarkable are Isaac and Miria.
>> ARTICLE
With Baccano!, the fact that most of the characters appear in the opening credits with their names helps you to remember who they each are. Also, the fact that the OP is just amazing means you always watch it!
>> ARTICLE
Isac and mira are defiantly memorable. 
>> ARTICLE
**A Certain Magical Index 2 (16/24)** Although Touma is a typical shounen protagonist he's still pretty entertaining to watch. I've always loved the idea of science and religion coexisting so one of my major gripes is how only two episodes so far have been focused on science and the rest on religion. Even thought the Remnant arc was short it's been my favorite arc. Hopefully there'll be more of a focus on science in the remaining episodes. On a side note I can't stand Index and I wish they gave her screentime to [Biribiri](http://i.imgur.com/MyjoXon.jpg) instead. Fukou da!
>> ARTICLE
if A Certain Magical Index ever gets a third season you can bet there will be a lot more Science and Magic/Religion stuff going on.
>> ARTICLE
I finished watching A Certain Magical Index 1 last week and just finished A Certain Scientific Railgun, have to say I liked Railgun a lot more, even though they both weren't near the best animes I've watched, I enjoyed them quite a bit. Going into A Certain Magical Index 2 pretty soon!
>> ARTICLE
I just started up G Gundam. I'm enjoying it a lot, but I hope it becomes less of a "one-off episode" type show. After finishing Victory Gundam the day before, I'd say that G isn't even a Gundam show.

[x-post from trueanime](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2bps91/your_week_in_anime_week_93/cj7zmli)

Welp it's that time of the week again. This past week I've been on vacation so I've been able to power through a lot of stuff. First lets focus on the series. 

**Nisemonogatari (11/11)**

I've gone over this show many times now and I don't need to elaborate any further. In comparison to Bakemonogatari, this show had way to much fan service and way to little character development. Not only does the show barely give much to the characters of previous arcs, it barely gives anything to the *characters the arc is focusing on!* Of the 7 episode Karen arc, I think maybe the last 3 were actually about Karen and her problems, and in Tsukihi's arc, there was about 1 conversation regarding actual development to her as a character. This show was a serious step down in quality from its wonderful prequel. How was it followed up? Well...

**Nekomonogatari Kuro (4/4)**

Wow what a refreshing change. In contrast to Nise, Nekomongatari Kuro had *loads* of character development for both Hanekawa and her relationship with Ararararararagi. Despite the obvious constant fan service of black lingerie, it wasn't nearly as obnoxious Nise. Yes you heard me, having a character perpetually in her underwear was still less fan service than Nise, that's how bad Nise's fanservice was. Overall it was a great step back into the ring for the Monogatari series, and next week I start the most acclaimed part of Monogatari, Monogatari Second Season.

-----------------

Now for something completely differnet, movies. It shames me to say it, but I am terrible on Anime Movies. My history with them consists of some series movies (Haruhi, Eden of the East, Pokemon), and Mamoru Hosoda. Yes, that's it. No Makoto Shinkai, no Akira, no Redline, hell I can not honestly remember seeing a single **Ghibli** movie all the way through. I've seen a part of Nausica, but not much else. So when the /r/anime movie bracket started up, I decided to get my butt in gear and watch some movies over my vacation. I'm not done yet but here is what I've gotten through

**Spirited Away**

Current popular favorite to win the bracket, and a lot of people's favorite ghibli movie, this was the first up to bat, and my first full experience with ghibli. And...uh...Wooooooooooowwwwww... Like holy shit that was pretty fucking great. Tight story, great characters, Sen/Chihiro was adorable and a just overall great lead, and the movie was beautiful and wonderfully orchestrated. I get now why people love this movie so much, because it's amazing. The sense of wonder I got from watching this is fantastic, just a fantastically built world and did a great job inspiring excitement just to see it. I can't help but feel a little sad I never watched this as a child, I would have adored it.

**Howl's Moving Castle**

Next up on the plate we have Howl's Moving Castle, another Ghibli classic that I remember seeing many a trailer as a child but never got around to seeing the actual dang movie. Well similar to Spirited Away, another wooooooow was to be had, with some more fantastic art and music, and more wonderfully interesting and unique characters. Howl's castle was mesmerizing to watch, and the characters play off each other beautifully. If I had to nitpick, which I do, there are 2 things I had a problem with. 1 was Sophie, Sophie was a weak character. She never seemed to change or learn anything during the film, and she seemed to let things happen rather easily. She never had the same sort of personality or growth that a character like Chihiro did, and was kind of bland. The other problem was much smaller, and just was that the plot points with the war and the prince were poorly introduced. I don't know if I missed something, but I had to look up the Wikipedia page to understand what actually happened. Maybe that was just me though... Either way fantastic watch, and Hayao Miyazaki is great.

**5 Centimeters per Second**

After getting through two Hayao Miyazaki films (I plan to complete at least 3 by watching Princess Mononoke soon.), I figured it was time for a change of pace, so I started on Makoto Shinkai. And what better place to start than the classic 5 ~~Wallpapers~~ Centimeters per Second. Funny enough, I think the show itself was so high quality my phone or MX video couldn't handle it because the sound kept cutting out randomly. Even despite that though, it was a fantastic watch. I much more simple story than Miyazaki, it dealt with love that gradually grows apart over time, not by emotion but by distance. It was a beauty to see, and the sound and animation were as spectacular as I had heard. The ending was rather sad but maybe a little hopeful as well, and a perfect way to finish this rather sad simple tale about rather ordinary people. The insert song also was absolutely perfect as well.

**Into the Forest of the Fireflie's Light**

I spotted this on the nomination list, and had never heard of it. It wasn't lauded around the same way that Ghibli or Makoto Shinkai was, and I was curious. Imagine my suprise when I found out the Director was Takahiro Omori, the director of Durarara, Baccano, Samurai Flamenco, and the unseen by me Natsume's Book of Friends! This guy is awesome! And it was produced by Brains Base! My favorite studio, more awesome! So I was hopeful coming into this short 44 minute movie, and it didn't disappoint. If 5 ~~Gahthislookssoamazing~~ Centimeters per Second was the story of a love that grew apart with time, this was the story of a love that was only given a limited amount of time. A simple but sweet tale of a spirit man and a young girl, it was a fantastic sweet tale of a friendship that blossomed into a romance, that ended it a tragedy that we all knew was coming but didn't make its passing any easier. Everything that needed to happen was wrapped up in a neat 40 minute bow, and it was tight with no saggy bits. Animation was lovely as usual for Brains Base, and the music was delightful as always. Brains Base continues being Brains Based.

-------

So now here we are and I've seen quite a bit more. I already have downloaded and ready to go

* Princess Mononoke
* Voices of a Distant Star
* Children who chase lost voices from deep below
* The promised place beyond the clowds

I plan to get some more done as well, after dropping down to 28 airing shows from my original 34 and the international being over (poor EE-sama) I expect to have more time. Next week I focus on these shows and getting back to Shinsekai Yori, as well as starting Monogatari Second Season in time to watch Hanamonogatari. If any of you out there have some suggestion on what movie to watch next, let me know. The movie tournament thread is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2bc41g/anime_movie_tournament_top_64_reveal_and_bracket/)

That's all from me, have a great weekend all you lovely people!

Started watching Brotherhood after the original, amazing ride so far.
>> ARTICLE
One of the shows I watched was **Monogatari Series: Second Season**. It was amazing, especially since I loved the first season and Nisemonogatari. I think this season was better than the first, we got a lot of loose ends tied up from the first season. My favourite arc from this season has to be the Nadeko arc, from the glorious opening song to the change of her character, it just made me love her so much considering her character in the first season.

Also I watched **Senjou no Valkyria**, a war anime about the son of a famous war hero. It started off pretty alright, but I felt that it dragged out a bit too much, especially when they started adding fantasy when it was really unneeded considering how industrial based it was at first. However I enjoyed the OVA's more than the actual anime itself, the characters in the anime were a bit to cliche for my liking, however the new cast in the OVA's looked quite promising
>> ARTICLE
**White Album 2 (13/13)**
This one definitely underwhelmed me a little bit and at the end I found myself disliking each of the main characters for their own reason. Gave it a 7/10.

**Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko (12/12)**
This one surprised me! I went in with low expectations considering the word "hentai" is in the title and I assumed it would just be fanservice nonstop (which I don't tend to like). I ended up with a series that had one of the most adorable main girls in anime and a twist near the end that I didn't expect and loved!

edit:formatting
>> ARTICLE
With White AAlbum, I'm pretty sure you're meant to dislike each of them a bit at the end. They are terrific, flawed, human characters. Still the bittersweet ending is definitely more bitter than sweet.

Henneko is a great watch, I rewatched it recently and I found that the twist was so well worked into the story. It made so much sense, ending made me tear up again
>> ARTICLE
**Fate/Zero 2nd season**

You know, I usually love a focus on characters and story. I love it when there's so much at stake, lots of unique characters with their own motivations and so on. But for some reason, I just can't get into this.

I like challenging anime where you don't just shut your brain off and enjoy, but I almost feel too stupid for Fate/Zero. Most of the time the pacing is bit slow and I'm starting to get bored because the dialogue is so extended, but when the action happens I feel lost. Who did that servant belong to? Why is he attacking that other servant again? What was the masters motivation again? 

One the one hand not enough stuff happens, but when it does, so much is going on at the same time that I can never make any sense out of it. I have so many question but I'm afraid I'll sound stupid if I ask them. I feel that I need to watch every episode two or three times in order to really understand what's happening. It doesn't help that I always confuse the church assassin guy with Saber's master. I'll put some of my questions in spoiler tags, just in case.

[Question 1](/s "Who is that Sakura girl and why does the white haired guy with the bugs in his skin or something want to protect her?")

[Question 2](/s "Who is Gilgamesh's master? What is his relation to the other characters? Why does he want to win the grail war? I think he works together with Assassin's master?")

>> ARTICLE
I thought all that stuff was pretty well explained. Sakura is Rin Tohsaka's sister, who was given to the Matou family so she would be able to keep her magic ability. Magical families are only allowed one child with powers, if I remember correctly. The white-haired guy, Kariya, also belongs to the Matou family, and wants to protect the Tohsaka family because he is secretly in love with Tokiomi Tohsaka's wife, Aoi. 

Gilgamesh is the servant of Tokiomi Tohsaka in the beginning, but [Kotomine Kirei] (/s "betrays him, kills him and assumes command of Gilgamesh after Kirei's servant Assassin dies.") He wants to win the Holy Grail, because he sees himself as the rightful king of the world, and believes that all the world's treasures, including the Grail, belong to him.

It's been a while since I saw the show, so I don't remember the details clearly. I hope it helped, though.
>> ARTICLE
Started and finished **Cowboy Bebop**, finally. It is indeed a good show, though I don't really think it deserves the praise it gets, since there are much better things around. It is a fairly good anime from old times, but not definitely a "must-watch". It suffers a bit from its episodic nature (some episodes are awesome, others are just... wtf) and the strange relationship between the characters (they sometimes care for each other and sometimes hate each other, it really is weird.). I did like their backstories a lot, especially Feye's. And, like I said, some episodes are really well done. Rating is *17/20*.

Started and finished **Hitsugi no Chaika**. I wasn't expecting much, but I was greeted with a really good story, with some interesting and unexpected plot twists, funny characters and, most importantly, the lack of ecchi. It has so many females, yet I saw 1 ecchi scene, which is quite impressive. I do not dislike fanservice, but I praise this show for actually not having any when it almost seems a typical fanservice show. Rating is *15/20*.

Started **Watamote** today. Well, I must say, I'm impressed. I really like Tomoko, she might actually be one of my favorite female characters in anime. I really feel bad for her, she has so much bad luck it is almost surreal (well, it is a fiction but damn). There are some... cringe-worthy moments, but mostly it is just a fun experience. I can understand some people disliking it, but so far I would recommend it if you want a different experience from the usual SoL.
>> ARTICLE
**Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) - 25/25** - Someone told me to watch it as they considered it one of their favourite, most underrated anime ever. It was entertaining enough to watch but I found it to be needlessly convoluted at times. Some of the explanations for what was going on seemed to be half-assed and only there to withhold information to keep the audience interested. Regardless of that I enjoyed the series, especially the twists at the end. No memorable characters apart from Squealer. **7/10**

**Seitokai Yakuindomo - 13/26** - Watched the first season of this and it was pretty funny. Didn't expect it to be so crude as I didn't look into anything about it before I started watching. I expected typical high school, slice of life romcom. Turned out to be something quite special. I stopped watching after the first season to watch something else as I'm not sure I need another 13 episodes of raunchy, in-your-face sex jokes, but it's probably something I'll go back to after a while. **7/10**

**Gin no Saji (Silver Spoon) - 22/22** - I didn't know I could fall in love with farming and agriculture so much after spending 20 years of my life avoiding it due to hayfever. Incredibly entertaining to watch, quite moving at times, deals with a lot of real issues that you really sympathise with, and as a bonus you might actually learn a lot about farming and agriculture. Don't skip this one because of the setting. It's an amazing series. **9/10**

**Toradora! - 16/25** - I really didn't know what to think of this one 4 episodes in. It had really high ratings as well as being a personal favourite of someone I know of (EE-sama). I'll put it out there that I really dislike tsundere girls. I don't like watching the main character get kicked in the face every 5 minutes by some antsy, borderline unlikeable character. It was too much tsun and not enough dere for my liking. Stuck with it though and I'm glad I did. It's got a surprising amount of depth to it and perhaps there'll be even more with the episodes to come. Not sure what direction it's taking. Wouldn't be surprised if it ended with a lot of life lessons about love and blah blah blah, but I'd really like a relationship to spawn between at least one of these characters.

*I watched a lot of anime this week.*
>> ARTICLE
Hellsing, I would've marathoned (is that the right tense?) it, but sadly the 12th episode was in english and it really put me off.

Nichijou, absolutly amazing, after some time, the laughing just started to hurt.

Cowboy Bebop, I finally started to watch this classic, still busy though.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not usually a fan of pure comedy shows but **Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (12/12)** actually made me laugh out loud several times while watching. 

I also watched **Kokoro Connect (17/17)** which was probably one of the better romance series I've seen. Too bad there will probably never be a season 2. Seriously what's with romcoms and awful second seasons (Oreimo, Chuunibyou) or nonexistent ones?

**Suisei no Gargantia (13/13):** Thoroughly enjoyed the world and characters, though some aspects were really underdeveloped, especially how the whole main conflict at the beginning kind of gets shoved into the background unresolved. 
>> ARTICLE
**White Album 2 (13/13)**

This show crushed my soul with all of the characters.  Best Trainwreck of a show with it's Romance and Drama, it's up there with Clannad AfterStory for sure.

**Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou.... Ahh! (7/12)**

One of the most funniest and relatable shows I've watched in a long while.  Every joke was pretty much a hit in it.  I especially like the Daily lives of Highschool girls segment after the credits for each episode.  The part where the guy throws chocolate at the girls to calm them down was hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
I've had this past week off so I was able to marathon two thirteen episode animes!

**Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!** *12/12* If any of you have dealt with social anxiety or are/have been in socially awkward situations this one will probably have you laughing. I found the main character, Tomoko, to be very relatable! (Almost felt like I was watching myself in an anime at some points.) Great share of funny moments but some serious/sad parts in there too. **8.5/10**

**Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World** *13/13* This anime was recommended to me by a friend, and I must say I did enjoy it. Going into it I thought it was a continuous plot rather than an episodic anime (my bad for not reading into it more before watching), but I liked it more than I thought it would! Some episodes really stick with you (the second episode for me, in particular.) **8/10**

As for what I'm starting this week...

**Seitokai Yakuindomo Season 2** *4/12* I loved the first season of SYD, I don't think I have ever laughed that hard at an anime ever. And so far the second season has me laughing so I hope the hilarity ensues!

**Trigun** *2/26* I have been meaning to watch this anime for a long, *long* time. I remember seeing a few episodes of this as a kid and getting quite a kick out of Vash, so I decided to finally start this after knocking off a couple of other animes that had been on my list. I am only on the second episode but I adore Vash and really like Meryl and Milly. Looking forward to seeing where it goes!
>> ARTICLE
Like several others, it seems, I watched **Evangelion** and **End of Evangelion**. I liked it. It certainly isn't perfect, but it was good. Too much was unexplained at the end, and in the movie, Shinji was made into a creeper (basically because the animator is an asshole who hates his fans).  I think it was worth watching, but I have no plans to ever rewatch it. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
**Outbreak company** - 12/12:  Just finished it up a couple of nights ago.  I'm a big fan of Scrapped Princess and Chaika, so I guess I was expecting more out of it - but it was pretty good, all things considered.  A solid 7/10.  Some of the humor fell flat for me, and I would have liked a little more resolution to some of the relationships, but i get it's based on a still-running series of light novels and they were probably hoping for a second cour.  
>> ARTICLE
Outbreak company was interesting since otaku culture was one of the primary plot points. Very few anime actually has this. Or maybe I just haven't seen them yet.
>> ARTICLE
genshiken springs to mind, and iirc there have been a few others. Definitely there are lots of shows these days which contain more self-aware elements of Otaku culture. Daru or the maid cafes in Steins;gate for example. 
>> ARTICLE
Genshiken is definitely a classic. Sure there's anime that have otaku culture references here and there but I haven't seen many that makes it one of the major plot points.
>> ARTICLE
Katekyo Hitman Reborn - the build up was ridicilous. 128 episodes and over 5 episodes of references. Too bad it ended and the 2 last arcs are not probably coming.
>> ARTICLE
**Guilty Crown (10/26)**

I admit I like this show so far. The OST is amazing, it looks fantastic and Inori is smokin hot. My main problem with this show is Shu because he is very irritating as a character. Sometimes he is angry, and then he is depressed and then he is kind of ok with everything and then he accidently grabs some boobs, I dunno he is just not very likeable for me.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/zero. Boy did I love it. I watched the first half of the first season when it aired, but stopped watching anime somewhere around there. Decided last week to pick it back up and I did not regret it. It puts a contrast on so many things for FSN, which makes me appreciate the characters in FSN a bit more.
>> ARTICLE
So this last week I rewatched **The World God Only Knows** and watched a good bit of **Shiki**.

**Shiki** is setting itself up to be a fairly decent vampire show, but the pacing is slow so far. I'm only on episode 6 but the repetition is starting to grate on me as it doesn't feel like anybody is making too many revelations. I mean... I get it. A lot of people are dying from some mysterious illness that only shows as anemia before the person inexplicably dies. What next? The only character I connected with on any level was the first girl that died because the whole episode was about her, but I hated her character so I felt kinda glad when she bit it.

Some things though are done really well. Aforementioned creepy stalker chick sneaking into the house to kill that one guy was extremely well paced, and really made use of a limited animation budget to add a lot of atmosphere to the whole situation. The creepy little obviously-vampire girl and her talks about death also have hauntingly true observations about the life vs death struggle that all living things have. 

But I just want this show to start taking me somewhere instead of going, "Hey look! Isn't that weird? Doesn't it seem like something is amiss?" Yeah, I already know something is amiss because I read the back of the box. Now lets see what you'll do with this set-up already.

I'd also like to note that this show has the worst case of bad anime hair I've ever seen barring Yugioh. Holy shit.

**The World God Only Knows** is a show I've seen before, but I'm happy to rewatch now that it's been a couple of months and my head is out of the clouds about season 3. And to be completely honest, I'm still a bit in awe at how good it really is. It's not a show everyone will like as it does have a huge "girl of the week" focus for the first two entire seasons, but it does what it aims to so well that I can't help but admire it. The show is intensely aware of it's tropes and takes a unique angle on the idea of how taking a trope's typical character flaw and solving it will cause them to fall in love. But what I like the most is that it's *because* they have that flaw fixed, but are still noticeably flawed human beings that makes them feel like they are actual characters that grew as a result of Keima's endeavors, and are continuing to grow without him. Watching how they grow out of that mold that their trope defines them as without making them suddenly super happy and perfect is gratifying, and makes Keima's analyzing interesting, and his efforts worth it. It makes every character endearing, and of course Keima and Elsie are endlessly entertaining as their chemistry with each other really shows while they play off of each other. 

I highly recommend it to anyone that likes rom-coms, and quite possibly even if you don't. It's got a huge focus on the moe aspect of things but it all plays to the show's favor in what it's trying to do. It both celebrates and satirizes anime tropes and culture without ever feeling like it's trying to hard, and I enormously enjoy it. Guess it's why it's still in my top 5 favorite shows of all time.
>> ARTICLE
**Hyouge Mono 15-32:** I have 7 episodes left, and I'm not yet seeing why it garnered so much praise from those few who watched it. It's a mess, to be honest. Most episodes have no focus due to constant timeskips and lots of little unrelated plots that never seem to converge. Things happen offscreen which advance the state of affairs considerably, and they aren't really elaborated on. I suppose this is aimed at those who know their history, rather than viewers with just some general knowledge of the era. 

There are dozens of characters that are usually lacking in distinctive features. They change names all the time, so I find easy to get confused as to who is allied with who and whatnot. Many of them have their own little plotlines, too, and they're ultimately forgettable because the characters are so minor.

There's a very limited selection of music used in the show, and it almost never works. Whatever plays rarely fits the tone of the scene, or it becomes too distracting. Then there are things like the music in the runup to the ED just cutting out in the middle.

Scene transitions aren't handled that poorly, because there's usually a message about the time and location where events are taking place. As a westerner with limited knowledge of little villages in Japan, the place names rarely provide much context for me, though. 

The plot is meandering to follow actual history, so just about the only saving grace is the main characters. Furuta has many faces and is constantly changing his outlook on life as the show goes on. It's quite interesting seeing him change as he tries to keep up with trends in the world of aesthetes, or to watch his ambitions grow. The others aren't nearly as interesting to watch, because we just don't get the same insight into them as we do Furuta. 

Comedy is another strongpoint. The premise is ridiculous, for one, and it's a running theme throughout the show. Everything is tea, imperfection, simplicity, and the life of an aesthete. It can get bogged down by political happenings, but they're often resolved by a hard bargain over tea, or the trade of a priceless piece of art. I sometimes find myself internally laughing at the situation rather than any dialogue. Although some of that is certainly sharp and witty, at least sometimes. 

Just as an aside: Date Masamune in this is voiced by the same guy who voiced him in Sengoku Basara. Has that ever happened before? A seiyuu being that attached to a historical character. 

**Jewelpet Happiness 39-43:** This last third is a bit of a slog. The red moon is now consistently controlling the minds of pets, which makes for less fun episodes than before. The events can be sillier, but there's now a hint of drama involved that just doesn't belong.

And at this point I realise that the characters have been completely static over the course of the anime. Not that uncommon or necessarily bad for a comedy, but it will almost certainly make this fairly forgettable after I'm done with it.

**Hitsugi no Chaika (12/12)**

I heard good things about season 1 and saw that the second season is coming in the fall so I decided to check it out.  I was fairly impressed, its one of the better fantasy series I've seen.  Chaika is probably the most unique character design I've seen in a while, how many other 14 year old girls do you see carrying massive coffins on their backs with magical sniper rifles?

Toru is a pretty good MC, he has some anti-hero traits that set him apart from a lot of other shounen pro tags but he still has his fair share of cliches.  I thought he was going to be another generic incompetent MC but since he met Chaika and found a purpose, he's become a much more likable character.

The world building that they've done has been pretty cool, its fairly unique, especially the fact that magic is powered mostly by fossil fuels or corpses or the like.  And its also nice that the tone is relatively grey, the MCs aren't necessarily the good guys, the antagonists aren't necessarily the bad guys.  In fact there has really only been one or two characters that I would describe as "evil" which is a nice change of pace.

On the whole a very solid show and I'll be looking forward to the next season in the fall.  I have so many questions that I want answered so it should be an interesting ride.  One other thing, why are all the characters named after cars?  Chaika Trabant, Toru Acura, Dominica Skoda?

**Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to the Animation (12/12)**

Not really sure why I decided to pick this one up but it was reasonably funny.  It reminded me a bit of SYD if the genders were flipped, but I think that the fact that its the girls making the ridiculous dirty jokes that makes SYD so funny.  That being said there were some absolutely ridiculous moments, particularly the elevator scene in episode 10, the only thing that was going through my mind was "Is this really happening?!?"

Overall not a bad show, nothing particularly special but it did have some really funny moments and the episode are pretty short so its not a big deal.

Just now I'll watch the remaining few episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. While it seemed to be a generic Shounen at the beginning, though with a nice introduction to characters, FMA:B stood out and picked up the pace in [EP. 10](/s 'with Hughes' death.') Since that point I've just wanted to continue on, and today I'll see it through.

Got back into anime recently after a childhood of Naruto, Yugioh, DBZ etc., and finished **Fate/Zero** and **Steins; Gate** this past week. Fate's action scenes were spectacular, and also had a pretty great story to boot! Excited to see how the Fate/Stay Night anime and movie turn out! 

Steins; Gate, however, was the highlight for me. The first six episodes were mostly slice of life, and started off really slow and confusing as people have said, but began to pick up pace and clarify things quickly. Having stopped at around episode 5 a few weeks ago, I'm truly glad to have finally finished this show. I was shocked when shit hit the fan in [episode 12](/s "when Mayuri gets shot in the head. People weren't joking when they said to just wait for it.") and things started picking up real quickly after that. All in all, an excellent series, mixing the intriguing concept of time travel with action and some genuinely cute, emotional, and happy moments with a great cast of characters. [spoiler](/s "Tuturu~ and Okabe and Kurisu's relationship were d'aww moments for me") 

After the final episode, I had to go and watch the OVA and movie too. I found both excellent and I feel that they brought the series to a suitable end. I was thinking about checking out the VN, any thoughts?

If anyone has any recommendations that aren't in my [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/pigofwar), I'd love to hear them!

I watched my bluray of The Devil Is a Part Timer. I watched it dubbed this time around. It wasn't as funny as I remember and I'm not sure if that's because of the dub voices throwing me off or if I'm that much more of a cynical asshole. I didn't notice the budget animation quality last time, either.

>> ARTICLE
A very short week for me, as one game has a festival going on and another game has a special weekend happening. So my attention has been well-and-truly torn apart this week.

**Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: Next Chapter** - Status: **COMPLETE**

Yup. All I got to was a single 4-episode OVA that finishes off the show that finished me off completely and left me laying in the ruins of my own tear ducts. I've often mentioned that about Rumbling Hearts... And Next Chapter picked up almost exactly where it left off and gave a well-deserved full-stop to the story. 

Although I must say that I really didn't need the recap episode. Maybe some of you might have wanted one after three years had gone by, but I've got all twelve episodes burned into my brain and they will never entirely fade away. For me, it was something that I desperately wanted to skip forward through... But I couldn't, and only partly because I started crying again and couldn't find the pause button. True story. Final Score: **7/10**

Next up... Well, I'm torn. Do I want to go with [Akane Maniax](http://myanimelist.net/anime/281/Akane_Maniax) and into Muv-Luv? Do I want to go old-school and finally watch [I My Me! Strawberry Eggs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/509/I_My_Me!_Strawberry_Eggs)? Or do I want to be weird and perverted and watch [To-LOVE-Ru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3455/To_LOVE-Ru)? Or do I want to finally sit myself down and watch [Uchuu Kyoudai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai)? Decisions, decisions...
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, since finals are finally over here is what I watched: 

* **Jormungand** - A good action show, watched it over the week. The high point of this show is the life of these characters they introduce to us, this being the bodyguards and Koko, however I wasn't able to remember all the characters presented to me and I just kept tracking the most important: Jonah (the child soldier), Lehm (the badass leader of the team), Velmet (the woman), the guy that got shot in the ass, Mao [](/s "the fake death flag") and of course the beloved Koko, who ends up stealing most of the show.
It was nice but not a great story since I didn't felt any of them being in danger, everyone they faced seemed to be sub par. If you like good action

* **Girls und Panzer** - I spent half an afternoon with this, it wasn't really my intention, since I was planning on taking it slow and watch it over the week and in the end it made me interested in trying out a game about tanks, but I didn't went through that. Why am I surprised? I was delightful to find out that it incorporates strategy, as soon as I found about that, my idea of the show got obscured, it was no longer these "cute girls doing cute things", at least for me. It combined the smart with the ridiculous and I loved it.

* **Black Lagoon OVA:Roberta's Blood Trail** - Liked it, specially the character development of Rock over this OVA. Bad points: you don't see much of Revy, good points: Saw a hell more of the crazy maid, more crazier and more bloodthirsty. Although the [ending:](/s "I didn't like with everyone living, even though they are badly damaged. Although I loved Rock's new battle against Chang.")
It ends with me anxious for a new continuation, because it gathered up a story, it's no longer about doing jobs it has a proper purpose now, a great battle, a gang war.

* **Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! and the OVA** - Only watched the first season, won't watch anything else. Felt like it had a solid ending (that being the reason why I won't watch season 2), the comedy was great and the art was fabulous. The great points of this anime is turning from comedy to a serious show with intense situations (Yuuta and Dekomori talk in the train station made me tear up a bit).

* **Neon Genesis Envangelion** - I liked at first and I didn't like it. Well it is the same as most of opinions are: I liked the mecha, then tragedy occurred then "that" happened. You know, when "that" happened I started to loose interest, it was clear that the budget was gone and they were using scenes that I have seen before. I liked the theory behind it though, don't get me wrong I liked the whole "there is one different you to the people you meet" speech, it got me thinking "Huh, I haven't thought about it" but if Shinji really thought that everyone hated him, that made me think that Shinji is just an idiot, also there was quite some existentialist speeches that I've heard/thought before in my early teens, that's the part I didn't like (of the end). Liked the character development was fantastic mainly Asuka. It also leaves so much open before "that" happened, seriously how did "that" happened, that's the part that leaves me scratching my head, even if it was a whole universe, why didn't they continue the universe? Maybe I didn't understand it, or perhaps the show can't explain it self. Maybe I'm going to watch the movies someday.

**Still Watching:**

* **Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (3/24)** - It seems nice, I haven't made up a proper opinion about it though.

* **Arakawa Under the Bridge (5/12)** - It continues to be entertaining and hilarious, I can see mild shaft elements. Love the characters, every single one of them is hilarious and love the first opening, once the melody gets in my head it's hard to take it out (it's that sweet voice, this and the Space Dandy ED). I don't really have much to say about this.

* **Jormungand: The Perfect Order (5/12)** - Remember when I said there were a few characters that I didn't remember from the team, well apparently it was important now and during the first season it went completely silent for me, I didn't even know he existed. Introduces an interesting character. Just the first few episodes and I already find it better than the previous season, because that danger that I was referring to, seems now present in here.

**Movies:**

* **Tokyo Godfathers** - A delightful Christmas movie, I was expecting gangster kind of film set in Tokyo. It was a nice heart-warming story.

I think I'm forgetting some.

I watched a few OVAs that came out pretty recent-ish.

**Seitokai Yakuindomo * OVA**: More of the same from this series. I'd say it was about average compared to the season itself. So, about an 8/10.

**Genshiken Nidaime no Roku**: A new year's episode for some reason! It felt a little strange a jump from the anime, especially since I haven't read the manga. It had it's share of funny moments, and overall, it felt like it moved the story forward, but I don't really know what to make of it. The engrish parts were pretty annoying though. I have no idea how to rate this one, but if I had to, I'd give it an 8/10, having given the series a 10/10.

**GJ-bu@**: I loved the main series, and this seemed like more of the same. It had a pretty weak main theme though, and ended up with what felt like less banter and comedy than an average episode of the series. Its second half is pretty weird too, and ends in a cliche, though I don't know if that's a bad thing when it comes to this series. I give this a 7/10, having given the series an 8/10
>> ARTICLE
**Mysterious Girlfriend X** (10/13)

This show. This is quite unlike anything anything I've ever seen before. It does an excellent job of setting up the bizarre atmosphere it thrives on with it's sound design and 90's art style. Unfortunately, as it nears the end, it appears to be running out of things to do and is falling back on genre tropes/cliches.

To summarize; Weird People Doing Weird Things.

Anyway, to break up all of that weirdness, I started watching...

**Yuru Yuri** (12/12)

I went into this show with the "moeshit" label firmly affixed to it, and I must say, I enjoyed it so much more than I expected to. Admittedly, I haven't watched a lot of comedy anime, but of what I have, this is among the few that resonate with my sense of humour. Nothing much more to say about it, really. Funniest moment for me was probably the [](/s "tomato kigurumi.") Looking forward to watching season 2.

Noucome 1-10: I've heard a lot of good things about this show on animesuggest. Since the name reminds me of My Teen Romance SNAFU, which is one of the best SOLs out there, I decide to give it a shot. The idea of the show is pretty generic with a main character surrounded by 3 or 4 ladies who secretly like him. But the absolute choice ability he has is a great plot device to having him do stupid shit. One of the girls remind me of Senjouhara, so that was pretty awesome. I actually forgot I watched this show this week and it took me a while to remember, leading me to believe this show is pretty forgettable. 8/10

Chrono Crusade 1-3: The first time I saw this show was in that amv version of the song "The ultimate showdown". I know this show is a classic, but the first 3 episodes haven't really hooked me in yet. Part of this reason is because someone told me this show is suppose to be sad, so I'm feeling anxious about every little foreshadowing that could lead to tragedy.  Here's hoping they were lying and everything works out for Charlotte and Chrono. Here is the amv www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2gajRzTJsc

Revolutionary Girl Utena. I definitely did not catch the nuances of this show when I was young, but I really enjoyed the rewatch. It's surreal and can be thought provoking. The plot is pretty straight forward, but I think it's an interesting take on the magical girl genre - Utena wants to be a strong prince afterall.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time posting and I'm doing it from mobile so please bare with me but I literally *just* finished **Angel Beats,** and by God that show ended well! I'll avoid any spoilers. (Although, it seems as though just about all of this sub has seen it.) Anyway, to the point! My first impression with this show wasn't that great because a friend of mine talked the show up and the first episode didn't grab me. However, I came back to the show yesterday, after about a month since the first episode, and I loved it! It was hilarious,  especially the seen where they distracted the class in episode 5 (You know the one), but this show also did a great job of making you sympathize with the characters. I wasn't quite sure how they were going to make it end well in the last episode, but they definitely ended it well! I was nearly in tears the last 5 to 10 minutes of the show. All in all I have to rate this anime in my top 10 of all time. I definitely recommend watching it if you haven't yet!

Madoka Magica (12/12). I started it a few months ago, only got through 2 episodes. It got a lot better.
>> ARTICLE
I finished **His and Her Circumstances,** and was kind of disappointed. It was going really well for the first two thirds, and then the show's apparent complete lack of budget really came through. The animation for the last few episodes was so low-quality that I just couldn't get immersed. Paired with the lack of plot progression and the stupid read-the-manga ending, this was an unfortunate finish to an otherwise great show.

Also, I finished **Serial Experiments Lain.** Well, do I feel like my mind was violently sodomized by a jackhammer or what? I still have no clue what most of those scenes were about. Still, there were parts that were pretty enjoyable, and it did a great job at establishing a creepy, surreal atmosphere. Lain herself was a great character. Seeing the interactions between her alternate personalities and others, and even her alternate personalities with each other was fun. Overall I'd say it was good, but I might want to go over it again at some point in the future to see If I can make any more sense out of it.

Didn't watch much this week either

**The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [1/1]** I sort of expected this to be a more action oriented movie sort of like a Steins;Gate feel, but I was wrong. This movie is great and I thought it was a nice romance with some cool time travel aspects. 8/10 really good but I could have used some more explanation.

**Gunbuster [3/6]** I watched this to see NGE in the making and I sort of see it. I like it so far although I don't understand why they have to do pushups in the robot suits...
>> ARTICLE
>I don't understand why they have to do pushups in the robot suits...

Heh, that confused the hell out of me when I watched Episode 1. It was so... parody-like, you could say. But as you know, that aspect of the show kinda changes in the following 2 episodes.

As for "NGE in the making", I agree. It's not immediately obvious from the first episode, but I think there's some truth to it.
>> ARTICLE
It should be noted that The Girl Who Leapt Through Time was a sidequel to the novel of the same name. The aunt in the movie is the protagonist in the novel. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt similarly when i saw The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.  I was not expecting the tone that the movie had, i was expecting either harder scifi or more action, and less of the slice of life tone that happens for most of the movie.  I was at least expecting it to be more serious for its entirety.

Nisekoi:  I liked this show.  I was disappointed that best Girl Onodera doesn't seem like she's going to win, but i'm looking forward to S2.

Non Non Biyori OVA:  Pretty okay episode, not as good as a lot of episodes so far, but its nice to be able to see more of this show.

Bakemonogatari (S1):  I finished up through episode 12, and i'm confused why there are 3 more episodes in Tsubasa Cat according to some places and in other places it ends at episode 12?  I liked Tsubasa Cat and Hitagi Crab arcs, but Snake and Monkey arks were just painfully boring to me, especially Monkey.  Where do i go from here?  Do i watch Neko or Nisemonogatari next?

**Kuragehime (Princess Jellyfish) (11/11 finished)** - Not much to add from last week. Cool show that does romantic comedy in a slightly different way, though there is hardly enough romance to call it a romantic comedy. Some of the characters started getting annoying by the end of the show, and there was no real conclusion, so I think it could've been better, but all in all, it was a decent show.

**Gunbuster (6/6 finished)** - "Ah, so this is where *that* comes from!" is a thought that I had several times while watching Gunbuster. That thought may have been misguided on many occasions, as I haven't seen any of the mecha shows that came before Gunbuster, but I have a feeling Gunbuster was the beginning of many things. This OVA series walks the line between the "Fuck yeah, giant robots!" style of super robot shows and the darker kind of robot shows, and it does that superbly. It occasionally seems very much like a parody(e.g. when trainees are ordered to skip rope, run laps and stretch with their robots), but most of the time it's extremely sincere in all the best ways. War is hell, people die, people care for each other, stuff like that.

The best thing about the show, however, is how packed it is. 6 episodes, no filler. There are more battles and climaxes than in most 1-cour shows(and even some 2-cour shows), and everything feels relevant. While the art and animation can be lacking at times(or even minimalistic/nonexistent in the final episode in true Anno style), the execution is fantastic. I can definitely see this being an inspiration for almost all mecha shows that came after it(in some ways, it's even like a proto-Evangelion). Easy 10/10, storytelling doesn't get much better than this.
>> ARTICLE
**Sakurasou No Pet na Kanojo 6/24**

This is a rewatch. I decided I wanted more Sora(ta) and (Ma)shiro after watching NGNL. 

[Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](/s "My first time through, I remember thinking Sorata and Mashiro went well together and that the canon pairing made a lot of sense. I remember having a lot of warm and fuzzy feelings about Sorata taking care of Mashiro.")

[Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](/s "This time, I trying to be a bit more open minded, and I'm having less suspension of disbelief because of that. After 6 episodes in, I'm having a really hard time seeing why Mashiro is a good match for Sorata over Nanami other than it's the pushed relationship by the author. Having to take care of someone because they rely on you for everything isn't relationship material. Sure, it's great for the audience, but I'm finding it hard to see why Sorata would develop romantic feelings for Mashiro after putting myself in his shoes. Maybe Mashiro grows more as the series progresses. I honestly don't remember, but I'm starting to see why people on the internet were pushing hard for Nanami.")

Still, I'm enjoying the show as much as I did the first time through.

**Non Non Biyori 8/12**

Picked this one up after reading about it on the Slice of Life thread that popped up this past week. Not much to say here. It's a feel-good anime that makes you laugh out loud. It definitely deserves its spot on that list, from what I've seen so far. 
>> ARTICLE
**Samurai Flamenco (7/24?)**: Was having a ton of fun watching it because it was really similar to Kick Ass which I enjoyed. Watching the Flamenco Girls kick butt (and groins) was really fun and it made me wince a little each time it happened. Was really surprised when Gullotine Gorilla came out of nowhere though. Definitely wasn't expecting the show to take that turn.

**Welcome to NHK (3/24?)**: Still waiting for the story to really kick in. It was really funny watching the MC discover the wonders of the internet.

**Angel Beats! 13/13** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!)


It was filled with action. It was funny. It was dramatic. It was depressing as all hell at the end. I haven't been on this kind of emotional rollercoaster since Clannad. Yuri reminded me of Haruhi a decent bit with her Anti-Angel shenanigans. The soundtrack was pretty decent too. Also, I think T.K. is one of my favorite minor chracters in anime because of his random and silly Engrish. "Get chance and luck!" 8.5/10


**Angel Beats!: Another Epilouge 1/1** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10067/Angel_Beats!:_Another_Epilogue)


A 3-minute episode that gives closure to what happened to Otonashi at the end of series. Not going to spoil anything here for you guys. 8/10

Just about every comedic series has one of these episodes where the plot doesn't advance, but it still shows the silliness of most of the characters. 8/10


**Ergo Proxy 3/23** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/790/Ergo_Proxy)


I started watching this series because it was a recommendation from my little brother. So far, it's pretty good. I have alot of questions about what exactly is going on, but I'm sure they will all be answered once I keep watching. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
I'm finishing Madoka Magica later today. So far, I think it's one of the best shows I've watched in 18 years of anime. Not only is the story fantastic, but the art and music are amazing in their own right.

Also, i'm watching Initial D because i'm old and i like cars.

Don't know how I didn't see this post yesterday, will edit this post when I get home tomorrow 
>> ARTICLE
I watched Kotoura-san this weekend for no real reason. It was recommended to me so I gave it a shot. Talk about wasted potential. The first episode was probably the best episode of anime I've ever watched. Then it devolved into an average romcom with jokes that got old way too fast and terrible plot decisions like [Kotoura-san](/s "Kotoura completely forgiving Moritani instantly, and Kotoura forgiving her bitch of a mother in the finale and somehow blaming herself.")

5/10. The first episode and Kotoura being one of the cutest characters ever are the only things this show has going for it.
>> ARTICLE
Non Non Biyori, beautiful setting, music and animation was great and it has some really charming characters, Renge was the standout. 10/10

Just finished watching this today, I feel ready to move back to the country.

Thank goodness a second season is coming in the future.

**Hanasaku Iroha 26/26**

I finished this series up this week, watching episodes **11-26** in between going to Canada on vacation and keeping up with some currently airing shows. I'm not quite sure what I can say other than this might have just knocked *Gin no Saji* out of my top Slice of Life spot. With a perfect mix of comedy, drama, and romance, and some of the best characters I've had the pleasure to watch, this is also my new favorite P.A. Works anime. I spent the majority of last night sitting in bed pounding my fist into my mattress and trying not to tear up (I'm a very emotional watcher). 

10/10, and I'd highly recommend this anime. 

I'll be watching **Hanasaku Iroha: Home Sweet Home** tonight, and I'm glad I don't have to say goodbye to the series just yet. 

EDIT: I couldn't wait, and just watched **Home Sweet Home**. I'm impressed, I wasn't expecting much from a movie that came out two years after the series ended, but that was very good. I teared up a bit (once again, emotional watcher). 
>> ARTICLE
I recently finished it too, I entirely agree with what you said. Such a great show. I'm looking forward to the new show by P.A. Works next season.
>> ARTICLE
Me too. I've spent the past couple of weeks trying to watch all of P.A. Works' shows (I watched NagiAsu when it was airing, Angel Beats! a bit later, and last week went through Uchouten Kazoku and Another). I love them all, and I'm incredibly excited for Glasslip. I think it's my most hyped show of summer. 
>> ARTICLE
I said this to /u/flubbityfloop as well, but it always puts a smile on my face when I see someone else watching the show. 

I think the show does a great job of actually capturing life at a delicate stage, and it doesn't descend into the *feels-a-tron* that other serious SoL shows can. It really is a great show.
>> ARTICLE
[**Mawaru Penguindrum**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum) was a really fun anime at the begining, with all the cuteness and charming/weird comedy you could ask for. It also has [the most fun transformation sequence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_bT16afOy0) I've seen. Have I mentioned that the weirdness factor is high in this anime?
And for the second half Penguindrum became a really great metaphor heavy pschological drama. It dealt with some heavy themes, one time it was downright disturbing even. It was a wild ride from begining to end and I really enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
Watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, something I've been putting off for a while because I read the manga first, pretty glad I finally decided to watch it though, it's really great!
>> ARTICLE
Same here buddy... Watching NGE atm too, gotta say I'm pretty sure either I've watched it already or the show is incredibly predictable. (pretty sure I've watched it and have very little recolection of it though, I already new the opening after hearing it for 3 secs xD) Nonetheless it is AWESOME! Episode 18 ATM

**The Garden of Words (Complete):**

[Mini-review here](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/the-garden-of-words-closeness-is-the-absence-of-words/). Which makes it interesting, since I want to say something here without just saying all of that again ;-) So it'd be a bit more constructed, I guess.

I like Makoto Shinkai. He has a shtick, and all of his works deal with that shtick. Thankfully for me, it's a shtick I care for. Thankfully for Makoto Shinkai, it's a shtick that's sort of universal, and all of us can understand and relate to.

That shtick is talking about the relations between people by way of the *distance* between them. Reminds me of Georg Simmel's dyadic nature of things. Distance is what defines how close we are to one another.

It truly felt like a Hollywood RomCom, sans the ending, except it was shorter. We've had moments, and we've had some words, and for each minute spent on something, a RomCom film would've spent 3-5, for much of the film. And yet, I found myself smiling, or thinking that things felt real enough.

The movie is called "The Garden of Words", and in some ways it's almost like we've seen a montage, rather than actually seeing things acted out, but though it was somewhat sparse and austere, it felt as if nothing was missing. Makoto Shinkai gives us human relationships, but rather than dwell on each moment, he shows us a beautiful series of shots, and lets the distance between the characters, and the distance between us and them, tie it all together.

It still feels a bit sparse, even as nothing is missing. I smiled, and I kept tearing up. It was more drama than a RomCom, especially as there was nothing comic about it, but RomComs are often not truly comic or romantic to begin with. I had a hard time calling it as a 7/10 film or 8/10 film, so I just gave it 7.5/10.

**Haibane Renmei Episodes 7-13 (Complete):**

Before we move on, here are [my notes for episodes 7-9](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/26mmva/anime_club_watch_18_haibane_renmei_79_spoilers/), and [here for episodes 10-13](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/26z3rq/anime_club_watch_18_haibane_renmei_1013_spoilers/chvvu80).

These episodes had been the pay-off. Where before we explored the world some, it was so we'd have what to lose, and then the show's true themes came to light, themes of loss and grief, depression and community. Everything in this show is about community - grief is the loss of a community member, depression is being unable to feel as part of the community, and forgiveness and salvation is to see yourself as part of the community, and to feel forgiven by it.

It was a good show, in terms of plot-construction. Nothing came out of nowhere, and it all made sense when it appeared. It posed questions, you answered them based on what you had seen thus far, and then the characters had provided the same answers. That's not a bad thing, but shows that the progression had been natural. It also meant that there wasn't much surprise or suspense, though there had been some suspense - knowing what the options are, and even seeing all the characters say the right thing doesn't mean they'd choose to *do* the right thing.

This isn't really a plot-heavy series, and likewise, the world isn't at the center of it all, even though the series is called "Haibane Renmei", where the Renmei organization is an ever looming presence, rather than an active force. I also find it hard to call it a "character-driven" series, for the "protagonist" plays the role of a classic supporting character, shedding light on others' personalities, and chiefly Reki's.

So what is this story about? It's a story about finding one's place in the world, about loss and grieving. It also has a moral, where to be alive, and to be forgiven, are a result of a communal existence. Man cannot exist on his own. You can see the second half of the show as an exploration of grief and depression, and it makes a statement on how to get out, and how the depression itself makes you unable to accept that way out.

I think I might have liked Haibane Renmei a lot more as a book. Haibane Renmei is very much, to me, not about how good you think they treat their theme, but how much it resonates with you when you watch it. I know times in the past it'd have resonated with me much more strongly, but not this time. A lot of what an anime of Haibane Renmei could bring over a book would be its OST, which was good but sparse and subdued, and its voice-acting, which was *very* subdued. The acting and drama of the finale were spectacular, but it was just one episode.

---

I also read the 130th Chihayafuru chapter. Reading one manga chapter at a time truly is suffering.
>> ARTICLE
>I think I might have liked Haibane Renmei a lot more as a book.

I dunno if you're aware of it, but 'Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World' is a Haruki Murakami book which has two stories, and one of them [End of the World] closely resembles Haibane Renmei and ABe has said before that he drew a LOT inspiration from that story.

I haven't read it myself [I plan to], so I can't vouch for how good it is, but maybe give it a shot if you really think you'd like the story in written form? ^ ^
>> ARTICLE
I own that book, and I've heard of that! I hadn't read it yet, so I'll probably bump it up a bit. But I wonder if that'd work, as Haruki Murakami's style isn't one I think of as especially conducive to what I think of :)

Also, it's less the story that I'd have liked more, but the emotional impact? The best thing an anime/show can have over a book is the voice acting and sound to help imbue it with feeling, but if they don't, then imagination can reign supreme.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Kokoro Connect.
>> ARTICLE
How was it, without spoiling anything? I was thinking about watching it earlier this week but didn't have enough time.
>> ARTICLE
It has a lot of twists and the way they delve into the characters problems is great.
>> ARTICLE
It was pretty good, lots of drama, great character development, a little romance, I enjoyed it. I'd had it on my to-watch list for a while, glad I decided to watch it finally.
>> ARTICLE
One of my all time favorite animes. There are 4 episodes after the main 13  of the show that a lot of ppl miss and they're incredible.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. The last 4 episodes changed my life.
>> ARTICLE
I'm genuinely curious, in what way have those episodes changed your life? 

I loved Kokoro Connect but it never had that kind of impact on me, so I wonder.
>> ARTICLE
I'm basically Iori. The way she reacted to everything, her words, her emotions, I fully resonated with throughout the whole series, especially the last 4 episodes. The cheerful loving exterior, the dark brooding self-condemning perfectionist interior.

Her resolution at the end was mine as well, but unfortunately it's a lesson I seem to have to learn over and over again throughout my life. The darkness inside seems to reach a new level the older I get.
>> ARTICLE
Woah I totally forgot about how heavy Iori's story was. One the one hand it's great that you can connect (heh) to the character so much, on the other hand I hope you can find a permanent solution soon and get better.

The characters I could relate the most to were how Inaba acted on the outside and Aoki in general. So... I don't seem to have troubles like you have, which is good for me I guess. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched [Mouretsu Pirates](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8917/Mouretsu_Pirates). **26/26** in a couple of days.

There isn't much to say about it besides it was a very entertaining anime. 

The main character was was very likable, she wasn't annoying in anyway and she was pretty capable which was nice to see. Also the character [Chiaki](http://myanimelist.net/character/49873/Chiaki_Kurihara) reminded me so much of Kuroneko from Oriemo. I couldn't help but think of her as Space Pirate Kuroneko. I guess it has something to do with the same VA, hairstyle and even similar personality's. 

There wasn't to much of a main story, kind of little arcs all over the place, some pretty laid back while others very interesting and highly entertaining. Basically the main character in space, being a space pirate and doing pirating jobs, while also trying to keep up with school and all the other things she does.

It also had a great [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcBXhDCQNJE), at first i didn't really like it, but i always watch the first 3 episodes without skipping op's and ed's. By the time the 4th one came around it had grown on me and i didn't end up skipping it once.

Over all a decent sci-fi/space anime. [Couldn't](http://i.imgur.com/qXMmb3S.jpg) get [enough](http://i.imgur.com/PSf5WMK.jpg) of those [Pirate](http://i.imgur.com/X0ZNr3F.jpg) [uniforms](http://i.imgur.com/ktyrKbv.jpg). I'm definitely looking forward to the Movie when ever it comes out on BD and gets subbed. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the pirate uniforms are awesome. Only the hacking fights are more awesome imo.
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching Nichijou, its pretty ridiculous

Oh and steins;gate. 
>> ARTICLE
oh wow. I watched steins;gate a couple weeks ago, then afterwards i watched nichijou, just finished it up. Are we the same person? O.o
>> ARTICLE
Blame the D-mail
>> ARTICLE
>Oh and steins;gate

Did you just demote Steins;Gate to footnote status?! Naw it's cool, you're gonna really have fun with that one.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm only 6 episodes in, so who am I to say.
>> ARTICLE
Just make sure to stick around until around episode 10 where things really start happening
>> ARTICLE
14 episodes in...... holy fuck.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I actually started watching it when it started and 7 episodes in dropped it because it was so boring. Finally got around to watching it like 2 years later because I finally got swayed by the "it gets better" comment people always made and ended up being glad I did. I really wish they could have done something to make the beginning a bit less boring though.

Selamat pagi!

Selamat malaam.

I started watching [Uchouten Kazoku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17909/Uchouten_Kazoku) (5/13) .

I'm around episode 5 now and I like it. It has a certain charm to it, I don't know. It looks well, characters are nice, it's just relaxing. I've seen people claim this was the best anime of the year, but I'm not entirely convinced. I'm positive about it so far though.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just a frog in a well that knows nothing of the sea.
>> ARTICLE
I started this as well. Awesome show so far. It has some of the most entertaining and well written characters I've seen recently.
>> ARTICLE
I watched that last week, and it definitely took me a few episodes to really get interested in the show. I think you'll hit that point within the next episode or two, because the last half of the show is fantastic. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I'm getting excited. It's just that I can't watch it here, or I would've continued right away. Soon I will watch it though, I'll try remembering to post about it next week.

**K-On! 9-13, Completed**

I talked about this last week, but I finally finished season 1! It was so adorable, and I ended up giving it a 9/10, heh.

**K-On!! 15/26**

After finishing the first season, I immediately started the second. It's still just cute girls being cute, so it's just as (if not more) enjoyable than the first season.

**Nisemonogatari 10/11**

As I explained in the week prior to this, my friend and I watch one episode of an anime series a day since I'm trying to get him into watching anime again. So, we picked the monogatari series and we're almost done with Nisemonogatari.~ Yay!

**Unbreakable Machine Doll 3/12**

The main reason why I picked this up is because of Yaya. She's so cute. I kept hearing mixed reviews on it, so I decided to watch it myself and make my own decisions. While I'm only on episode 3 (since I've been devoting most of my time to finishing up K-On!! and watching the currently airing shows), I still find this show pretty enjoyable.

**Fate/Zero 3/25**

Well, I said I would pick this up after finishing up Psycho-Pass since I enjoyed that show so much. I can't really say much about Fate/Zero yet, because I'm still very very early on in the series, however, I do enjoy it so far! The animation/art-style is gorgeous, it really is a pleasing show to watch. I'll probably be finishing it within this week or the next!

Once I finish watching one of these shows, I think I'm going to be moving on to either **Code Geass** or **Mirai Nikki**.~
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero  Great anime, dat ending doe, to gud 

As someone who only watches anime that comes on Netflix, or it gets enough traction for me to hear about it all.  I really enjoyed the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Oh dude Mirai Nikki is god tier, please watch it before Geass.
>> ARTICLE
So jealous that you get to watch Mirai Nikki for the first time, maker sure you really don't look up anything and spoil it for yourself
>> ARTICLE
I've resorted to making people watch this anime just so I can steal some of their "watching Mirai Nikki for the first time" emotions.
>> ARTICLE
Thankfully nothing major has been spoiled for me yet!

Now I'm excited to watch it, though! I've never heard anything bad about it and it's been recommended to me quite a few times.
>> ARTICLE
Curious, how (and why) do you decide which episode to watch next, when watching so many different shows that already ended?

I used to read multiple books concurrently, but when I watch anime that ended not as part of the watch club, I try to finish or drop one before moving to the next.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if he does the same thing I do, but even if I'm bored with a show, I don't want to stop watching it in case it does get good.

So once I get bored with an anime I move onto the next, leaving the first for another time.
>> ARTICLE
I used to be the same way, actually. Watching too many things at once drove me crazy. But eventually I would maybe watch two shows at a time, and became used to it. Then I'd add another one and become used to that, etc. But, I'm pretty much at my limit for now with the shows I'm watching. 4 different series that have ended + the 10 or so shows that I'm watching & are airing are enough for me. If I added anything else, I think I would have a heart-attack.

When it comes to how/why, it simply comes down to what I feel like I want to watch when I have extra time. All of the shows I'm watching are very different from each other, making it easy to pick based on what I feel like watching. If I'm feeling something filled with action - Fate/Zero. If I want to watch something cute that doesn't require much attention - K-On.~
>> ARTICLE
Making my way through Stand Alone Complex. God damn. (Then Love Live after I finish all of the GitS series.)
>> ARTICLE
GitS:SAC is a fantastic series. Be sure to stick around for 2nd Gig (season 2), which if anything is even better than the first season. I watched the original Ghost in the Shell (1995) movie yesterday, and it didn't really do it for me the way SAC did. It was weird seeing Kusanagi with black hair and blue eyes, and her English voice actor was horrible compared to SAC's Kusanagi. Also, CGI from 20 years ago wasn't great, apparently in the future we still only know how to make green displays.
>> ARTICLE
I finished FMA Brotherhood yesterday. 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching Psycho Pass. My god this show is great. 


>> ARTICLE
How far in are you? Once you get at least half-way through you get to see a lot of really interesting George Orwell level shit. Fitting how Makishima always seems to have a copy of dystopian future books from 1984 to Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
>> ARTICLE
I finished the series a few hours after posting about it
>> ARTICLE
i can not wait for the second season and movie.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still blaming myself for not watching it earlier (currently addicted to it)
>> ARTICLE
What kind of show is it? It looks really interesting, but I'm not quite the fan of shows that rely too much on action. Does it have more to offer than that?
>> ARTICLE
If it means anything to you, it's a Urobuchi show.
>> ARTICLE
I looked it up and found he wrote the script for Madoka. I loved Madoka, so I guess that does mean at least something.

I'm going to finish Uchouten Kazoku first and I'll give at least the first three episodes a try.
>> ARTICLE
Urobuchi's shows always boast strong writing, I'd further mention you consider Fate/Zero if you haven't before, and further praise Psycho Pass. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more mystery-esque driven than action driven. But it's definitely worth a watch when you have spare time, and there's a second season coming soon.
>> ARTICLE
To aru Kagaku no railgun S
On episode 13 and it's so intense I love this world and the characters I never want the anime to end. 

Boku wa tomodachi ga sukunia
One of the most enjoyable anime I have ever watched. On episode  8 right meow
>> ARTICLE
Started watching Fate/Zero and Gurren Lagaan after them sitting on my HDD for ever. Man, they are both a blast. Fate has been especially enjoyable simply because of how gorgeous it is. Definitely makes me glad I have a large tv to watch anime on.

>> ARTICLE
Watched sora no woto and it was great the music direction was phenomenal and the glimpses of the world as shown were highly intriguing. Now started onto Kara no Kyoukai (2/7) and so far it's every pretty and highly enjoyable 
>> ARTICLE
I'm still catching up on shows that finished airing last season.

[Hoozuki no Reitetsu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20431/Hoozuki_no_Reitetsu) - Complete

This was the winter 2014 anime I was the most excited for before the season, looking at promo art and reading descriptions. Then it started airing, and people didn't seem to like it very much. Then it ended up outselling all other anime last season, but the impression I got from others was that it required a ton of cultural knowledge about Japan to "get" it. So when I started watching it last week I didn't expect to like it all that much, since I don't exactly pride myself with having incredible knowledge about Japan. I just watch anime.

It was indeed a very Japanese show, and a lot of the jokes did indeed go straight over my head, and only had some vague recollection of most of the legends the anime joked with. However, I really did enjoy the characters, and the jokes I did get I thought to be for the most part cleverly written. I am almost done with catching up on the winter 2014 anime, and as it stands this is actually one of my favorites

[Mikakunin de Shinkoukei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20541/Mikakunin_de_Shinkoukei) - Complete

Can't say I had much expectations going into this one, and I was pretty much ready to drop it after 3 episodes. But I decided to press on, and was rewarded with a middle part I really enjoyed, before it all kinda fizzled out in some mediocre final episodes. Before starting the anime I was not aware of the supernatural elements, so that came as a nice surprise. I really like the idea of mixing slice of life with supernatural/fantasy, but I also tend to have really high expectations for anime I know have the SoL/supernatural mix, and often end up disappointed. With this show it came as a total surprise, and ended up in my eyes being a nice spice to an otherwise rather mundane anime.

[Gundam Build Fighters](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19319/Gundam_Build_Fighters) - 16/25

All Gundam anime are pretty much just glorified toy commercials, and Gundam Build Fighters takes that aspect to new heights. I'm not 10 years old, and I'm not a exactly a huge fan of the Gundam franchise or a toy geek, yet for some reason I'm still really enjoying Build Fighters. Sunrise has done a really good job with making an anime that appeals to children, hardcore gundam fans, and at the same time roping more people into the fandom.
>> ARTICLE
Started watching Code Geass (10/26). Someone recommended it to me because I liked Guilty Crown and man do the two shows seem similar. Nevertheless, I'm enjoying it so far.
>> ARTICLE
IMO Code Geass goes way further with the greyed out societal ideals and develops a really memorable social/political commentary. It's also extremely fabulous
>> ARTICLE
Guilty Crown stole from Code Geass pretty heavily. If you liked Guilty Crown, you should love Code Geass. Also, FYI there are two seasons of the show. The total episode count is much higher than 26.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Toradora yesterday. Taiga is probably my favorite tsundere character ever. I recently finished Love, Chunibyo and other Delusions and adored that too. Now I am wanting something completely different so I am watching Another. It is amazing so far. 
>> ARTICLE
I finished Madoka and Space Dandy.

Madoka surprised me, I thought it would just ride the Dark Magical Girl thing the whole way, but it was genuinely good. Ending was all right, expected a little more I guess, but it is by no means bad.

Space Dandy was awesome. Totally my thing, such wildly different episodes. A few of them felt like they would be right at home in Cowboy Bebop. A ridiculously fun show, I am looking forward to season 2.
>> ARTICLE
You should definitely watch the 3rd Madoka movie which continues the series and is pretty much a "WTF did I just watch" thing. 
>> ARTICLE
I finished Shiki last week, and am kinda determined to be current on Sword Art Online before season 2 comes out, meaning this was a **Sword Art Online** weekend, complete with three new episode writeups!

[Sword Art Online 10](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/05/29/sword-art-online-episode-10/)

[Sword Art Online 11](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/05/31/sword-art-online-episode-11/)

[Sword Art Online 12](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/06/01/sword-art-online-episode-12/)

It's been an adventure! The confrontation with Kuradeel and the introduction of Yui mark the series' two lowest points so far, but it's actually been quite enjoyable in spite of that, and the writeups are a lot of fun. The conventional wisdom is that the second half is where it "gets bad," so I'm kinda excited to get to that, but I'm already having a good, silly time with this first arc.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say it gets bad, but rather that it gets worse. The first arc of SAO has a lot of strong points, but loses a few of them in the 2nd one. The arc is still good in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I think structurally, the Fairy Dance arc is actually stronger than the first in a lot of ways. It just gets exponentially more ~light novel~ as it goes on. 
>> ARTICLE
That would not surprise me. This first arc's structure is one of its most glaring weaknesses.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Fate/Zero. 
Loved every bit of it! I was a little lost concerning the ending though... 

And I recently started watching Bakemonogatari, it seems very promising! 
>> ARTICLE
The reason you would feel a little lost is because, Like me, you probably didn't know it was a prequel to an already existing anime. Fate/Stay night.

Unless in which case you did know, then I have no idea XD
>> ARTICLE
I finished **Samurai Deeper Kyo** yesterday. The show felt rushed and mediocre. I plan on reading the manga because I heard that the anime cut some stuff out and made it more kid friendly. 

Now I'm watching **Moblie Sut Gundam Wing (5/49)**. So far, so good. My first Gundam series. Seems like a nice place to start.

**Patema Inverted** - 7/10
___

So a few of my friends and I groupwatched this movie yesterday and it was a pretty fun time. The cast is pretty likable, albeit silly. The plot is slightly ridiculous. The comedic timing is infinitely better than most actual comedies I watch. 

The real star of the show is the cinematography. The combination of the gorgeous backgrounds with fantastic shots where they flipped the picture over to see the other point of view was absolutely amazing. I would watch a montage of all those scenes in a heartbeat.

Anyway it was a pretty standard movie. I would show it to even people who aren't fans of anime happily. It's by no means amazing or even great, but it's an enjoyable use of about 2 hours. Kids would probably like it a lot even though the concepts are somewhat more mature than the average kids show or movie.
>> ARTICLE
I actually watched this just 5 minutes ago... I would give it a 9.5/10, but I tend to rate more on how enjoyable it was rather than an objective 'this art was good'/'this story was good'.
>> ARTICLE
**Mononoke 6/10** (12/12) 

This was a big disappointment for me, I loved the art but after the first arc (I suppose the first Bakeneko arc was technically a prequel) the arcs got less interesting and less coherent. Maybe I just don't have the head to follow along with its artsy storytelling but after the end of every arc I only had a general understanding of wtf happened and was left confused.

I would have dropped it around episode 5/6 but the art kept me watching and although it wasn't able to carry the show the fact that it kept me around until the end says a lot. Very colourful.

**Daily lives of highschool boys 6/10** (9/12)

Again this was a disappointment for, I think if an anime wants to get by on 100% comedy then it needs to be *reeeeaally* funny for me to enjoy but the majority of gags in this weren't for me and even the ones I did kind of like weren't very funny. Whats considered funny tends to be very different from person to person though so oh well.

**Gintama 8/10** (113/201)

I'm really enjoying this, a lot of the episodes aren't very funny but at this point I've got really attached to the characters so even when it's not very funny I can still really enjoy it as an episodic series. Some of the other episodes are absolutely hilarious, episode 89 (I think) with the soul of Gintokis sword trying to teach him a special technique because the anime had been running for 2 years was great and a really clever/funny parody of the shounen genre.

What I like the most though are the serious arcs, even the silly ones tend to have a proper underlying story behind the wacky-ness which is great but the ones that get really serious I tend to enjoy the most.

I really hope theres more fights like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijx7Oy1l_0c) (Spoilers maybe)

I think by the time I finish this up it'll be a 9/10.

[I was reading the manga for **Ikoku Meiro no Croise \(Croise in a Foreign Labyrinth\)** when I saw an insert page showing it had an anime.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9938/Ikoku_Meiro_no_Crois%C3%A9e) I promptly dropped everything and started watching it. Currently 4 episodes in!

So, the show's a weird half-breed of historical fiction with little hints of iyashikei moe action. Yes, it is better than that description would imply, especially if your tastes are anything like mine are. This is the story of Yune, a tiny Japanese girl who emigrates to France in the late 1880's and so lives with temperamental Claude and his playboy grandfather Oscar, helping them tend to Claude's failing ironworks business in the less trendy part of Paris. 

The show lacks a lot of the typical anime-isms that seem to characterize so much of modern slice-of-life, being significantly more akin to *Usagi Drop* and *Silver Spoon* than to, say, *GJ-bu* or *Acchi Kocchi.* Character interactions are natural and, most importantly, human ([well,](http://i.imgur.com/lbPh7q8.png) for [the](http://i.imgur.com/io8xiwc.png) most [part.](http://i.imgur.com/k7E5ZeY.png)) While the actual character depth is merely serviceable (I doubt anyone from this show will be memorable), the show does explore the idea of adapting to a changing world, through the eyes of Yune and Claude - there is obviously Yune coming to terms with living in as alien a place as Paris, and Claude trying to keep his father business alive in the face of changing times, where blacksmiths like him are being increasingly shut out and small businesses are being phased out in favor of malls and department stores.

...And before someone asks, [there is no lolicon in this story](http://i.imgur.com/kjtJwBi.jpg). Sorry to burst your bubble, but Claude's relationship with Yune is strictly fatherly.

The art and music direction here are pretty good. I mean, [look](http://i.imgur.com/qP4AT3p.png) [at](http://i.imgur.com/5aoHN4y.png) [these](http://i.imgur.com/K6qehBY.png) [shots](http://i.imgur.com/iolmbUg.png), dammit! In particular, those shots from episode 3 of Yune in the rain really emphasized how foreign she is to Paris, how her bright red umbrella and the click-clack of her geta made her stick out from the drab, murky and silent crowd around her. It's not an original trick, but it's certainly affective. 

I was so impressed with the sound and writing, in fact, that I looked up who the sound guy was. And wouldn't you know it, it's Junichi Sato! In case you don't know him (I'm sure /u/Novasylum does), he's work on:

- Director for *Aria the Animation, the Origination,* and *the Natural*, as well as sound director and writer 

- Director for *Sailor Moon, Sailor Moon R,* and *Sailor Moon S*, as well as occasional storyboarder.

- Director for *Princess Tutu*

- Creator, director, writer for *Tamayura*

That's a pretty impressive resume, and I only listed the most famous stuff he was heavily involved in. And that experience really shows here - *Ikoku Meiro no Croisee* is a lot better than I expected.  

Also still juggling ***Psycho-Pass (06/22)*** and ***xxxHolic Kei (8/13)***; those are my next priority once I finish *Croisee.*

**Ashita no Joe**, ~50 to 64. I can't say much without spoiling everything, but it's set to be one of my favourite anime. I find it very easy to get invested in the characters, and the pacing is close to perfect.

I think it stands up well visually even compared to anime decades younger, although its strengths lie mainly in layouts. The art itself is dated, but I'm not put off by it. 

The sound is good, too. Tange's voice actor did a fantastic job, and he has some really emotive scenes. Some of the other characters sound a bit too provincial, which is quite jarring after listening to the very manufactured voices of seiyuu today. The OST is used well, and there are several memorable themes for each character. The [ED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBKB0Ufu7ic) is often used as an insert song, to good effect. 

The only problem I have with it is the presence of the children. A little comic relief is fine, but their voices are so shrill that listening to them is a pain in itself. And they're usually there for just a little longer than I feel necessary, too.

>> ARTICLE
Strike witches, the whole franchise. It was a series I felt was honest and genuinely likeable. It's like a grilled cheese sandwich. Classic recipe, prepared well could also be a masterpiece. No fancy tricks or plot twists. Really a simple down to earth series. But it was executed really nicely.

Lovable memorable characters. Enjoyable pacing. Great atmosphere. Cool setting. Boobs.

The movie was great too. I'd say possibly the best of the series.

Now I'm just eagerly awaiting S3 and the OVA.

**FLCL** 5/6

This show is... interesting. *I think* it is attempting to be some sort of commentary on the introduction of consumerism and consumerist culture. Besides the enormous factory that visually dominates the town, the robot is appliance-like and when asked Naota's father calls it "the tv"/"a walk man". The relationship between Naota and the robot also seems to suggest this. There is an irony in the way that the robot literally consumes Naota to power up, which perhaps is supposed to represent how consumers are consumed themselves by their own desire. Also some of the conversations that Naota has seem to suggest that there is the illusion that Naota is in control when he merges with the robot but in fact the opposite is true and the robot is merely using him. Though... Naota himself doesn't seem to have any particular desire for the robot. In addition, the multitude of other appliances coming out of Naota's head again would seem to suggest that they are the results on industry forcing their way into his life, and yet the large one tries to destroy the factory. So this whole theory is probably completely full of shit and I don't really have any idea what is going on with Mamimi or why the "enemies" all look like hands or basically anything else that is going on in this show. 

Though aside from my infantile attempts to analyze what FLCL is trying to say (if it's trying to say anything at all), the story itself is a bit too bizarre to be engaging on its own. I do have a a soft spot for stylistically unique and interesting things, but this one hasn't really done it for me.

**Clannad** 22/22

Clannad is *just* funny and emotional enough that I would recommend it to others. I hear that After Story is much better and an entirely different animal. So, I'm definitely going to check that out though I would be completely uninterested if it was just more of the same.

       
>> ARTICLE
Hey if you even thought Clannad was bearable, you'll love After Story. Just adding my encouragement for you to watch it, don't stop now!
>> ARTICLE
This is not necessarily true. I liked Clannad, but I couldn't even finish After Story. Nothing that I liked in Clannad was in After Story, and everything that I disliked stayed. Except the parents. The parents were cool. 
>> ARTICLE
After story went up and down a lot for me, I kept thinking something I liked was *about* to happen, but it never did. A lot of people throw it out as the go-to heart-wrenching tear-jerker but I just couldn't get that into it. 

I really liked the OVA with Tomoyo though, that one gut my feels.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same about Clannad, but After Story is really great if you atleast enjoyed Clannad a bit.
>> ARTICLE
After Story is a completely different beast from Clannad, although it does start off the same. You get 12 more episodes of character building before the rails come off and Shit Gets Seriously Real. Yet I'm one of the odd ones around here, as I actually liked Clannad more than I did After Story. I think it's partly because I've been part of... Well, I won't give anything away, but an old therapist of mine laughed a bit more than necessary when I compared my life to being Wile E. Coyote trapped in an anvil factory. I think that Tomoya would have agreed.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped all of the stuff on my backlog and I'm working on what I appear to enjoy most. I couldn't get into Fate/Stay Night at all and I'm hoping that changes with the new anime, so I started Fate/Zero last night. Even the first episode has me far more interested than anything else I could've hoped to like about Stay Night. 
>> ARTICLE
You shouldn't be watching Fate/stay, you should be playing the visual novel if you really want to enjoy it. Most people will tell you the same thing, the anime version is much more inferior than the visual novel, although you might want to know the VN has nsfw material.

**Berserk 25/25**

This show blew my god damn mind. It was great, everything I wanted from it. I wish there was more of the anime, but it introduced me into the universe and made me immediately pick up the manga and start it. 

**Nichijou 26/26** 

Hilarious. This show had me laughing quite a lot. Slice of Life for me is hard to watch, but Nichijou kept me hooked and wanting to see more.

**Monogatari Series: Second Season 1/26**

Don't have much to say about this show as of now. Having Senjou and Hanekawa together will hopefully be fun, and I hope this show holds up.

Just Finished [**Kaiba**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3701/Kaiba).


It was fantastic. The visuals remind kind of remind me of the Ralph Bakshi movie Wizards, and each episode was really well written. It was sad and confusing, but it all started to make sense close to the end and the plot really came together. It was short, enjoyable and the characters were all really interesting. What I liked most about it was the very different character designs. 



One of my few gripes about the show is that I still don't understand some things about it, and if I had the time I'd rewatch it so I can fully understand it or speculate on what was going on.



[**Death Billiards**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14353/Death_Billiards) was also awesome. In 20 minutes, it set up interesting, sympathetic characters and a really unique situation. It's only one episode, go watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Well last week I watched Yozakura Quartet ~Hana no Uta~. It was certainly good, but it ended way too early, and I can't help but feel based on the fact that this was a retelling that it may not get a second season. I could read the Manga, but I'm so lazy. I don't like reading manga because if it does get animated it ruins the anime for me, because I notice all the differences and I already know what's going to happen. 

I also watched Welcome to the NHK a while back and I didn't ever get a chance to talk about it the last couple threads. I'd seen it recommended a few times around here, that it was sort of a motivational anime. But, while I can understand why someone might feel motivated by that, I didn't. The sort of message that I got was "Abandon your dreams because real life's not like that" And that may or may not be solid advice, it's not really motivational, quite the opposite in fact. The main character was really more unlikeable than relatable, but he was also really realistic in some regards, I don't think a lot of shows really nail how anxiety attacks affect people Like Welcome to the NHK did.

Another small gripe I have with it is (And this is the first time I've really been bothered by it, I'm usually quite laid back in this regard) acting. [Finale Spoilers](/s "Misaki's in particular. While she delivered her lines really well in the last scene with the suicide and sobbing and crazy freakout that happened, the very next scene where they were leaving she delivered her lines in the EXACT same cheerful way she had been talking throughout the entire series. ARE YOU NOT AT ALL SHAKEN BY THIS? YOU NEARLY KILLED YOURSELF. AND THEN HE NEARLY KILLED *HIM*SELF. IS THIS AN EVERYDAY THING THAT YOU CAN BRUSH OFF EASILY?") I don't know, I'm kind of exaggerating my frustration from that, but it really just killed my immersion. 

Welcome to the NHK is, unfortunately, not something I can unconditionally recommend.
>> ARTICLE
I hope you watched Yozakura Quartet: Hoshi no Umi, because otherwise you've missed a chunk of the story.

I didn't. D: I'll have to do that then.
>> ARTICLE
After you're done with that, you might give [Kyousou Giga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_%28TV%29) a try. The style of it is very similar to Yozakura Quartet, but unlike Yozakura Quartet I would classify Kyousougiga as more of an experience rather than anything else. Anyway, give it a try if you ever find time, it's very interesting to say the least.

**Date A Live OVA (1/1)** 

Okay, this was hilarious. I love this show. On to season 2.

**Code Geass R2 (10/25)** (Watched 6-10 this week)

Definitely digging this more than R1. I'm excited to watch more. Lelouch is crazy at escaping.

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica Movie 1**

This was good, but it cut too much from the series in my opinion. I prefer the series even with it's lesser quality of animation. 

I'm watching so many currently airing shows it's not even funny. I need to work on my backlog more.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!: Ren 12/12**
I really liked the first season, it was funny, it was cute, it actually had character development and it had a satisfying ending.  When I heard there was a second season I was a bit skeptical and I think rightfully so.  The second season was reasonably enjoyable but I felt like there wasn't enough development over all 12 episodes and the ending was extremely unsatisfying.

**Kokoro Connect 17/17**
I was blown away by this show, I got a recommendation since I like romantic slice of life type anime and I was a bit skeptical.  But I think I would rank this one a very close second to Steins;Gate in terms of the best anime I have seen so far.  It might be because I can identify with all of the characters in some aspect, but this show will certainly stay with me.  Its definitely one of those shows that I wish I could just erase my memory of it and watch it over again, just to experience it for the first time again.

**Seitokai Yakuindomo Season 2 5/12**
This is the anime I've been watching to take the edge off the feels from other anime I've been watching.  So far season 2 has been just ok compared to the first one, the visuals seem to have gotten a lot better but it just isn't as laugh out loud funny as the first season to me.

I've really only recently gotten back into anime and I'm always looking for new stuff to watch.  I'm really looking for character driven anime, shows with great characters and character development.  But maybe something with a little less feels than Kokoro Connect, I think I need to watch something a bit more upbeat now.
>> ARTICLE
Re:Chunibyo, makes me glad I dropped Ren two episodes in.  I was completely disappointed that all the development that had happened in season 1 was completely undone.  Rikka and Dekomori are still hopeless chunibyo, and Nibutani is still a conniving bitch... even though they had all grown past that by the last season finale.  Made me feel like my investment isn't worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if I agree that they had grown past being chunibyo, [Spoiler](/s "part of the ending to to the first season was Yuuta accepting Rikka for who she was and to stop trying to change her.")  And there are some moments in Ren that feel like its the same show as the first season but its a bit of a shadow of the first season.  That being said I still enjoyed it and depending on how much you enjoyed the first season, I would still say its worth finishing if you liked the first season.  But I think its also understandable to not want to finish it because its honestly not nearly as good as the first season.

**Bakemonogatari: Completed**

Started of boring, 4 episodes in and thinking on dropping it, I was not used to Shaft and their ridiculous long dialogues that contribute almost nothing but to fill the character. Then Hachikuji (she actually appeared in episode 3-4) appeared, then Kanbaru and finally Hanekawa which was my least favorite until Monogatari Second Season. Then I realised it was just a collection of stories, with a nice, funny, molester as a main character. Not to mention I still have that Sengoku OP in my head.

**Nisemonogatori: Completed**

The sisters chronicles, I was waiting for the ecchi to come and fill me up. But the highlight of course, would be Kaiki. He just for the first dialogue with Araragi quickly became my favourite character, curse that lovable con-man. 

**Nekomonogatori: Black: Completed**

My least favourite, but I got to know Hanekawa better, but I only could relate with her in the second season. 

**Monogatari Second Season: Completed**

In 2 days, favourite arcs Sengoku arc and the Kaiki arc were my favourites. The first Hanekawa arc was better than I was expecting, [](/s "she got better, maybe it was the hair upgrade and probably the state of her family too and her background"). [](/s "Time travel arc, I'm sorry but doing all that just for homework Araragi, makes me wonder if you ended up by doing the homework.")

Next up the Nadeko Sengoku arc, she got better as a character in my opinion and the end just proved that [](/s "sometimes Araragi himself is not part of the solution but a problem. In the end I related to her simply because of one detail: the complements, listening to the same complement over and over again, starts from being a good thing into a bad thing, that one starts to think if the others look at our other sides and then she flips and that's brilliant.")

Let's skip the next, black void/loli arc, I cried, also a little grossed out by that kiss. 

Kaiki arc, by far my favourite, simply because I liked the character ever since he appeared. Everything is brilliant here, the opening, the monologues, his personality and his view as a con-man, on analysing people and the situation, the complete opposite of the main character in personality and in his ideals, [](/s "in the end, as one was able to save Nadeko the other was able to save Senjouhara, a thing one or the other couldn't do.")

I've lost a lot of precious study time, it was worth it though (not really I'm screwed).

**Plastic Nee-san**: **COMPLETE**

Honestly, this show is practically unreviewable for me. Not because it was completely awful or anything. Far from it. Instead, it was 24 minutes of excessively hyper animation that went smoothly from craziness to insanity with only enough of a gap to let you catch your breath from laughing so fucking hard.

Rating: **8/10**  
Recommendation level: People with souls  

**Koi Kaze**: **COMPLETE**  

I had a number of problems with this show. Not the incest, because I was ready for it. And I definitely did not have any problems with the girl, as Kohinata Nanoka was absolutely adorable even with her (understandable) brother-complex. I would have wanted to take her home to meet my grandmother if I had known her when I was 15 years old. (My grandmother approved of nobody I knew.) 

(Actually, I take that back. She approved of Christina. The only problem with Christina was that she absolutely did not like boys. At all. Especially not that way. But she didn't want to disappoint either my grandmother or her father or anybody else in the church. So we pretended to date for 4 months until they were satisfied with our progress and then had a long month of nothing but inconsequential and fake fights that led to our eventual "breaking up". Last I heard from her, she is still exceptionally happily married to her wife somewhere in the back-woods of Vermont. As always, names have been changed to protect the guilty.) (By the way, while I'm on the subject of parentheticals, I wonder if anyone actually reads these side comments of mine... It's okay if you don't. I'm used to it. No, really. I'm used to it.) 

Instead, my problems came from all of the men in this anime. Because for a seinen anime, you'd think that the men would be the understandable and happy ones, wouldn't you? But no. Odagiri was just a straight-up perverted asshole who served no purpose, and I always wanted to choke him by the neck until his eyes bugged out. The father was a much older and more weepy version of what I always pictured Okazaki Tomoka turning into when Ushio got older, and there wasn't a scene that went by that I didn't feel the urge to whack him upside the head with a 4x4. 

And then we get to the crown prince of the show... Sekai Koshiro himself. He was a gigantic cunt from start to finish. He was a cunt to his father when Nanoka moved in. He was a cunt to Nanoka until the day he moved out. He was a cunt to Chidori Kaname (who really did want to date Koshiro for real) except for that six-week span when he wasn't near his sister. He was even a cunt to his ex-girlfriend, when she obviously wanted to try the relationship all over again. He was *really* a cunt when he quit his job just so he wouldn't have to run into Kaname again. 

Koshiro was just a man-child who couldn't be honest with himself about anything. I just can't help but to think that, if he just hadn't been such a brooding idiot, he would have had a normal life with a normal family and with a little sister who still worshiped the ground he walked on. And if he could have just been capable of having a normal bone in his body, I might not have loathed him quite so much. 

Honestly, Japan... Can we get an incest fantasy anime where I actually *don't* hate the main character? 

Rating: **6/10**  
Recommendation level: Guys who never had a little sister.

Just finished nisekoi after 3 days. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this series. Will probably read the manga since the the ending felt unfinished. Although there will probably be a second season eventually. I give it solid 8/10.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to warn you right now if you plan to get into the manga, the plot hasn't advanced very far.  There's been a lot of chapters devoted solely to character development, and some of them don't even do anything new for the characters.  They're all a fun read, but if you're expecting to advance really far, you might get a bit frustrated with them.
>> ARTICLE
Well I've only read about 20 chapters after where the anime left off and even though not much has really happened, I don't mind the extra character development. I think it's enjoyable to see the details. I honestly don't care who Ichijo ends up with since I like all of them. XD

Started watching Steins;Gate, I'm about 10 episodes in. So far I can say I love the humor and the characters, and the show overall is really enjoyable, but the last few episodes I watched makes it seem like things are about to get serious. I'm excited :D

**Death Note Ep.22**

Still working through it. Yes, surprisingly, I have not watched it yet. Really good.

**Strike the Blood** (17-end)  
My guilty-pleasure. I liked it and I know it's not a good anime. If season2 is released I'm going to watch it. Still a bit frustrated, that they got rid of the first OP. (Rating: 7,5/10 prob closer to 8)

**Kara no Kyoukai** (movie 3-epilogue)  
A really good movie series. I started watching it because it was made by ufotable. The best of the movies were 5 (9,5/10) and 7 (9/10). All in all it was highly entertaining. (Rating for complete series: 8,5/10)

I marathoned 20 episodes of Steins;Gate with my friend after watching the first four 3 weeks ago and I gotta say I loved it. Not my favorite show but it was defiantly a damn good time travel story. I might actually rewatch it my dad sometime since he'd probably like all the science and programming talk and there was still a few scenes I didn't really understand the importance of. But anyways hopefully doing this will make me wanna go play the VN's for Chaos;Head and Robotics;Note (if that ever gets translated) now.

Do movies count? Recently I bought Princess Mononoke as I'm a big fan of Studio Ghibli but haven't seen many of their films yet. It wasn't quite what I expected but I was blown away by how great the art looked. The details were quite sharp for a movie that came out in 1997.

The protagonists were all quite likable characters and the antagonists had that villainy charm, especially Eboshi.

The one thing I'll never get over though is how creepy the Deer God looks. I mean [just looks at this thing!](https://i.imgur.com/iVgudAm.jpg?1) It will never not be creepy.

For some reason I gutted through two more episodes of **Guilty Crown (13/22)** after a very long hiatus. This is definitely the most unintentionally funny anime I've ever seen. [dumb spoilers](/s "When they explained Guy's past and that him and Shuu were best friends I absolutely lost it. I should've expected a bullshit amnesia plot coming from the gang behind Code Geass. Oh, look, they even threw in some awkward incest stuff. Great job, guys. Even better was the next episode, which conveniently skips the two weeks of fallout and societal ruin that the writers were too incompetent to actually cover. When the wheelchair girl got super legs, completely invalidating most of her struggles with self-worth throughout the episode, I cracked up. The moral of Guilty Crown: as long as you have legs and lasers, you are helpful. If you don't have either, fuck you- go sit in a corner.")

Overall, Guilty Crown is one of the most incompetently written shows I've ever had the (dis)pleasure of watching. Almost none of the characters have consistent personalities, whenever the show is written into an impossible corner a time skip is used to reset everything, and NONE of the villains' motives make any sense. I'll keep watching though, because this train wreck is impossible to tear my eyes from.

I also continued **Uchouten Kazoku (9/13)**. I honestly don't have much to say about this show. It's brilliant, and if you are a fan of anime you should watch it. Watching the struggles of Yasaburo's family runs the whole gauntlet of human emotions. I almost never tear up at shows, but I've held back some tears once or twice so far for this one. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll start questioning whether or not some of your friends are actually Tanuki. Watch this show.

Watching [Prince of Tennis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22/Prince_of_Tennis). (up to 140 now) Glad i finally started watching this series as i am a fan of sports anime but i was scared of the huge number of episodes. But once i start watching they just keep on coming!

Series is really good but it irks me a bit that every single match is just a one-set match and so far it's only been team tennis? When will i get to see solo tourneys? Will i ever?

Also there's a lot of fillers in between matches, some recap episodes and stuff which can be annoying and boring as i much prefer to just see the action and watch the players evolve. That being said they do add to the story and progress of the series so there's that!

As a mecha fan I enjoyed it. It's nice to see a mecha series with a female lead that didn't have blatant fanservice. Ok-ish plot and characters, but I loved the visuals and the music. Not a fan of the mecha design, but the backgrounds, especially the sea and the sky, was just gorgeous.

**Katanagatari 12/12**
I finished this show in around 2 days and it has the most beautiful animation style I've watched so far. I still can't get over the amount of talking but all of it felt natural so it never bored me. Also the character development of Shichika is wonderfully done which adds to the beauty of the show. This show even has one of the best endings I've witnessed in anime; it left me feeling satisfied that I had watched the show to the end.

**[Brother, Dear Brother](http://myanimelist.net/anime/795/Onii-sama_e...) 31/39**
I don't even know where to begin with this show. It's old and it's odd. It reminds me of mean girls, but darker and with lots of ambiguously and not so ambiguously bisexual characters. Honestly the biggest problem I've had with the show is its odd combination of melodrama combined with very fast reconciliation. It's one thing when a character freaks out like crazy, but to then when they seem to be perfectly at ease the next day, personally I find it invalidates the original angst. I would rather either more serious long lasting consequences or less over exaggerated reactions.

**[You Are Umasou (Movie)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9204/Omae_Umasou_da_na) Completed**
This movie was something I never expected from a children's movie. A violent story about family, and identity in a world where sometimes one's continued existence is contingent on others deaths. I guess I would call it a more nuanced and less tragic take on The Land Before Time. Honestly I was surprised by the quantity and quality of the fight scenes, but I can't complain. That being said the star of the movie was the characterization of the conflicting personality of the protagonist.

Finished NouCome, dropped it after episode 1 cause CR messed up the audio levels. Picked it up now because I need something to watch before falling asleep. Pretty satisfied, it's super ridiculous.

Watched all of Anohana in one day, and while it didn't unseat Clannad as my favorite tearjerker anime, it was an amazing experience that I want to share with all of my anime watching friends.  Could not recommend more, it's a great human experience.

**Cowboy Bebop (9/26)**

I've finally gotten around to starting this show. There's not much to say so far. It's been pretty good, some episodes hit or miss with me, and I'm excited to see where the show will take me as it's one of those legendary shows. [Spoilers](/s "The Vicious battle and the episode where the man with the Venus plant dies were absolutely amazing compared to the other episodes I've seen. When the sister realizes her brother is dead, I lost it.")

HENNEKO- Most recent started and finished it all today, when I should have been sleeping but it was worth. I'd say 9/10ish. 




My Ordinary Life- Started a while ago and have only reached up to episode 14 but I am enjoying it. 



Photo Kano- Kinda disappointed with how things went after the half way mark making it more of a pick which end you want. Ends up being like 6 episodes instead of the 12 available. Will probably watch the other episodes in between other shows for the sake of finishing the show.





Angel Beats- Finally watched it after having it in queue for months. Was worth the wait and I'm glad how it ended. Will probably watch it again.



Oreshura- Had it in my queue and had trouble deciding so I picked this one. I liked the story and the artwork. Will wait for when more comes eventually. 





Hunter x Hunter- I think I can talk about this because I've only gotten to episode 23 out of 132. I really enjoyed it. Reminds me a bit of Dragonball Z and Yu Yu Hakushou. Will continue watching but probably won't marathon to 132, probably chuncks of episodes. 





I guess thats all I've watched that isn't being shown. Great week in anime watching for me.

Ano Natsu de Matteru 12/12

I just finished this the other night, and my lord this show was awesome. It was one of those shows that I put off watching because I didn't think it looked that appealing but I heard some good things about it. Boy was I wrong when I started watching it... Every episode was always filled with humor, but the humor never got in the way of the story. A lot of times while watching, even several times in one episode, I would find myself saying things like "No way that just happened." and "NO THE EPISODE CAN'T END HERE!". I feel really bad for the people that had to wait every week for the next episode. Often times in a romance anime, particularly one that has any kind of harem qualities to it, the characters are almost never decisive, but I'm glad this anime wasn't one of them. It tied up everything between the characters really well, which I was certainly happy about by the time I finished. Plus, an OVA is coming out this summer that I didn't know about until after I finished, so that was a nice treat for me!

I definitely recommend this anime if anybody has the time for it.

My brother finally made me finish The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and watch the movie. Holy crap that was amazing.

I've been watching Another and Golden time, I finished golden time last week and Im glad that the ending ended up like it should but Im sad that there will probably not be a season two just because other animes are more popular, the light novel and manga didn't stay far ahead of the anime and pretty much closed it up. Another has been some creepy ass stuff from the start but It really hooks you in and honestly I get creeped out if I watch it at night, getting close to finishing it.

I watched Clannad and Clannad After Stories consecutively, I think it's safe to say I'm an emotional wreck at the momment

I just started watching Another last night. I feel like I know what's going on but the show is dancing around the issue. So I probably have no idea what's actually going on. pretty good so far though. Just finished episode 4.

I wrapped up Kokoro Connect and began Shin Sekai Yori. I thoroughly enjoyed the characterization in Kokoro, and Shin Sekai Yori is living up to its genre and actually being a frightening world. I get shivers when I think about living in that kind of a future.

**High School DxD**

I started watching for fanservice and stayed for story.  It was strangely addicting, although I felt as if I didn't really need to see the second season, but a friend HIGHLY recommended me to watch it anyways, so I'll see what's up later.


**Nisekoi**

This was something I meant to watch earlier, but didn't really feel like.  I heard a lot of good things about it and I decided to watch.  For the most part I liked it, there were a couple of small things that bothered me, but the story was too captivating and overshadowed them.


**Nekomonogatari: Kuro**

I'm not really sure what to say about this.  It maintained the charm and style from the earlier series and I like it for that, but at the same time I felt like it was a little boring for me this time around.  That being said, I'm still currently watching the Monogatari 2nd Season anyways.


**Tonari no Seki-kun**

I haven't finished this one yet, but it's pretty entertaining.  It's just the right length for me to watch while I eat a sandwich or something.
>> ARTICLE
**Chrome Shelled Regios 24/24**

The best way to describe it would be extremely average. Everything about it was just ok. **7/10**

**Guilty Crown 22/22**

The art and OST were very good. I had a lot of issues with the plot, though. The whole time it was hard to tell who was good and who was bad. The ending was a huge disappointment. I would have much preferred it [had] (/s "Shu and Inori had both died saving everyone else, or both lived.") I felt really unfulfilled [when] (/s "Shu saved everyone and he lost Inori. The main reason he went to fight Gai was to save Inori. He ended up both losing her, and being crippled.") I was quite unsatisfied. **7/10**
>> ARTICLE
I finished [My Bride is a Mermaid (Seto no Hanayome)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2104/Seto_no_Hanayome). It was fantastic! I'd say this is along the lines of Kill la Kill with respect to over-the-top, the only difference being this show is a comedy with some action.

Give it a try! Watch until episodes 7 & 8 (those two are prime episodes imo).

Nisekoi and Non Non Biyori.

Oh God I haven't done one of these in so long.

So, a while ago I realised I really liked Gainax's style, and decided to try and watch all of their work. Right now I'm watching **Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water.** It's ... interesting. It is very much a kid's show, but it's really good at attention to detail, especially with the machines. It's also based off Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, so take from that what you will.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Soul Eater. I've been ignoring this for many years but I'm glad that I picked it up. It's worth it. Still on episode 24 though.


EDIT: I finished the whole thing last night. The last episodes are absolute garbage. Well, I wouldn't expect good things from anime original endings anyways. Well, I'm gonnna read the manga at some point so I hope they do the series any justice.

I just finished Puella Magi Madoka Magica like 20 minutes ago. I know everyone said it was great and all that, but I really thought people were just blowing it out of proportion. I was wrong on that. Not really the typical thing I watch (hardly watch anime as is), but I really liked it. It got me with the whole episode ten thing. Sort of reminds me of Sam and Frodo.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate and Angel Beats! They became a part of my top anime list. I'm glad I watched them after they finished airing, I wouldn't be able to handle the wait. Also, does anybody know if any of the Steins;Gate spin-offs are worth it? The epigraph trilogy manga looks interesting.

**Cowboy Bebop 20/26** 

I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this anime. On one hand, the characters are great - Spike, Jet and Faye especially. The opening and ending are both great. On the other hand, I really dislike the episodic style of the show; it always feels like the continuity within the series is weak. Its still a solid **9/10** for me though.

Ergo Proxy (complete) and Planetes (13/26). Loved EP and really, really enjoying Planetes. I'm definitely going to try to watch something similar next, although I should probably watch something I've already downloaded instead of loading up my hard drive even more.

Only one currently airing show that I'm watching (Hitsugi no Chaika), so I made up my own schedule for the other days complete with corny titles:

*Marathon Monday* (shows longer than ~26 episodes)  
**Legend of the Galactic Heroes: My Conquest Is the Sea of Stars** (1/1) - A prequel movie for the series. I'll admit I wasn't paying attention through the entire thing and it honestly kinda bored me. Was compared to Banner of the Stars but I honestly preferred the latter for the relationship rather than the giant interstellar war. Will move on to either the next movie or main series, I forget what the right order is off the top of my head.

*Top Tuesday* (highest average rating on my to-watch list)  
**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (0/64) - Okay, haven't started watching it yet, just getting it on the list. Have seen the original FMA but that was years ago so I've forgotten the minutiae and I'm looking forward to it.

*Thursdub* (dubbed shows, can include rewatches of series I've seen subbed)  
**Baccano!** (1/16) - So far I'm more confused than anything. A lot of characters, some of which are connected, some of which are immortal, and a framing device for the story involving a little girl. I like the premise so far, I just need to get deeper into it.

*Feels Friday* (romance/other highly emotional series)  
**ef: A Tale of Memories** (1/12) - Also a little confusing so far, but fewer characters to keep track of. Not a lot to say, other than I'm concerned about the well-being of the girl with the eyepatch at the abandoned train station.
>> ARTICLE
This is me, sneaking [Beck](http://myanimelist.net/anime/57/Beck) into your lineup for Thursdub. There are a bare handful of shows out there that I absolutely recommend the dub over the sub, and I count Beck as being the best of them. Yes, even better than Cowboy Bebop.

started Mayoi Neko only couple episodes in seems funny so far.
started Mahou Shoujo Magica only 2 or 3 episodes in seems alright 

>> ARTICLE
**Toradora** - 25/25 - 7/10

Despite its acclaim as one of the best anime romcoms, I didn't find it to be too great. The lead got pretty boring, Taiga and Kitamura seemed pretty unrealistlic as people, and the ending was over-dramatic, feeling like it came out of nowhere (and best girl Ami got nothing). Some charming moments and nontypical characters though so it wasn't ever boring.

**White Album 2** - 6/13

Really enjoying the direct confrontation of problems and intelligent banter. The lead seems less unique than I had hoped, but I think i can feel the feels coming.

**Shinsekai yori** - 15/25

I heard the first half was slow, but I did not find it uninteresting at all. The world building is very interesting and I love how you get the same feeling the children have about the truth: ominous.
>> ARTICLE
**Canaan** (13/13) I'm a bit torn about this one. On the one hand, it has all the pieces necessary for being a solid show - decent animation, character development, a strong splash of action and forward momentum in every episode and a plot that more or less makes sense (on an anime scale, anyway).  I still don't quite get some of the character motivations (why the heck did that kid decide to get himself shot by Canaan in episode 3 or so, besides the meta-narrative purpose of driving a wedge between the two protagonists?) and some of the acting got *very* hammed up at points, but overall it's an *okay* series. Not great, just okay. It just seems to be missing that...spark. 

**Aiura** and **Mangirl!** (12/12, 13/13). Two short series of very short episodes (3-4 minutes apiece). Both are slice-of-life comedies following groups of girls. I probably preferred Aiura out of the two - standalone comedy suits the ultrashort format a lot better than the serial storyline of Mangirl! did. Still, both provided pretty much exactly what I wanted them to: calorie-light fodder to watch while waiting a few minutes for the bus.

Finished Kill la Kill and Psycho Pass. 

Kill la Kill was very entertaining, though it dragged on a bit through the start/middle. The last 9 episodes were great and felt very much like TTGL in terms of the hype and energy, which I loved. Objectively it might not be as good as something like Fate/Zero, but I enjoyed watching Kill la Kill more for the pure entertainment value. The soundtrack was pretty good, especially the female character themes, though some were unnecessarily used or over used at times (Don't lose your waaaay). I think your enjoyment of this series really depends on how you view Mako + her family, and their comic relief.

Psycho Pass was a great series. Solid characters and character development, including a great villain. He was smart, had a plan, had a point, was a good fighter, and was bat-shit insane. Loved the action (the dominator was bad ass). The show had a cool cyber punk setting, and their society, along with it's implications, was quite an interesting one to think about. I loved the dark feel of the show, and the end of every episode just made me want to watch more. Can't wait for season 2.

**Hyouka 7/22**

Visuals are pretty damn good, animations are superb, Sasuga KyoAni. Not a big fan of how every character drawn by them looks so similiar though. Sometimes I cannot tell the difference between Togashi and Houtarou. I have heard this is one of KyoAni`s last good anime before the Moe take-over. It has not topped Chuunibyou nor Haruhi for me and I am not really that impressed with the storyline. I really like how the MC is the combo of the VAs of Tomoya and that Sunohara. I am hoping that they actually keep Satoshi as a MC as opposed to what happened to Sunohara and that guy from Chuunibyou. I am a pretty big fan of the contrast of shadows KyoAni used. Probably an 7.3/10 for me atm. That episode with the `Hyouka` revelation was pretty well done. If the series continue on to have something like that the score easily rises to 8 and maybe even 9. 

**Spirited Away (Completed)**

Never been a big fan of anime movies. Only ones I really enjoyed were the Evangelion ones, and if you manage to top that, you probably belong someplace special. I have always heard the hype behind Miyazaki films. I saw **From Up on Poppy Hill** the other week and was surprised by how well it was done. Granted I watched it in english dub, in a room full of idiots who talked about other subjects, and in 2 separate sessions so my score of it would probably be a bit deflated. Nevertheless, Spirited Away did not meet my expectations. I loved the MC ; a heroine is always a nice change of pace, and even better when she is capable of actually doing things. The use of Ghibli magic to make almost everyone fall for her, in a non romantic sense, is a bit unnerving but fun to watch. I was not a fan of how quickly the main conflict was solved, and wished it had taken up more than like 1/6 of the movie. The Hollow-like no face entity was pretty hilarious to watch. Whoever VA-d him deserves a medal. I am honestly gonna expect more out of Princess Mononoke, the Moving castle one, and GoTFF. Still enjoyable to watch albeit not my type of show. 6.5/10 
>> ARTICLE
I found Spirited Away to be more of a visual experience than narrative, some people take to it and others don't, but if you like heroines Ghibli is a great place to look. Nausicaa is my personal favorite.

I finally got on watching Code Geass because Lulu won best guy. I must say, there's something to that claim. He is really interesting. 

Though I haven't reached the point (at episode 19 S1) where I can say CG is a masterpiece. Some of the supporting characters have really questionable (as in what the fuck is wrong with them) motivations.
>> ARTICLE
I have been watching this too, at episode 14 atm.

It has been very good up to now, really hope it stays that way
>> ARTICLE
Same here.  I gave it three episode and I hated it. Poorly designed uninteresting characters with weird physique just turned me off to it.
>> ARTICLE
I also hated the character designs in Code Geass. You can say they are stylized or whatever but at some points they looked a lot more like stick figures than anything resembling a human.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass is definitely not a masterpiece. It just had that certain quality to it that made it *amazing* to watch while it was airing. Nothing's gotten the anime community as hyped on a week to week basis as Code Geass. I'm sure it's still highly entertaining if you watch it now, but I don't think anyone watching now would really understand why it achieved the popularity it did.

I thought R1 was pretty good, but I didn't like R2 nearly as much. I hated how they took away all the strategy out from the battle scenes and replaced it with the "the one who has the biggest baddest and newest mech wins" -format.

**[Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=8795) (1-12/12)**

Dat Gainax + Hiroyuki Imaishi + TeddyLoid was glorious. Easily the most "vulgar"/"vile" anime you can get, and it was *great*. You can easily see some of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill in it. The soundtrack is also among my favorite, [I mean listen to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KN0_-HgWNo).

Was the reason there's still no second season after that cliffhanger of an ending, that Hiroyuki Imaishi left Gainax and founded Trigger?

Been watching that college anime archive leak. It is basically a bunch of anime that was created during 1920s through 1950s and it's surreal seeing anime creators of that era experiment with anime shorts. You can tell some of its techniques are still used to this day. One strange short even had key frames used for every part of the animation (the major frames viewers will get to see after an animation flurry) and you can tell it would only be feasible on a short. There are a bunch of shorts that featured a lot of violence and sexual content too. Even some stuff had full frontal nudity. Although I suppose many shorts didn't make it to public as these are largely experimental.

**Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuiokuhen (4/4)**

Ended up finishing this. Apparently I wasn't supposed to watch this first, but it is the prequel to the entire series (just not in broadcast order?).

It was pretty awesome. I'm going to watch the full series later this week. Pretty excited. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the OVA first, don't think it's really that big of a deal. The show is good for what it is - an above average/good battle shounen. I'd recommend the OVA to everyone, not the show though.
>> ARTICLE
Don't expect the TV anime to live up to the OVA or you'll likely be disappointed.  The tone and animation style / quality are very different.  The series has some great moments, but it's mostly a typical battle-shounen.

I finally finished Legend of the Galactic Heroes.  I've been watching it slowly since last July, savoring every bit of it.  'twas a fantastic ride.  LoGH was the easiest 10/10 I've ever given (for reference, I've only given eleven 10/10s, with about 250 anime seen).

For something different, I decided to try Yozakura Quartet.  I watched the first episode of Hana no Uta before realizing I was watching the wrong one first.  -__-

My only real complaint to LoGH is that Sci-Fi Writers Have No Sense Of Scale.

No idea, haven't watched it aside from clips. But from what I know it goes with an anime only ending and deviates away from the manga. 

Hana no Uta is the way to go.
>> ARTICLE
First I watched **[NieA Under 7](http://myanimelist.net/anime/800/NieA_Under_7)**. Sci-fi meets slice of life in this anime from 2000 by the creator of Haibane Renmei and Serial Experiments Lain. My best comparison to any show that I can think of is The Odd Couple, but I think most of you guys are a bit too young to remember that. >_> The show's biggest strength are the great characters it crafts, and the interaction between NieA and Mayu. It has some hilariously racist and offensive humor in it, so if that's not your thing, then you should probably avoid it.

I also just started **[Brother, Dear Brother](http://myanimelist.net/anime/795/Onii-sama_e...)**. It's basically Revolutionary Girl Utena mixed with a big helping of Mean Girls. I'm only 8 episodes in, but the drama's been juicy so far. And if you're a fan of yandere characters, this anime may have the craziest one yet. I don't know how this poor MC is going to live for another 31 episodes.

Any way, I'd recommend both of those shows.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, Dear Brother's a classic I haven't properly seen, though I hear good things. Have you seen much else by the director, Dezaki? He was a big influence on Ikuhara, apparently. I'm trying to work my way through more of his stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Not much. Just his Lupin movies and One Pound Gospel. I do look forward to watching The Rose of Versailles.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man. I loved NieA_7. It wasn't mind-blowing or anything but I really liked the themes it presented.

I really enjoyed the interactions between Mayu and NieA. They were both outcasts and victims of happenstance and had their own ways of coping with their problems in life. Unconsciously, both girls supported each other at various times of desperation.

NieA saved Mayu from her boring and mundane way of living. Mayu provided comfort, safety and a home where NieA could always return to when the world proved too much to handle. It's such a complementary dynamic.

**Kaiji:Ultimate Survivor [10/26]** - This show gets me on a different level, shits good. I've heard nothing but praise from the series. I've only watched 10 episodes but it's already in my top 5. Every episode so far was intense, I had no idea what would happen. I thought I had spoiled myself with the thumbnails of the files, but I was kinda wrong(which I'm happy about).

 I love the way they handled gamblers. Pretty much all of them were deadbeats, but there were some just different. They were smart and slick and I'm curious how that got in such a situation. 

Kaiji as a character is really interesting, in a good way. The soundtrack is on point and I really like the kinda goofy character designs. So far at least for me it's a 10/10. I do hope it doesn't drop in quality. ***Zawa Zawa***

**Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster (0-4/6)**

It had a slow as hell start, but it's gotten much better. Looking forward to watching the last 2 episodes tonight.

**Zan Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei (0-13/13)**

Brilliant as usual. Now I need to find somewhere that has the OVA's in a decent quality. Could anyone tell me what chapter the anime stops at so I can continue on with the manga?












>> ARTICLE
Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei doesn't adapt the chapters in any particular order, mostly because they aren't connected in any way. Also, as far as I know the manga isn't fully translated, so be prepared for large missing chunks of chapters. It sucks, but hey, not much you can do about it.
>> ARTICLE
That's a shame. Thanks for the help. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it sucks, I was Shaft would continue the series, it's one of my favourite comedies. Anyway, gald I could help.

The last two episodes of Gunbuster are amazing

They're on a whole other level compared to episodes 1-4. I don't think anything ever will top those two episodes for me. They're just fucking amazing.

I've just finished the wildest fucking ride this medium ever gave birth to, that is [**SAMURAI MOTHER FUCKING FLAMENCO**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19365/Samurai_Flamenco)

Don't know anything that goes as apeshit as Samurai Flamenco, but [Ben-To](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10396/Ben-To) is just pure entertainment done right in my oppinion.

**Sword Art Online II 18-24**

Finally, finally done with this series, and I just want to say that goddamnit, I wish that the rest of SAO had been this good. Not saying it was great or anything, but the quality of writing in this arc seemed far and away better than the rest of them. Fucking wish that they hadn't made everything about [SAOII](/s "Kayaba Akihiko"), though. Still, it managed to elevate SAOII above mediocrity to me, and was fairly compelling emotionally.
>> ARTICLE
Dude that last arc...+ the ED was fuckin brilliant. Thats some depressing, emotional music right there
>> ARTICLE
SAO2 sure did end on a high note and maybe tricked me into watching a season 3. It's going to continue as "good" as it ended, right? Right? :(
>> ARTICLE
The light novels get really good. If you've ever read the book series Eragon its very similar to how the rest of the sword art online plays out.
>> ARTICLE
Any idea when the next LN comes out? Been 7 months since 15.

Think it might be sometime in August, I remember seeing it somewhere.

Edit: Nevermind that, got it confused with something else.

Eragon had a really, really bad ending...

IMO the emotional arc to end it came kind of out of nowhere, but at least it was better than watching them talk for entire episodes like they did when they first went back to Alfheim.
>> ARTICLE
I spent the past couple days catching up on Log Horizon so I didn't watch too much else.

**Legend of the Galactic Heroes 31-38/110**

The battle during these episodes was pretty cool. I always find it funny that Reinhard or Yang will lay out this complicated plan and then it'll cut to the other person who immediately figures out that plan. Still good overall. I should watch faster.

**Haiyore! Nyaruko-san 5-9/12**

This show entertains me for whatever reason. I don't get every reference but the general wackiness works well enough. Every episode consists of me telling myself over and over that Hasuta is a trap.
>> ARTICLE
I've been meaning to watch Nyaruko-san forever, but I'm not really sure where to start. Everything I see says there's only twelve episodes, but there are like 4 seasons listed on Crunchyroll. What up with that?
>> ARTICLE
There's only 2 seasons for Nyaruko. Nyaruko-san and Nyaruko-san W like the other dude mentioned. I'm pretty sure the "extra" two seasons are the OVAs for each season (both seasons have an OVA). So yeah, watch Nyaruko-san, then its OVA, then Nyaruko-san W and its OVA and HYPE FOR NYARUKO-SAN F.



Hope it helped.

As far as i could tell, there were 2 seasons,  nyaruko-san and nyaruko-san W, which came later.

**Toradora  [15/25]**

I love tsunderes. I hated Taiga for the first few episodes. However, she, and all the other characters, have grown much more likable than you would first imagine when they're first introduced. They all have weaknesses, histories, and emotions that they try to hide, so it's very rewarding when you get a glimpse of who each character is truly. As of now, the drama doesn't seem to have kicked into high gear but I'm excited to see how this story will turn out. 

EDIT: I finished Toradora today when I should have been studying for midterms but long story short: Orenji/Orange (2nd ED) is a FANTASTIC song and the ending of Toradora put a big smile on my face (even if it wasn't perfect)
>> ARTICLE
**Haruhi**: was cool show but my god endless 8 and sigh of haruhi were pretty meh. the original episodes were really good imo as i felt everything went right. now just have to watch the movie. I watched all of endless eight so yeah.

**Gintama**: oh my god the beetle  hunting episode was so god damn funny i almost died laughing. Gintama will always be the best show about something ever.

**Serial Experiments Lain (13/13)**

This is one of those well-respected classics that's been on my to-watch list for a long time, and I'm glad I finally finished it. This is some of the best cinematography and shot composition I've seen in an anime series, and the whole thing is just dripping with atmosphere. Lain herself also grew on me, and I was impressed with the way they handled her struggles in the second half.

To be honest, it wasn't perfect - the creators were onto some good ideas, but they threw so much disparate stuff into the mix that they didn't always connect in a meaningful way (aliens, anyone?). I also had some problems with the pacing and underdeveloped side-characters, especially in the first half. Even so, the show's best moments - [when her sister](/s "gets thrown out of space/time"), [or when Lain](/s "tries to strangle her persona in the Wired") - are legitimately some of the best things I've seen in anime. The ride's a little rough at times, but it's a classic for a reason.
>> ARTICLE
Lain's one of my all-time favourites, I just love how it's so very bizarre and yet it continues to makes sense and amaze me. If you're interested, some of the staff went on to produce other series, most notably [Texhnolyze](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26/Texhnolyze) and [Haibane Renmei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei), both of which I'd also highly recommend (though for very different reasons). Anyway, good for you to have watched and enjoyed such a thoughtful series.
>> ARTICLE
**Nana**

This one was difficult for me. Not because of the writing, because that was excellent. Not because of the characters, because those were amazing. Not because of the music, because that was *awesome as fuck*. Instead, it was because I've seen events like this happen many many times.

Dating friends break up. Old friends drift away. New friends drift in. Friends date people you can't stand to be around. And it was this friendship dynamic between the main characters that made Nana truly shine. Because it felt real: messy, complicated, and never easy. 

This isn't some generic "win through the power of friendship" shounen. This is josei at its best. 

Score: 9/10  
Recommendation Level: Everyone who is looking for an anime that doesn't feel fake.

**Suzumiya Haruhi-chan no Yuuutsu**

So yeah. I kinda needed something a bit lighter after that. And Haruhi-chan served wonderfully. While it wasn't quite the Haruhi we all know and most of us love, it was still Haruhi enough to satisfy. 

Score: 6/10  
Recommendation level: http://i.imgur.com/trmSmrp.gif

**Hetalia Axis Powers**

Okay. Maybe I went a bit too far on the "look for something lighter" axis. Because this was... kind of annoying, to be honest. Not just because the jokes fell flat most of the time. Not just because Italy was purposefully voiced to be an annoying punk. Not just because of the same-face syndrome that made some of the characters indistinguishable from each other. 

Instead, the worst thing about Hetalia was that it recycled its animation. Maybe because of the budget being blown on voice actors? I don't know. But time after time after time, you saw the same animation used over and over and over again. For a full-length full-cour series, it's a major fault. For a 52-episode series that only lasts four or five minutes per episode? That gets real annoying real fast.

Hetlia did have some pluses. While some of the characters were indistinguishable from each other, the rest of them were extremely interesting and remarkably well-defined. (Hungary is best girl.) Little tidbits of actual historical facts sprinkled around the show definitely kept it from being a complete waste of time. And while the humor was hit-and-miss throughout the 250-minute run, it got pretty darned funny during the rare moments when the humor hit big.

Score: 5/10  
Recommendation Level: It'd probably be a lot more fun while stoned.

On-deck: Onegai Teacher and Yuuki Yuuna.

**Hyouka** - 22 episodes: Just finished this earlier and it was way better than I expected it to be. The mystery solving was my favorite aspect of the show although I gotta say I wish it had stopped on episode 17 after the school festival arc since anything that happened afterwards wasn't as good.
>> ARTICLE
What website are you watching it on? I can only find it on Dailymotion and I have a hate/hate relationship with that site.
>> ARTICLE
I downloaded it and I wouldn't be allowed to link it anyway if the website was illegal. A little bit of Googling should have some results.
>> ARTICLE
It's one of these shows that you have to watch in 1080p.
>> ARTICLE
That's a shame. I really loved that last scene. It was done in a really unique way but I felt it really fit the show well. [Spoilers] (/s "Hotarou found color in his high school life through Chitanda, and even though the confession was fake, the intent was there which I'm happy about.") The show was never about the mysteries for me, though they were somewhat entertaining, but rather the characters.
>> ARTICLE
I personally didn't give a lot about the mysteries(I still found them interesting). It was all about the small character moments and interactions with a beautifully artistic execution. Probably one of my favourite set of characters that I have watched so far.
>> ARTICLE
Yes!  I kept telling my friend I loved how the characters did these little quirky movements or mannerisms that really reminded me of my childhood.

The one scene where Oreki is basically perched on the chair while talking on the phone, I used to do weird little things like that.  

I just Love that the show was so cute with out a bunch of little squeaky voiced underage "kaiwaii" girls, I just find that stuff annoyingly however this show got everything right. The mystery stuff was a nice way to move the show along but what really won me over we're those little mannerisms.

[Sword Art Online II (21-24/24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21881/Sword_Art_Online_II) - Finished Sword Art Online II early this week. I made a big post about it in this past week's Recommendation Tuesday thread, and I explained a lot of what I thought was really good about it. Basically, I felt like both stories had a lot more impact than ALO and were on the level of the original Aincrad arc, in part because of the life-or-death connection with the real world.

[K-On! (Rewatch)(6-11/13)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On!) - Continuing my re-watch of K-On this week and I've been loving it just as much as the first time. I've been thinking in particular that I'm liking Azusa a lot more than the first watch, she's in serious contention for becoming new best girl and de-throning Mio.

[Death Note (1-18/37)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note) - On urging from a friend, I decided to check out Death Note this week on Netflix...and I'm damn glad I did. It's been an amazing ride so far. Light and L are both brilliant, well-written protagonists and seeing the way they butt heads and their intelligence clashes with one another makes for a really entertaining experience. Really looking forward to the rest of this one.

*The week ahead:* Planning to finish Death Note by around Friday or Saturday and then starting Black Rock Shooter (after getting a recommendation from someone a while ago). Also going to finish my daily K-On re-watch and then likely start re-watching Nozaki-kun daily.

EDIT: [Kill La Kill (5-24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18679/Kill_la_Kill) - Still watching through the dub of Kill La Kill on Toonami, had to miss yesterday's but got caught up on the episode I missed from the week before. Glad we finally see a little bit more of best girl Nonon.

**Digimon Adventures 01** - completed
I just picked it up on a whim to get ready for the new series coming up. It's a kids show and it gets repetitive sometimes but grinding through was worth it. I couldn't believe some of the ideas tossed around were meant for kids. The ending was simply beautiful. I cried. I'm ready for Tri now.

**Steins;Gate**

*Very* slow start to a thrilling mid to end sections. 

Compelling story with an interesting plot.

I just finished this a few hours ago on my way back from the beach. I think it could have been better and the only reason I kept watching was the hype everyone put into it. I understand that the first half was necessary, but I didn't like it as much. 
>> ARTICLE
**NGNL** This show is just wat. But it is a hella fun ride, and I can see where it got its MAL score from. Animation is just amazingly good, and the characters are hilarious. 

**Steins; Gate** Just wow. Why didn't I get around to watching this show earlier. Time travel done right along with having such a strong cast of characters. Episode 22 was a whopper, and it ended on such a high note (That last scene is just A+++ level of feels and execution and the song was spot on). Probably top 2-3 easily if not my favorite. 

The ending as a whole though is still kind of confused in my mind despite me reading up on it, but that's probably more of me not being used to these kinds of plots. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn, which i could've your week.
>> ARTICLE
S;G kind of has 3 endings (that are all pretty damn good)

First is EP 24, technically the end of the anime series.

Next is EP 25 (OVA), probably the most beloved ending I think.

And finally is the movie ending (chronologically the "real" ending), which is personally my favorite.

If you haven't seen the OVA and movie, I HIGHLY advise you to do so.

I have, it's just the ending of the main series that's kind of confusing me, as well as the ending of the movie >_>

**The Studio Change**	

A-1 Pictures holds the quality of AIC Builds season one production, though thats not necessarily surprising given A-1s resume. The director, series composer, screenplay writers, storyboardists, and even some episode directors were retained for the project, so you can expect the personality of OreImo to reflect that. *Because* this is A-1, however, I was expecting either a jump in detail or ambitious sequences and, while I still couldnt point out a scene that stood out to that degree, the baseline of the art and attention given to the production is noticeably good. Its more than what I would expect of a RomCom with its outfit changes, detail in setting, and its tendency to leave nothing at rest for long. I guess that speaks to the popularity of the property and A-1s willingness to invest in something with a history of success.

**Episode 3**

I have no idea where this episode came from. I didnt expect OreImo to have an episode that tied together all of its meritable ideas through an underutilized character as a touching and compelling vignette. Those around us are moving, shifting, growing. Sometimes in directions that take them away from us. Theres a feeling of impermanence [](/s "that Saori puts into words as she acclimates herself to her sisters circle. She eventually gets comfortable through her friendship with Kanata. She finds happiness in the circle. But people grow apart, and the circle leaves her little by little. At first she finds fault in her sister for making her confront those changes through her marriage announcement. Shes angry over her loss. She lashes out. But Kanata tends to that wound and encourages her to rebuild. And she has! Because of this experience, she has the composure and understanding of people that the other members of the main cast lack, which is why shes the crux binding them together.")

Additionally, the episode adds a layer of sentiment to creation. [](/s "Kanatas works are tied to a human element; Meruru is a modeled after her sister and Shikkoku from Shinya. I wouldnt be surprised if their personalities borrowed from traits that Kanata saw and admired in them"). I really appreciated this as anime, eroge, and doujinshi werent given this face prior to this point. In a way it trivializes and pokes fun at the defensiveness of Kuroneko and Kirino in regard to content that they so closely tie their identity to.

Loved the context this episode gave. Its the closest the show comes to providing a counterpoint to the framing of its ideas elsewhere. It felt human. It felt genuine. I admire it for that.

**The, uh, Rest of the Show**

I was a bit underwhelmed with how season one carried itself. It warmly embraced its characters as they were. It championed self-acceptance where the media we appreciate was an important part of that. It hinted at stigmas and societal criticism without really exploring that space. It purposefully opened up one side of a conversation without challenging itself. Its narrative lacked a sense of smoothness. With that impression in mind, season two was a great improvement.

Yes, the undertones still have a [trashy slant](http://38.media.tumblr.com/723b7e42f0f892cdb93601ed09c259b8/tumblr_mlxu58wcfC1rqzfqho1_500.gif). The humor roots itself in [misunderstandings](http://i.minus.com/iby8DrjywfHbh7.gif), [flustered reactions](https://31.media.tumblr.com/46fc11cca34608cba822be6a234df05d/tumblr_n08nbdy9Ku1spf7z6o1_500.gif) to the romantic or sexual, and the [spastic excitement](http://i.imgur.com/EEdPSWw.gif) that comes hand-in-hand with nerdy passion. But god damn if the show didnt inject some honest-to-god sincerity over time with how characters interacted. [](/s "What drove my love for Kuroneko x Kyousuke as a couple was the building of their comfort with one another and how the naturalism of their conversations matched that progression.") It was nice to see that same growth throughout the cast. While there are plot points that serve as a catalyst for melodrama, [](/s "the boyfriend speculation being guilty in particular"), OreImo doesnt idle this season. People are confronted for their feelings. They form better ideas for how they see their futures. They get hurt. They settle into new places. They mature. 
	
**The Specials**

http://i.imgur.com/cwoMwMS.gif

Upsetting. Not just in the events themselves, but in the implications it left on some of its characters. [](/s "Watching Kyou grovel against an ideology that he accepts as correct without being able to properly defend his decision just pissed me off. He sacrificed the entirety of what he built up in the series not relating to Kirino, choosing to bear the brunt of his forbidden love and then going along with a plan that requires him to step down after a given period of time. I would expect him to confront Manami with something other than incest for the win. I cant get over how insultingly vacuous that entire exchange was. Kuronekos rejection scene was given so much care and it was effective as a result. The fact that Kirino and Kyousuke fall on their faces in an attempt to match Kuroneko and Kyousukes awkward what do we do now? dynamic after the confession ruins anything it had going for it. We didnt even follow up with Ayase after her confession or get any hint of what long-term effects the incestuous relationship had on the household!") Regardless of the authors intention, the publishers stance, or the LN ending, *the animes ending* was remarkably dissatisfying and hurtful.

[OP(s)](https://vimeo.com/72911054): Another ClariS track! While the beat didnt stand out like it did in "irony", the vocal hook was solid and matched both the reused and the "relevant to the episode" visuals.
	
ED(s): Given the same care as the first season, where the character at the center of the episode provides vocals on a track to "end card"-esque stills of their character. Favorite: "The Last Ceremony".

It was a mixed bag, but damn if I didnt get caught up in the story. I cheered for [](/s "Kuronekos confession"). I fawned over [](/s "the summer that she and Kyou spent together"). I laughed at [](/s "Ayases knife antics and textbook aversion to admitting her feelings to Kyou until it was too late"). I was heartbroken when [](/s "Kuroneko shredded her Destiny Book and made no effort to hide her tears after being rejected"). A weird ride for sure, but not without its rewards and hilarious community reaction.

There are several reasons why people hated the ending or season 2 in general.

* Some people don't like it [because](/s "they think that incest is gross. I don't mind incest, if two people love each other, who am I to decide that their love is gross, just because I wouldn't do the same with my sister? Also, the show is called 'MY LITTLE SISTER Can't Be This Cute', what did you expect?!")

* Some people don't like it [because](/s "their favorite girl didn't win. Again, the show is called 'MY LITTLE SISTER Can't Be This Cute', it should be pretty clear who'd win the Kyousuke Bowl at the end.")

* Some people don't like it [because](/s "the author pussied out at the end. Instead of going full incest he let them break up again, and it's only implied in the subtext of the very last scene that they might still be together. Either go full incest or don't go there at all, no half measures!")

* Some people don't like it [because](/s "season 2 is a horrible adaptation of the books. They crammed 7 books into 16 episodes (for reference: Spice and Wolf had 4 1/3 books in 25 episodes, and Haruhi had 4.73 books in 28 episodes plus a 2 1/2 hour long movie), so a lot of stuff got removed while at the same time new stuff got made up (that entire story about that PSP dating game is anime-original). For example, they removed big parts of Kyousuke's backstory including an entire harem member, and large parts of Kanako's story were removed as well (why she suddenly likes Kyousuke, why she was suddenly friends with that blonde girl).")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think you accurately summarized everything I saw in the discussion threads. I find the last point strange [considering](/s "how successful the show sold across its run and how A-1 doesn't seem to mind pacing a high-selling adaptation more liberally.")
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoy your writing on episode 3. I never really gave it much thought, thank you! I do like the media aspect and how we relate to it, I felt like it is good that they did not go deep into it since it is in its core a heartly-warm-comedy with parts of this and that.

I still wish they could remake OreImo and do it a lot better and give it the proper treatment, especially towards the ending. It sure did not deliver as well as previously but I felt it to be just mediocre. I am very happy though how the LN ends and at least the author got a little bit of control at the end. I fully support [OreImo OVA2 Ending](/s "KirinoxKyousuke") but as you said, his defense towards the criticism was lackluster.

*Thank you* for watching and writing about my favorite anime. I am very glad that you listened to me. :3 Now, how about some reading? Do you think you will be going through the LN? There is an extra character and Kyou and Kirino's personality is slightly different.

Good. Don't binge it. As I got to the end, it started feeling like a chore because I didn't want to leave it unfinished.

Shoutouts to Sakurasou, had no clue it was this loved/hated

Watched 8 eps of Sakura Trick, decent I guess xD

**Medaka Box Abnormal (Completed)**  
Take a note everyone, this is how you do a read-the-manga ending. To have one of the characters apologise for not ending the show in a conclusive manner is actually hilarious. I do kind of wish there was more though, because things are getting pretty ridiculous. I mean, we see a guy win a fight [by] (/s "rewriting the laws of the universe so that the colour blue no longer exists.") Also the last episode was weird as fuck compared to the rest of the show. I guess you just can't escape the Gainax ending.

**Welcome to the NHK (18/24)**  
That beach episode though. In all seriousness, this show seems to have stagnated a bit. Character development has all but completely disappeared, and we've basically just had Satou exploring different facets of the hikikomori lifestyle. It's still mildly enjoyable to watch, but it doesn't feel like anything special at this point.

**OreGairu**  
Preperation for spring season and really liked it. Some of the supporting cast might be lackluster and it is very episodic but the main cast is a really endearing bunch that's fun to watch bounce off each other. Generally excited where it will take me next season. 8/10

**Star Driver** (ep14)  
Interesting watch so far. The episodic nature can be off putting but the whole thing is about adolescence and clash of ideology in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Appears that I dropped Star Driver after 11 episodes, so I guess I did not enjoy the episodic nature of it all.
>> ARTICLE
Haha yea, I can totally see someone not enjoying it. I have no problems with it though. I mean it's REALLY repetetive but the story and characters do enough for me to keep me engaged.

**Knights of Sidonia (12/12)**

Finally got around to watching this as Season 2 is coming up soon. I had heard this show was Attack on Titan in space but I didn't realize it was actually going to be so similar. I really enjoyed the premise but it certainly wasn't anything mind blowing. Didn't really like the CG at all. Sure, I got used to it but the presentation visually was probably the worst part of the show for me. If there's one thing I enjoyed the most from this show was the world building. While there wasn't too much super in depth exposition I loved learning new things about Sidonia and the Gauna. There is still so much I want to know about and that is ultimately what kept me watching. Here's hoping season 2 will answer some of my questions. Overall I think I enjoyed this show enough that I am interested in watching the second season and also possibly giving the manga a shot. 

I gave it a **7/10** on MAL.

**Katanagatari (8/12)** 

Wow, this show really has exceeded my expectations so far. I knew it was an adaptation of a Nisio Isin novel and I really enjoyed the Monogatari series so I figure I should check this out. While it is completely different to Monogatari in setting I can still tell its his work. The dialogue in this show is just awesome. Every character is interesting and every character interaction is as well. The romance between Shichika and Togame is sparse but sweet. The animation is good, but the character designs and backgrounds are beautiful. The OST is also top notch. I have a few more episodes to go I can't wait to see the conclusion of this awesome series. 

If I had to give this show a rating as of right now it would probably be a high **8/10** or a low **9/10**.

**Gintama (???-109/201)**

I don't know how many episodes I've watched in the last week but its a lot. I love pretty much everything about this show. All the characters are great in their own right. The jokes and voice acting are hilarious. The emotional scenes are actually very moving. If there's one negative thing I could say about Gintama it's that it did take about 25 episodes for me to get into it. So for anyone who wants to pick it up keep in mind it takes a while to get into, but once you get past that point pretty much every episode is thoroughly enjoyable. I'm trying to catch up in time for the new season this spring but I'm not sure if that will happen. Either way I've been enjoying Gintama immensely the past month or so since i started it.

Unless it suddenly gets horrible (which I highly doubt) this show gets a **10/10** from me so far.
>> ARTICLE
**Kuroko no Basuke**: Blazed through the first 2 seasons. It's amazing. I once asked someone if they would recommend it and he said: "No. It's not realistic like Slam Dunk." He was right, it's not realistic. It's fucking amazing.

If someone asked me that question today I'd say: "Do you like stories of struggle, victory and perseverance? Do you like basketball? DO YOU LIKE SUPERPOWERED BASKETBALL?! THEN WATCH THIS NOW".
>> ARTICLE
Finished both Noragami and High School DxD (S3 HYPE), and I've started Haruhi. DxD was surprisingly good, and the second BorN PV made me love it even more. I'm only six episodes into Haruhi (chronological order), but god damn is it good.
>> ARTICLE
Due to a busy schedule (and some other stuff we'll discuss later), I didn't watch as much anime this week as usual, and I only started one new thing, but I'm always game to talk about shit I've been watching.

Praise be to God, my last **Koi Kaze** DVD came in this week, and damn it all was this show great! I'm so glad I watched it. This show made me root for incestuous pedophilia like I never thought I could. It's not for everyone, but for what it's worth, I think it's damn near perfect. I gave it a 9/10 on MAL. Seriousy, I can't recommend it enough.

I've been making slow progress through **Haibane Renmei**. The only reason I'm not done with this show yet is because, in addition to it being a mood show that I have to be in just the right frame of mind to enjoy, I feel like marathonning it would do it a disservice. It's a slow-paced story that deserves to be watched at a slow pace. It's very interesting and visually captivating with a well-built world but not particularly gripping (again, like Sora no Woto). I want to see how it ends, and I'm going to finish it, but it's not something I'd recommend to a lot of people. If you don't like slow, you won't like this.

Equally slow has been my progress through **Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo**. This show soured on me way quicker than I thought it would. It's not that it isn't enjoyable, it's just *so fucking loud*. Things are always happening, and I can't follow the damn subs because there's always often two or three lines on the screen at once, and by the time I've used context clues to figure out who's saying what, it's already moved on to the next set of lines, especially when Misaki is onscreen. I still really like Shiina, but I don't feel like I get to appreciate her enough because there's always somebody else on screen stealing her spotlight. The highlights of the show for me are when she interacts with Sorata, but they're never allowed to be alone. I will say the visual style has grown on me though. I really like how it looks.

Lastly, I started **Nana**. I'm not very far into it, but it's not really grabbing me so far. It doesn't help that I had to spend like two and a half full episodes following the boring community college love exploits of the vastly less interesting of the two Nanas. I'm going to at least finish the first 11 episodes, but if it doesn't have me hooked by then, I'm going to drop it. I don't care if it gets interesting later, I should not have to sit through full arcs of boring to get to the good part (this is what keeps me away from most long-running shounen).

Now, for the thing that's been keeping me from anime lately, **Fate/Stay Night**. This VN is really, really good. I finished the Fate route this week, and holy shit am I glad that [MAJOR FATE ROUTE SPOILERS](/s "they didn't to some stupid asspull at the end that allowed Saber to stay with Shirou.") It had a wonderful ending that legitimately had me tearing up in places. The fights were super badass, and each one legitimately felt unwinnable. There's a genuine feeling that Shriou and Saber are overcoming completely overwhelming odds, which made each fight tense and each victory (and defeat) memorable. I can't say the exposition was handled particularly well, as there were a lot of infodumps, but the stuff being exposited was really cool and it all built a cool, fleshed out world, which was nice. Also, once I learned to appreciate the h-scenes as comedy interludes instead of legitimate character moments, they became much more bearable. Seriously, that h-scene writing is legendarily bad. After finishing Fate, I immediately started the UBW route (that's Unlimited Blade Works, for those of you who've had you head in a bin for the last six months), and it started very strong. I think I can finally join the club of being "gar for Archer," because that man is a certified baddest of asses, as was promised by [Fate Route Spoilers](/s "his awesome, 'You go. I got this.' death scene in Fate"). I can't wait for more of this VN, and I want to finish UBW before the second cour of the anime adaptation starts up, so I need to kick it into high-gear since I'm a slow reader.
>> ARTICLE
> Nana

Hachiko's love life gets a *lot* more interesting in the next few episodes. Fair warning.
>> ARTICLE
Enjoy the rest of the Fate VN! UBW and HF are generally considered to be much better than Fate, at least in terms of developing the cast (while Fate only really developed Saber), and having more interesting themes and storylines. They also lack the huge expositions, except for a couple of scenes, which is why Fate is often called the "tutorial" route.
>> ARTICLE
Well... I just finished Fate/Stay Night: UBW, and hell, it was awesome,  despite having seen Fate/Zero before this one I thoroughly enjoyed this anime! I also watched Oregairu, which reminded me why I loved Monogatari and romcoms. But that's not all,  I've also completed Kuroshitsuji II which sort of sucked compared to season 1 as it was a little bit too much yaoi and the plot was sort of predictable. And last but not least I finished School Rumble,  it was a great ride all along but it couldn't spark my interest that we'll although it was hella funny. 

I spend too much of my time watching anime...

#Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ!

 I've only watched the first episode so far. I really enjoyed Zeta and the 0079 movies, but was wary on starting ZZ due to what people say about it. But I'm going to watch it anyway. I can't wait to watch Char's Counterattack though.
>> ARTICLE
ZZ is a bit tedious. Overall I would say it's not nearly as bad as what some people say about it but it's not really even close to the level of genius of Zeta. Zeta and the movies got a 10/10 from me while I think ZZ got a 7/10 but really only because I'm a massive gundam fan.
>> ARTICLE
I only got into the franchise about a month and half ago, but it's definitely seriously piqued my interest. I'm really interested in what I'll think of ZZ, especially since many people say it doesn't chalk up to Zeta, and here I found a lot of Zeta annoying. Mainly Reccoa, Katz, Four, and Rosamia. That second to last episode was really great for me! 

The rest of the characters are really awesome though. Mostly notably Bright and Char, and about halfway through when Kamille grows up. 
>> ARTICLE
The character's being annoying won't really change. Some ZZ character's are trash. Shinta and Qum are actually much better though. Tomino's ability to write character's in general is pretty awful. They all seem very irrational since he doesn't show their motivations for shit. Judau is a good protagonist however. Really damn good all the way through. Some of his friends are freaking bad though and the antagonists generally aren't as good even if there is a lot more of Haman.
>> ARTICLE
**Bakemonogatari (1-6/15)**

It's been a strange yet interesting watch so far. I like all the characters so far. I'm ready for all the surprises that come my way.
>> ARTICLE
* Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya: 2-10/10 | Not as edgy as I thought it would be. Gets lumped solidly in the magical girl genre. I was amused by the fun-poking that the writers did at the genre as a whole, as well as at its parent Fate series. 6/10
* Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya 2wei: 1-10/10 | Marginally better than the first season. Probably the more interesting plot line. 7/10

**Tamako Market (12/12)**  
  
I love watching KyoAni shows, and picked this one up because of some gifs. It was really enjoyable, the biggest complaint most people usually have is of the bird, Dera, who could be annoying at times. It didn't really bother me much, the KyoAni moeblob was all I needed. I still need to watch the movie which everyone has said is much better, so I look forward to that.  
  
**Rating: 9/10, probably more of an 8.5**

Rewatching Steins;Gate after about a year. Still feels really fresh.

I finished Mirai Nikki re-watch. I still enjoyed it but didn't think it was that good when I first saw it. 

Started to watch Oregairu again and I still love the characters in that show. I almost can relate to Hachiman.

>> ARTICLE
It's a good idea not to spoil yourself with this series. It's a real trip, and I thought it was amazing the first time I finished it but when you watch it 4 times in 2 months (which I did a year later) the plot holes really start to get to you
>> ARTICLE
I'm still continuing my watch of **Cardcaptor Sakura** (17-26/70). It's still a kid's show, and it's still amusing. That's all I have to say, really.

I also watched **Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust** (the movie from 2000, not the 80's one), and it was somehow not that much better than the one from the 80's. Kind of disappointing, actually. The background art, though, was really beautiful.

It's probably going to take me the next month and a half to finish CCS, so I doubt I'll be watching anything else of interest for a while. Sorry.

Bakemonogatari for the first time. And damn it's good. Episode 12 was mind-blowing.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if this counts since they are movies but:  

**Kara No Kyoukai Movie 3** - Well that is one way to start the movie. I was kinda surprised by it, but the movie was really good. I really liked the fight between [KnK3 spoiler](/s "Shiki and Fujimoto. Ufotable outdid themselves on that one. Fujimoto's powers were done amazingly well"). Shiki is cemented as one of the most badass anime characters I've seen.  

**Kara no Kyoukai Movie 4**- I know people say that movie 5 is the one that connects everything together, but I think 4 does as well. It is an origin story, but it is connecting a few of the dots about this series's mythology. I really liked this movie the most in the series so far. For a second, I thought that [KnK 4 spoilers](/s "Kotomine Kirei showed up and was granting powers to everyone. This is in the Nasu-verse, so I could see that happening. But it wasn't Kirei :( ").

Oh yeah. Movies count.

I finished Gintama this past week. Gintama is great and has blasted its way into my top 3. I can't get over how good the Four Devas and the Courtesan of the Nation arcs were. I can't wait for the series to resume next month. 

I also started Jojo's Bizarre Adventure yesterday, I'm only on the 7th episode and so far so good. I really love the names of the characters and all the cultural references they have. The fights are well done, and the animation is not lacking in any aspect. It's a really fun series, and I expect a lot just from these first few episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
**[Haikyuu!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu!!) (1-25)**

I enjoy my sports anime but I never cared much for the sport of volleyball... until now. I really like how this has a nice blend of the realism I could appreciate in the tennis anime Baby Steps, whilst having the more exciting aspects of the basketball anime Kuroko no Basuke. Not only that but it surpasses both of those, to become my 2nd favourite sports anime franchise so far (just behind Hajime no Ippo). Cannot wait for a 2nd season. 

**[Yondemasu yo, Azazel-san. Z](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16241/Yondemasu_yo_Azazel-san._Z) (8-13)**

Was just finishing off the 2nd season of this random ass comedy series, I started a couple weeks ago. Just the kind of anime I can watch on my phone, during my lunch breaks and get 15 mins of enjoyment out of it (per day). Was funny, grotesque, but nothing special.
>> ARTICLE
Working my way through Aria the Animation after the reddit went hype over the new special announcement a few weeks back. It looked interesting enough so I put it on my list.

On recommendations from others I've been taking it slow, with 1 or 2 episodes a night. In the beginning the show didn't really do much for me. But I just finished the OVA between S2 and S3 and the show really begins to shine. It managed to tear me up several times by now.

I'm happy to hear it gets better. I started the 2nd season recently and it's been really enjoyable. Such a comfy show.

**Welcome to the NHK**

I really fell in love with this show from the second or third episode, but now that I just finished 22, it went from the masterpiece I perceived it to be to a very memorable but heavily flawed experience.

For one thing, the animation disparity can be absolutely appealing, there are episodes where characters look like amorphous blobs. 

But the thing that bothers me most is how the show seems to lose it's way after the halfway point. I can tell they are trying to stuff a lot of narrative into the final few eps but they wasted a lot of time from 12-20 or so. It just feels like it is floundering.

Despite it all I really enjoy watching this series and I think I've learned a lot from it.

Also I've watched a few more episodes of **GTO - The Animation**. This is easily my favorite show of all time now. I'm learning to draw just so I can come close to the expressions they use in this show. After watching GTO a lot of new anime feels super samey, especially stylistically. But this post isn't to harp on other shows, it's to praise this fantastic one!
>> ARTICLE
Watching Welcome to the NHK right now and I definitely agree it dropped a lot in quality after episode 12. Though I just finished 20 do hopefully it picks back up for me.

My main problem is that people hyped it up as perfectly defining how it is to be an introvert and for someone who is introverted themself it doesn't seem to actually have much in common with how I feel.

**Fate/Zero 2nd Season 1/12**

Finally got around to watching the Fate series and I must say Fate/Zero is already infinitely better than Fate/Stay Night. Also, I finally understand why Saber is best girl. (Senjougahara will always be number 1 best girl though :P)
>> ARTICLE
You won't get why Saber is best girl until you read the Fate route, though. In Zero, she's just there to get her ideals trampled by everyone and their mother, but doesn't get any real development. ~~Rin and Illya are still better girls anyway~~

are you talking about Fate/Stay Night? If so i already know about that and Saber is even better there :P

**[Akira](http://myanimelist.net/anime/47/Akira)** (rewatch)  
8/10. I understand it a bit more than when I first watched it like 3 years ago, but I still don't get a lot of it. Really enjoyable though, I plan to read the manga at some point.

**[Isshukan Friends.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21327/Isshuukan_Friends.) (1-12/12)**  
7.5/10. Fujimiya is so cute, I actually added this to my PTW because of some gifs in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2vf2iz/give_me_the_best_wink_youve_seen_in_anime/). I enjoyed this show, I didn't expect it to have so much drama. I usually hate when characters are added really late in series but it made sense here, I'm okay with it. Definitely a worthwhile watch if you want some cheesy friendship/romance. The way the two main characters talked to each other reminded me of how I used to talk with a girl back in high school, >tfw

**[Psycho-Pass 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23281/Psycho-Pass_2) (2-11/11)**  
7/10. This was solid, some more cool plot junk and poltical philosophy as I expected. I liked the first season more but this one is definitely worth watching if you liked the first season at all, it's quite similar in quality. I'll watch the movie eventually, it looks like it's a stand-alone movie (right?) so I'm not in a huge rush to get to it.

**[Ga-Rei Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4725/Ga-Rei:_Zero) (2-12/12)**  
6.5/10. I watched the first episode like a year ago and put it on hold because I was just getting back into anime and there were a lot of other shows I wanted to watch. I finally picked it back up and it was pretty good, not my usual thing but I was entertained, [Kagura and Youmi are real qt](http://imagr.eu/up/514ba7128ebd9_ga-reizero7.jpg). Not very memorable but a worthwhile watch, and if you like action more than me I'm sure you'll get a lot more out of it than I did!

**[Patema Inverted](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12477/Sakasama_no_Patema)**  
7/10. A really cool idea for a movie, and the rest of it was your usual solid anime movie stuffa young romance, a moral about how humans should understand each other, etc. Nothing to knock your socks off but I'm glad I watched it, plus [Patema is p-cute](http://bttm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/patema2_hires.jpg) (that pic is from what is now one of my favorite stargazing scenes in anime).

**[Kill la Kill](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18679/Kill_la_Kill) (1-7/24)**  
Finally getting around to this. I loved TTGL and this is quite reminiscent, so I have high hopes.

I watched Millennium Actress for the first time and man, was it beautiful. Satoshi Kon died too soon.

**Monster** (74/74) - Amazing show as a whole. I felt it kind of dragged at times but the moments the show builds up to made it all worth it. [Spoilers] (/s "So many great moments. Grimmer saving the kid from jumping, and his death later on were brutal. Also, Tenma stopping Nina from killing herself.")

[Spoilers] (/s "I'm not sure how I felt about that last episode. What was the point of Tenma's dream of Johan talking to him and bringing up how the mother betrayed him? It just seems like a weird place to end the series, with him escaping right after. I'm not even opposed to open endings in general but that just seemed very poorly done. Besides that last episode, it was a pretty damn powerful ending. I really liked Tenma's decision. Given the chance to save or let Johan die again knowing him for what he was, Tenma chose to stand by his principles as a doctor and do what he had to do.")

I was offput by its length for the longest time, but I'm glad I finally got around to watching it.

Amagami SS, episodes 1-5

I'm not entirely sure what to think about this one, I've heard that's it's pretty decent and I can see that I *might* enjoy it.  One question I have, does the MC stay a stuttery  boring one dimensional character throughout the series?  Because that's all that's really testing my patience at this point.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the MC isn't the strongest part of the show but I feel he does act differently a bit in each arc. The shows real strength is the uniqueness of each heroine rather then the male MC.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it is a dating sim type anime after all.  Kind of disappointing, I really like character interaction but that doesn't really happen much with self insert characters. :/
>> ARTICLE
As a girl I related more with the different female characters and I fell in love with how they different they were. The male MC is a bit hard to get over but it's a short romance in an omnibus format so don't let that rattle you too much!

7/10 Found it kind of "meh" but quite liked the ending.

**[Pokemon: The Origin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20159/Pokemon:_The_Origin) (4/4)**
7/10 Good for a bit of nostalgia but that's about it, just follows the story of the original red/blue Pokemon games.

**[The Garden of Words](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16782/Kotonoha_no_Niwa) (Movie)**
10/10 Loved it, recommend to anyone who likes a love story or just incredibly beautiful animation.

**[Time of Eve](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7465/Eve_no_Jikan_(Movie) (Movie)**
9/10 A great, thought provoking movie about servant androids in the future, can they feel? At what point do they stop being things and become a "person"?

**[Sword of the Stranger](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=2418) (Movie)**
9/10 Great action/samurai move, the animation if very fluid and the sword fights are excellent.

9/10 Really enjoyed this one, found the characters great and a cool vision of the near future.

**Fairy Tail (165-175/175)**

Finally got through this. I was having a really good time watching all the different fights in these episodes. Especially the [](/s "Natsu/Gajeel vs Sting/Rogue fight. That was awesome.")

I am watching the dub, though, and I don't believe Funimation has said anything about dubbing Fairy Tail 2014 yet, although I'd be shocked if they didn't. So, I guess I have a bit of time to wait for more episodes.

**Inferno Cop (1-6/13)**

This show is certainly something else. I'm not even sure if I'm enjoying the show or not. Episodes are only a few minutes each, so I'll probably finish watching it regardless. It's not what I expected at all, though. I'm not sure what I expected, to be honest.

I just binge-watched Claymore this weekend. Couldn't stop thinking of it as "The Witcher: The Anime"
>> ARTICLE
I've had a couple shows on the back burner which I was putting off because I was just to lazy to get around to watching them.

3 movies and an OVA/special.

**Persona 3: Midsummer Knight's Dream** 
Enjoyed it quite a bit, although not quite as good as the first. To much of the movie was focused on the new addition to the cast and his back story, when I would much rather of had focus on Yuki and what took place during the weeks between where the first movie ended and the second begun.

**Patema Inverted**
Definitely my favorite of what I watched, with the simplistic story, art, music, and the use of gravity in the movie, it solidified a spot as one of my favorite anime of all time.

Of everything I watched this week, Patema is a must watch because of how unique it is.

**The Girl Who Leapt Through Time**
I'll be honest, after hearing that this is an absolute classic, one of the best anime out there, along with it's under 100 ranking on MAL, I expected a lot more then what was delivered.

Sure it was a good movie, likable characters and what not.

But it sure as hell didn't live up to the status it had built.

**Cencoroll**

I knew a little about the OVA before watching it. I knew that KanaHana was in it... and that was about it.

It was a really fun short. Action, it had Cenco, HanaKana, moments that made you smile. It was fun and it made me excited to learn that a sequel is being produced at some point.

**Kyousogiga (TV)** (5/10)

Started this up after reading some threads on here that it was pretty entertaining.I wish I would've known not to watch Episode 0 but for now I have an idea of what is going on. Awesome animation which is what drew me to it (Thanks Toei!)

**Beyond the Boundary** (2/12)

Already interesting plot. I just picked this up and plan on more after I catch up on airing shows. Excited to see what else is in store.

**Sinsekai Yori** (18-25)

What an incredible series. There was so much development and twists that I couldn't stay away. IMO it is a thinker's anime, made me question the character's motives but most of their decisions were entirely realistic. Ended beautifully and I'm so glad I watched it. [spoilers](/s "Squera did nothing wrong!")

* **If Her Flag Breaks (1-13/13)** This was a strange case where if it had been a little bit better, I probably would have dropped it. Instead, it was so campy that I ended up enjoying it in spite of its shortcomings, although I would hardly recommend anyone going out of their way to watch it.

Since several (american) series are on break I had some free time and managed to watch 4 episodes of **[Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6114/Rainbow:_Nisha_Rokubou_no_Shichinin)**, from episode 12 to 15 (13 is just recap, so you could say I just watched 3), after putting it on hold for more than one month. Well, episode 12 was pretty important I guess, it probably would have had more effect on me if I had watched closer to 11. Then we have the time skip, which started pretty interesting, but it was handled really fast. I kinda feel like the anime could have ended on episode 14. The arc that starts on 15 didn't really pick my interest. 

Is it good? It felt like the same as before, like they didn't even change the antagonist.

I just finished the first season of **Yuru Yuri**, since /a/ has been overrun with it ever since the OVA came out and S3 was announced. It's pretty funny, and it's been a while since I watched this kind of show.

I also started **Ace of the Diamond** recently, which has been amazing. There's really nothing like a good sports anime once in a while. Pumps you up, gives you the warm fuzzies, and just keeps you watching. Ace of the Diamond has been pretty much completely stereotypical so far, but it's well done. 

I've also been re-watching a bit of **Saki** here and there, because it's so tanoshii.

My main watch this last week was the first episodes of [Kemono no Souja Erin](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=5420) and I'm having a blast but had to do a quick pause after some sad stuff happened. I'm not one of the "omg le feels" persons when watching merely AnoHana, but this show just hits where it hurts. Really digging the [opening song](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7zm73_kemono-no-souja-erin-op_shortfilms) as well. (couldn't find TV size on youtube)

I finally got around to watching [Inferno Cop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16774/Inferno_Cop) saving anime and it was great fun, but the best thing was the soundtrack.

Also slowly creeping my way through [Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time), I thought I'd hate it when it was first airing but [Golden Time spoilers](/s "Kaga got a lot more interesting. Her "breakdown" was adorable and I like her new self-awareness. Don't know what to make of ghost Banri yet") and I still have this strange urge to punch Tada Banri, even his name pisses me off.

I finished Anohana and Another. 

Another was really interesting... I had seen gifs of it before but didn't realize it was *that* show until later on. Second half reminded me of Mirai Nikki. Good stuff.

Anohana was very good as well. Ended up crying several times during the time I marathoned it.

**Tamako Market (5/12) -** Loving it so far, I'm confused as to why this anime didn't really catch on when shows with a similar charm have.

**Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku (Completed!) -** A lot like its parent season Lucky Star despite its short length. It's a great way to spend an hour and a half or so.

**Accel World (Completed!) -** I liked this show for the most part, but some things baffle me. It balances out to be a pretty average run.
>> ARTICLE
I watched these shows in the order posted and I watched them right after each show ended usually the next day.  Each series was the first time I have ever watched them, so they were not rewatch.

Shinsekai Yori (25/25) - Finished this last week on Wednesday, found it to be quite an emotional ride.  [spoiler] (/s "I do not agree with the queerat revolt, I can sympathize with their plight but I do not agree with their method of reaching a victory to allow them to have their own sovereignty.  I also do not agree with the human's system of weeding out the psychological imbalanced.")

Steins;Gate (24/24) + special (ep 25?) + the movie - Finished this on last week Thursday/Friday.  I don't typically like time traveling premise in most fiction, due in part to paradoxes that gets involved, but Steins;Gate has its explanation of how events in the past changes present events so I can somewhat accept their premise.  [spoiler] (/s "I really wish Ruka could have had his wish be permanent but I guess I have to play the VN.")

Kyousougiga (10/10) + ONA - I love the music and artistic design of this show, it reminds me of FLCL when I first watched it on Toonami.

Witch Craft Works (12/12) + OVA - Saw a webm/gif on /a/ regarding Kasumi's bro-con and it interested me.  This show was alright, did not have much expectation coming into the show and not reading the manga I did not understand what was going on.  I enjoyed it most of it due to the violent way they resolve things, but I think the series was out of focus on many of the characters that I couldn't really understand why the events were even occurring.

Kokoro Connect (13/13) + OVA - Just finished this before seeing this thread.  It was quite enjoyable, I have some qualms about the character's development such as: [spoiler] (/s "I felt they basically repeated many of the character's conflict such as Iori finding herself and Yui's androphobia but you can't really solve these problems within a day or two or however long it took them to stop the current heartseed event they are dealing with.")
>> ARTICLE
Spent some of my legitimate sick days watching [**Kotoura-san**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15379/Kotoura-san) to completion this past weekend. 

I was initially surprised at the amount of serious trauma drama in this high school romcom about a mind-reading psychic and a dirty-minded idiot, but instead of clashing, I found that the heavier moments gave me a greater appreciation for the lighthearted majority of the show. Character development and a decent conclusion are also pluses. Definitely worth a gander.
>> ARTICLE
Although I'm late to this post, I'm re-watching the Spice and Wolf series.  
  
Although it has been three years since I last watched the series (regrettably, the show is not as good as the novels), after having read all of the novels about half a year ago I felt it was time to dive back in because I love the setting and series so much.  
  
Not surprisingly, it is not as good as I remember it being when I first watched it, although the nostalgia trip is definitely good for me. Now I feel like I should reread all of the novels again.
>> ARTICLE
I just watched the 12 episodes of Brothers Conflict in one seat. The premise is so bad is good; a girl just acquires a 12-bishonen harem all for herself (they are her step-brothers) and has a difficult time rejecting them all. It had a couple of moments but overall another one of the bunch, not bad, not good. I hated the squirrel(?) the MC keeps as a pet.

Trinity Seven and the last 3/4ths of Nobunaga the Fool.  Time well spent.

**DeathNote(1-37)**

Watched all episodes in 3 days. It was quite a mix of experience. The story struggled in between and looks like drag [especially](/s "after death of L"). But towards at the end it was good. Overall a good anime for first timer.

Started with HxH last week, at ep 99 now

**Hayate the combat butler S1 1-41**, pretty decent show. Good comedy, decent story, high entertainment value. If it keeps going like this it'll land on either a 7 or 8.

**Haikyuu!! 1-14**, I'm in love. Such a good anime. The comedy is awesome, I've bursted out laughing so many times watching this show. I remember James n Brown's podcast dropped it during it's first cour, but I can't understand why. Love everything about it. Also european so it being a sport anime about an actual interesting sport (not baseball/american football/basketball) is a major plus, solid 9/10 atm. (Still need a good football show though)

So last week I watched the first 6 episodes of Katanagatari, this week I followed it up by watching the second half of the series. And it was pretty good. The first 10 episodes were pretty decent, simple pacing and not much going on. Those final 2 episodes were what makes me happy I watched the series. Without spoiling anything the series has a great ending, one that I didn't exactly see coming.

I also watched the first 6 episodes of Welcome to the NHK. So far it's decent. Once his Senpai (forgot her name) [spoiler](/s "showed up when they were shopping in Akihabara? I finally got hooked to the series.") But I don't think I've seen enough yet to reccomend it.

Kemonozume which I'm enjoying so far at episode 5. Came for unique (Ping-Pong-esque) art style but stayed for the forbidden romance. 7.5/10

**Cowboy Bebop**
Not sure how it took me so long to start watching this. I was a bit disappointed at first because I was hoping for something funny like Space Dandy, but now I'm familiar with the characters I quite enjoy it. The cinematography and soundtrack are great.

**Urusei Yatsura**
A really old series. I can't stop laughing at all the stuff Ataru goes through. I'm only 6 episodes in and he seems to already have earned the title of "unluckiest anime protagonist", and that's saying something!

La corda d'oro- It's cute and I like the classic music used. Also one I can watch with children around because it is not violent or bloody.

Shinsekai Yori:

I think this might be my favorite show of all time. I'm only through episode 15 but so far it tops my list. The way this post-apocalyptic society is run is very cruel, but unlike other anime where the evil is unjustifiable, the evil in shisnekai is a necessary evil. This makes the show what it is because I feel for both sides. Things have to be done, and they are. 10 of 10 would recommend to my grandma

Wasn't able to finish **Big O** this week. I got through to maybe episode 10. The episodic nature just makes it really hard to get through at times. It's a great show but the lack of an overarching plot is really bothersome. Yes the theme of the amnesiac city is overarching but it's not developed enough at all. It's brought up fairly consistently and it serves as a major part of the plot of individual episodes but there is no real development of the mystery beyond the episodic structure. It's making it a bit rough to get through. Another complaint I have is that most of the villains really suck. All of these small time, nasally villains who rant about stupid shit all the time are just horrible. They are dubbed terribly too. The chimera guy is the worst so far. He was just way too cliche and uninteresting. Also his character design and ones like him are just horrible. Far too cartoonish. The show is really demonstrating why it's a kid show. 

Yea sorry guys I actually had to drop this. I'll probably come back to it at some point but I just can't force myself to watch it.

**Starship Troopers(6/6)** So... I didn't know this existed until a few days ago. I legitimately only found this by glancing through Sunrise's list of works in the 80's on Wikipedia. Doubletaked when I saw this title and immediately googled it. Turns out that Sunrise made an OVA adaptation of parts of Heinlein's Starship Troopers in the 80's. Who knew. For an incredibly obscure 80's show, I was really shocked by how much I enjoyed this. For starters the soundtrack is pretty much all english with OP's and Ed's included. And it's the type of cheesy 80's music I adore. Here's[1]   a taste. Which brings me to the animation. Actually pretty decent really. The character designs are generally decent with the exception of the girl featured in the OP, Carmencita, who is... well the ugliest female I've ever seen in anime. Absolutely the worst lapse in character design ever outside of maybe Kanon 2002. The action sequences in this show are really quite good and actually GAR as fuck. Plus we get the armored suits that the book talks about but the 1997 movie never had.

Moving on to plot and character's. For those who have read the book, this isn't a full or very faithful adaption from what I remembered. Most of the OVA is about the time spent in boot camp with one real battle in all of the 6 episodes. It's really the only anime I've ever seen featuring very western seeming bootcamp sequences. You know... strict drill leader who makes everyone run laps and crap. It's pretty great. That said the writing of this show is great. The plot is very well paced to me and the character's are fantastic. Everything just feels very well written and designed. Despite it's length it's a fairly moving tale of camaraderie and bonding between soldiers to be.

I'd definitely recommend this show to anyone who has read the book or anyone who likes Sunrise's older works. It's really a very unknown jewel of a show. I think the show is actually very comparable to Gunbuster with the caveat that it's the real robot version. It has very comparable training episodes with a leadup to real fighing towards the end. The difference being that Starship Trooper's spends more time in boot camp and it's doesn't really conclude with the end of the conflict like Gunbuster did. Regardless it does have a very satisfying ending.

**Sidonia no Kishi(13/13)**  Finished this after watching it for weeks on end with a friend when we could find the time. Not all that much to say. The overall plot was fairly interesting I suppose. The animation was balls even if you try and say that you just have to get used to it. The backgrounds looked fairly good but the decision to use CG for character's? Horrible. They all look really terrible and it stands out pretty badly from the hand drawn backgrounds. The mecha CG works decently and I didn't have many issues with it. Of course I prefer my hand drawn mecha infinitely more but what are you gonna do. The character's were fairly mediocre but serviceable. Funnily enough I though that the androgynous character was the best. The show does a horrific job of telegraphing all of the major plot points. It's predictable beyond belief with a showering of death flags easily predicting any bad event. Overall this show was incredibly mediocre if somewhat enjoyable.

**Armored Trooper Votoms(1-4/51)**  Back to what  I really enjoy: 80's real robot shows. And this one is really good so far. I was pretty shocked to find that this show isn't actually about a giant space war which is a breath of fresh air coming from UC gundam. It's been showing very good plot progression so far with no episodic hijinks rearing their ugly head. And I doubt that will happen. Animation is standard fair for the 80's but it works for the show quite well. The setting so far is really interesting as well and very dirty which works great with the animation. The mecha design is really cool and inspired. Very realistic but the action is still very satisfying.

> Starship Troopers(6/6)

I've been looking for this for years, i have never been able to find it, where do you locate it at?
>> ARTICLE
I sent my link to you.
>> ARTICLE
It's a really hard one to find, and the place I watched it on no longer has it available.
>> ARTICLE
There are a few pretty bad links out there but it can be watched.
>> ARTICLE
Votoms is goood. You're right, it's interesting that it takes place after a huge war rather than in the middle of one. Each of the show's four arcs has a distinctly different feel to the others, too, which is cool.

If you're interested in the animation, you should look it up on Anipages (when you've finished watching it, so you don't get spoiled!). From memory, Ettinger wrote a big post going into detail about the different people who were involved in the designs and animation.
>> ARTICLE
Yea it is quite interesting. I had heard the thing about the arcs and I'm looking forward to that. Something to keep it fresh I suppose. Out of curiosity, what sequels/spinoffs to Votoms are good? I know it has a huge amount which makes it pretty confusing. I've heard very good things about Armor Hunter Mellowlink but not much about anything else.  

Thanks I didn't know that site existed! I took a look around and it seems quite interesting. I'll be sure to check it out for some of the 80's shows I plan to watch.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I did the franchise, but from what I remember

* Mellowlink is, I think, kind of the jewel in the crown of the spin-offs, a really neat (if quite simple) story of revenge and a guy fighting mecha while on foot, with some lovely mechanical animation.
* [Big Battle](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2584/Soukou_Kihei_Votoms:_Big_Battle) is basically just an additional, unnecessary but fun episode of the TV series, so you can watch that when you've done the main show.
* [The Last Red Shoulder](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2583/Soukou_Kihei_Votoms:_The_Last_Red_Shoulder) is set between the first and second arcs of the TV show, but was made later and can safely be left until after the show as well. I remember enjoying it, though.
* [Shining Heresy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2586/Soukou_Kihei_Votoms:_Kakuyaku_taru_Itan) is a direct sequel to the TV show, and I'm not sure how I feel about it. It's not *bad* and it has some cool elements, but I'm not sure it has the spark of the original material. I recommend seeing it and seeing what you think of it.
* The modern (which means 3DCG ATs) OVAs [Alone Again](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8250/Soukou_Kihei_Votoms:_Koei_Futatabi) and [Phantom Arc](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8017/Soukou_Kihei_Votoms:_Gen-ei_Hen) bolt one last conclusion onto Chirico's story. 3DCG for the ATs is a bit of a tough pill to swallow but it is interesting to see Takahashi returning for one last time to the story.
* [Pailsen Files](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3256/Soukou_Kihei_Votoms:_Pailsen_Files) is a prequel to the TV show, but the kind of prequel where you want to have seen the main show first. This too has 3DCG ATs but they do at least use them for some pretty wild battles. I remember actually quite liking this one because some of the battles are cool and it feels more like a separate story in its own right than a supplement.
* [Case;Irvine](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8248/Soukou_Kihei_Votoms:_Case;_Irvine) and [Votoms Finder](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8249/Votoms_Finder) were two separate stand-alone projects to make something inspired by Votoms but also a bit different and fresh. If you approach them more as stand-alone short mecha stories with good action than as 'Votoms anime', they're both actually quite fun (I think). IIRC Takahashi has indicated in interviews that he eventually got quite tired of being asked to return to Votoms and make more of it, and in some ways I think these projects, with new creative teams going in new directions, are probably a more productive direction.

Yeah, Anipages is great. The author's one of the few people writing about anime in English who I believe genuinely knows quite a lot (not something I would ever claim about myself), and I often look something up there once I finish watching it to see if he has written about it. I don't always agree with his assessments of the value/achievement of things, but the amount of interesting detail about animators and animation is fantastic, and in my better moments I much prefer reading interesting writers whose views sometimes differ from mine than boring writers who reaffirm my own prejudices.
>> ARTICLE
Alright I'll take a look at a few of those titles. I'm a bit dubious about the idea of a modern day title in Votoms but I can see for myself.

Does he mostly write on old stuff? Just a bit curious. I find older animation more interesting anyways. Are all the reviews he posts spoilery?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Ettinger deliberately writes about old stuff so much as there's just more old stuff to write about (if you think about it!). He will on occasion talk about new anime, like Space Dandy. I think he's mostly driven by interest in animation. Which explains how his posts can be kind of spoilery -- he's unlikely to go into a super in-depth discussion of the narrative conclusion of a show, but from memory he might make offhand references to plot events in the course of discussing a particular episode's animation staff, or offer some opinions about what he thought of the story.
>> ARTICLE
Ah alright. Yea I read his write up of the Devilman OVA's and that sounds about right.  A lot of talk about the animators involved as well including some really interesting stuff ( in Devilman's case that some of the animators did a lot of Ghibli movies as well). And yea there certainly is more to talk about with old stuff. It's probably just an area he knows more about as well.

**[Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!

It seems like they can still be able to continue the story. S3 when? Although, I doubt they'd make one. And if they did, they'd make Haruhi S3 first! A lot of people seemed to be disappointed by the ending, but I wasn't. I thought it was good. 10/10 would watch again!

**Grisaia no Kaijitsu (The Fruit of Grisaia) 1-12/12**

So i added this show to my plan to watch months ago since it had the harem and school tag on it and didn't read anything about it. I read no descriptions and never heard of the show so I literally had no idea what it was about going into it, which actually made it a super enjoyable ride. Throughout the first episode it had this darkish tone and atmosphere so I immediately knew something was up. The fun part was I didn't know anything about the show so I thought maybe the girls had secret supernatural powers or were going to go yandere and murder everyone. The unexplained eerie vibe it had going for it probably made me enjoy the show way more than if I had previous knowledge of the series.

I really enjoyed the psychological aspects the show had and the comedy in the first couple of episodes was pretty hilarious. I've seen that many of the people who have read the visual novel complained about certain aspects but as someone who went into the show blind I though it was pretty alright. My only complaint with it is that the ending felt really stupid to me, the plan they came up with made no sense when thinking about it. Overall a very solid watch, can't wait for season 2.

**Nisekoi 1-5/20**

A fun RomCom so far but I don't think it would be half as good as it is without the shaft visuals. The show hasn't really hooked me yet but I always appreciate how well Shaft can animate a show and it so immersive. I plan on finishing the show off before season 2 starts.

>> ARTICLE
**Ginatama** (26/201)

Man, everyone was right, this show *does* get better around the 25th episode! I mean, it was pretty good before, but I noticed a bump in quality on episode 25, which is probably the funniest episode yet. And from what I heard, it just keeps getting funnier and funnier as it goes along. I'm looking forward to getting deeper into it!
>> ARTICLE
[**Gankutsuou**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/239/Gankutsuou) **24/24**

Was very intrigued by the artstyle and premise of this show, having read The Count of Monte Cristo, so much so that I moved it instantly to the top of my to watch pile. 

While the artstyle didn't let me down except for some dodgy CGI (most of the time the cars), the series did somewhat. It started off so well, as the premise is so interesting and they did pretty well with this. They had the book to rely on, so the characters were solid as well and some of the artwork was stunningly gorgeous, while te soundtrack had some real standouts ([Kaishou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRnv0GYNG-4) is one intense insert song)

But about halfway the show it set in for some decline as [Gankutusou](/s "they started to seriously deviate and cut plotlines from the book in pretty jarring ways"). The storyline took a nosedive for the worst, especially towards the very end. [Gankutusou](/s "I mean come on, first Fernand shoots Albert and the same episode he begs the Count to spare his life? Ridiculously inconsistent and that's just one example.")

All in all I did enjoy a large part of the show, but as I neared the end the show annoyed me more and more where the entire story of the Count of Monte Cristo builds towards a huge climax. Ultimately, it was nice enough, but it disappointed me a little.

Verdict: ***7/10***

[**Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei**] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/20785/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei) **26/26**

After this I needed a break from 'heavy' shows to a show where I kinda knew what I would be getting

Suffice to say it delivered. By any standards of a normal show it would be pretty shit, but if you embrace what it is and treat it as a bit of a parody, it's pretty entertaining.

**Valkyria Chronicles + OVA 9**  
I'm kind of dissapointed. I liked how this series started, but then was massive quality drop. It got better before the end of the series, but still, some episodes felt like worst kind of filler, bringing nothing to story or characters, just something to pass the time. Some characters felt out of place, some had unreasonably quick changes of heart, just because. I don't know how Imperial Army got that far with invasion, when they couldn't hit anything, it felt really silly just watching them shooting.  
Watching the series I was often thinking about opportunities missed by creators, where things could be developed better, and where they put focus on the wrong things. Still, even with all this I quite enjoyed the series, it was fun ride, and I will rewatch it for sure, but it's not the series which I could just rewatch on the second day after finishing, I'll just give it some time, maybe few years.

I'm currently watching Mononoke (not Princess Mononoke, just Mononoke). It's like a feudal Japanese drug trip. The main character doesn't have a name, and gives absolutely zero fucks about how creepy this show is.

Finished Noragami some time mid week  had a blast watching it loved hiyori and the jokes were solid!  had to watch it after seeing the long fall gif which i cant seem to find.

**Welcome to the NHK**

Clannad - Fairly generic slice of life, but enjoyable none the less. 6/10

Clannad: After Story - Amazing up until ep.22 where they just completely shat on all the amazing tear-filled moments that had taken place before hand. Really disapointed. 5/10

Outbreak Company: I liked the anime and manga references, but the MC and supporting cast are a joke. 2/10

Shinseki Yori - Just started this, enjoying it, but rather confused. ?/10

Hagure Yuusha No Estetica: It was all right, interesting concept of starting after the MC is already a hero. Way too mucj nudity for my liking though 6/10

Noragami: Loved this, great art and I love the character interactions and how the gods do jobs for 5 yen. 7/10

So yesterday I found out the Urobutcher will be a writing an episode of ***Wooser's Hand-To-Mouth Life***. After laughing about it on twitter, someone linked me to the amazing [*Wooser's S2 ED*](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x19cid2_wooser-s2-ed_shortfilms) sung by Mamoru Miyano, and yeah now I'm watching *Wooser's*. It's very short and very silly, but it's a pretty interesting aesthetic that I don't see very often. I'd definitely recommend this as something to leave on in the background while you work and just let CR loop through the episodes.

P.S. [I found a near little fandub of the first episode of *Wooser's*, with Wooser being played by a Brit. Check it out!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N-gb5_xTXU)

**Mobile Suit Gundam 00 S2** (3/25)

Finished the first season yesterday and it was great. I didn't like it at first because the characters were either uninteresting or annoying, but after the first 10 episodes or so it starts being a very fun ride. I recommend watching the first season if you want to watch something that has a (mostly) competent story that takes itself seriously, loads of politics and great visuals and animations. 7.5/10

But oh boy, Season 2.

I can't put in words how fucking annoyed I am [about](/s "making Lockon's twin brother(who was seen once or twice in a flashback in S1) the new meister. But that isn't the main problem, it's unsettling how he is literally Lockon in every way possible and just accepts everything around him that is happening because the writers wanted Lockon back or something. Did they think that would be less of a cop out than bullshit reviving him after what happened? I have no idea why or who asked for this, but it's absolutely disgusting") Whoever thought that was a good idea in any way deserves to get punched in the face. That being said, those 3 episodes were otherwise decent. 

**Mushishi Zoku Shou** (10/10)

In short, I am disappointed.

 It's focused a lot more on the episodic characters instead of Ginko and his mushis which I don't care about making it boring at times, the gloomy atmosphere that S1 had is nonexistent, it has a lot of weird comedic moments that felt out of place and were never funny(while S1 had subtle ones that I found enjoyable), and there wasn't a single interesting or surprising ending to an episode.

That being said, it was still good. It was still relaxing and mushis were interesting so I give it a 7/10.

**Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?** (4/10)

Obnoxious characters, obnoxious humor, uninteresting and boring storyline because the characters are all unbeatable gary stus. I seriously wonder what's the appeal.
>> ARTICLE
**Full Metal Panic episodes 10-12:**

Bog standard action series, with some romance thrown in. I've seen this in anime so many times. I guess for 2001, it was good, especially on the art front. Some of the CGI really reminds me of Blue Submarine No. 6, but a tad better, also because there's less of it, thankfully.

It's not bad, but it's just *so* average, and doesn't have the comedy I was seeking. Might finish, might skip to Fumoffu.

Also I started to watch [The Tatami Galaxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=7785) today. The first ep was very good so far.

^(I also watched a few hentais.)
>> ARTICLE
*The Tatami Galaxy* is a pretty slow burn, but it explodes into some fireworks towards the end (literally *and* metaphorically.) That's not to say that the earlier episodes are bad - they're pretty fuckin' quality. But the last three episodes elevate the series overall. I think you're in for a good time.

>I also watched a few hentais.

It's a pretty good show. It took around six episodes to grow on me, but once I got into it I really enjoyed it.

That said, the first few episodes are just awful in my opinion. If you can gut through/enjoy those episodes, then the rest is great.
>> ARTICLE
It was definitely a good watch. Nothing too crazy and very entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
Finished watching Psycho-Pass, and watched the first episode of Evangelion.

Psycho-Pass really deserved the hype it gets on this sub. I hadn't picked it up yet because I really don't care for crime/detective shows. I ended up watching the gorier bits through my fingers. Nasty stuff. Overall, the series was depressing, disturbing, and hopeful all at the same time. IMO, it had a really satisfying ending.

I'm picking up Evangelion now because it was recommended. I haven't had it spoiled aside from hearing that it's 'mind-rapey.' It still looks a bit cheesy, but I'm only at the very beginning of the series. One thing that's noticeable from the one episode that I've seen is that when the protagonist is asked to save the day, instead of going "Hell yeah!" and jumping at the chance like the characters in Gurren Laggan (the only other Mecha I've seen), he freaks out like any normal person would. That's just a thought though. 
>> ARTICLE
2 things to keep in mind watching NGE:

1) It's an old and "original" series. Elements that seem cheesy are often one of the first implementations of the trope (such as Rei's character).

2) You're right about Shinji's attitude; the rest of the cast will be examined through the lens of "what real life circumstances would need to exist for X character to behave like Y?" It will help you dislike them less (or maybe even like them more).

Took awhile for it to get there for me but the last 3 episode really sealed the deal. Still need to watch the movie.
>> ARTICLE
I watched a crapton of anime this week, so theres a lot here, I'm only going to talk a little about each one so this isn't too long. Just be wary that my comments have vague spoilers, but nothing explicit.

**RahXephon** *Completed 26/26*

Took me *six entire months* to watch this from start to finish. The first 20 episodes were really taxing to get through, the mystery wasn't compelling and the plot was lacklustre because of the degree of obfuscation they covered it with. The only thing that kept me going was the characters, and I wasn't impressed by most of them, just a select few.

That said, the series clicked for me around episode 20 and then I marathoned the rest this week, I do have to say it had a very satisfying ending and in the end it was a worthwhile watch. 

**Spirited Away** *Completed*

First time ever going into Ghibli movies!! This was the first one I chose and it was a good choice. I loved it, the visuals were amazing, the animation fantastic and the art super detailed, which I suppose is something to now expect from all Ghibli movies. I can parse quite a lot of the surface allegory going on in this one but I'll need to think it over to analyse more. I wasn't so fond of the quick resolution of an ending but I can see what they were going for.

**Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa** *Completed*

Second Ghibli film. I loved this *so freaking much,* possibly even more than Spirited Away. I can't even put into words the emotions and sense of awe and scale I had while watching this, nor can I do it justice with my feeble comments. This is a must watch for anyone.

**Ga-Rei: Zero** *Watching 4/12*

I've heard people saying how good the first episode or two of this series is. To be absolutely honest I thought it was terrible 3edgy5me bullshit because none of the conflict had any weight since the characters were all props which were created in order to be killed within the span of one episode, nor was the action particularly interesting to look at either. I was almost about to drop the series there, but episodes 3 and 4 redeemed it in a really strong way, going back to the origin and how the two girls met. Lot of solid drama and the building of an endearing relationship going on here, pity that because of ep 1 and 2 we already know what terrible things are about to happen and ruin everything.

**Hanasaku Iroha: Home Sweet Home** *Completed*

Watched HanaIro while it was airing, so this movie was a good refresher to get to know all the characters again. I must say I absolutely loved getting to see Satsuki's backstory and her rebellious teenage phase, it was relatable and understandable and pretty grounded in reality. I was less fond of the actual conflict engineered in the present-day scenes, it felt slightly on the melodrama side of things. Still, Ohana getting to learn about her mother was brilliant, I probably would have enjoyed this more if the series was still fresh in my mind, I had trouble remembering everyone, its been like 3 years.

**Hayate no Gotoku! Heaven Is a Place on Earth** *Completed*

The second season of Hayate came out in 2009 and I didn't watch any more of the series til the terrible 3rd and 4th seasons in late 2012/early 2013 which were handled by manglobe rather than JCStaff or SynergySP. This movie was actually the first Hayate entry done by manglobe, and it wasn't so bad, so I can't really say "manglobe are what ruined Hayate". 

It's just that I guess I have just become disenchanted with the franchise over the years, I loved the first two seasons, but I really hate the attitude the anime has with skipping the interesting arcs of the manga to get to more of the tame slice of life stuff and then pretty much outright telling the viewer to 'go read the manga'.

**Fullmetal Alchemist** *Watching 6/51*

Have already seen Brotherhood, going back to this in order to watch all the major Bones shows from 00's. RahXephon down, this and Eureka Seven next. I'm liking it so far and not much other than to say other than that the pacing is slower and theres a bit more "filler", which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

**Love Live! School Idol Project** *Watching 3/13*

This is the best thing ever. Words cannot describe.

**Space Dandy** *Completed 13/13*

Finished the first season in time for season 2. Consistently meh apart from a select few episodes, the 13th episode was really good though.

**Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei** *Completed 13/13*

I've been slowly watching this over time. I must say that I still enjoy the series but this season was not as consistently funny as the first, while also lacking the character introductions every episode which gave the first season a lot more structure and sense of progression. The visuals are even more experimental this time, and theres some sketches that are even better than season one, such as the Commodre Perry one and the detective one.
>> ARTICLE
It sucks that you watched Brotherhood first, because the first Fullmetal gives a lot more background on characters that Brotherhood, seems to just skim over.

The anime original ending (that completes its self with "Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa") is well worth watching the whole series despite having watched brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm liking it so far and not much other than to say other than that the pacing is slower and theres a bit more "filler", which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

You are entirely correct. The first FMA was slower paced, fleshed out the character interactions more, and then... ran out of source material and started making shit up. That's when it comes off the rails a bit, but until then, it's not bad at all and compares favourably to Brotherhood. 
>> ARTICLE
>pity that because of ep 1 and 2 we already know what terrible things are about to happen and ruin everything.

Considering Ga-Rei: Zero was released as a prequel to an ongoing manga and aimed at fans of said material which was quite popular, many if not most people watching it at the time in Japan were already aware of it.

I really need to read Nausicaa, own it in the 4 volume release.
>> ARTICLE
>Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa

Funny you should mention that, as it has now been exactly one week since I saw that movie. I started a Ghibli "club" with a few friends with the goal of going through the most notable films(today was Laputa). And yeah, I agree, I loved Nausicaa. I've seen a number of anime movies, but Nausicaa is one of the very few that actually feel like proper films. It's just great.

>Love Live! School Idol Project

This was one of the first shows that I watched while it was airing, and at the time I liked it very much. It's very, very formulaic, but if I had to pick the most fun show to start waifu wars or shipping contests over, it's this one. 

Oh, that reminds me, I probably need to finish S2 soon. I'm a few episodes behind on that.
>> ARTICLE
>**Ga-Rei: Zero** *Watching 4/12*

>I've heard people saying how good the first episode or two of this series is.

Strange...I love Ga-Rei: Zero and tend to pay attention anytime it's mentioned, but I don't recall seeing people describing the first episode as exceptionally good or anything. I've definitely seen it described as "shocking" or "wtf" or things along those lines, and I agree with those descriptions. It's certainly a memorable and interesting way to start a series though. First episode aside, how Ga-Rei: Zero ends is the most memorable part of it and IMO is much more impactful if you're not familar with it's sequel manga, Ga-Rei, before watching the anime. Hope you enjoy it!

>**RahXephon** *Completed 26/26*

>Took me six entire months to watch this from start to finish.

As someone that loved Evangelion, did Rahxephon's many similarities to Evangelion bother you at all? Did you ever check out the [comparison site](http://evaxephon.com/ComparisonGallery/gallery1.html) made by a fan of both series? 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I have heard people talking about Ga-Rei: Zero on twitter so thats about it. I didn't pay too close attention to avoid being spoiled, but those episodes seemed positively received.

In the case of RahXephon, its true that the show is clearly Post-Evangelion, however this wasn't a problem so much for me after maybe one or two episodes. My problems were mostly with much of the series taking such a formulaic monster-of-the-week structure that seemingly had no end in sight. (Evangelion did this too, but there was a sense of buildup due to the angel numbering and the execution was better imo). I'll check out that comparison site since theres probably even more similarities I missed.
>> ARTICLE
> Nausicaa

By far my favorite and most watched. Princess Mononoke is damn close though and would definitely recommend as your next Ghibli.

> Love Live

Internet High Five. Just finished S1.
>> ARTICLE
I do plan on watching Princess Mononoke next!

Yeah, and Love Live is brilliant. Those first three episodes actually had quite an impact on me, which wasn't expected at all from this series.
>> ARTICLE
Nausicaa is easily my favorite Ghibli film. You should read the manga that Miyazaki wrote, the movie only covers maybe 1/5th of the whole story and it's amazing.

Yeah, I have been doing some background reading about it. I'm not sure if I will get around to the manga anytime soon, but its definitely a long term plan.

Just watched it last week! 

Was a very interesting show that had a nice balance of characterization and economics. I will admit that sometimes a lot of the stuff flew over my head because of how fast it can move at times, but what made it interesting was how they integrated economics with character development. They weren't completely different elements of the show and they did a good job of constantly trying to integrate the two. I also just realized that the times where I wasn't interested was when they were talking about economics for the sake of economics. I needed a reason to *care* about these things. 

A good example of this would be in the second season where [](/s "they started to talk about supply and demand. Okay cool, supply and demand but this isn't interesting me. Oh, but wait, This is an important detail because it has to do with how Lawrence has to try to get back Horo from that other guy! Got it, now you have my interest.")

I personally felt the first couple of episodes of the first season were just really slow. I will admit I was having some difficulty getting into it. When they got to the second arc with the armor though, that's when I got hooked. I really preferred the second season to the first as they had some really tense situations and did a good deal really honing their relationship.

Too bad there is no third season. Was going to be the one that could have wrapped up the story nicely :(.
>> ARTICLE
I see nothing but praise for this show here, does it live up to the hype? I'll probably check it out eventually but I'm curious how good it actually is.
>> ARTICLE
If you like a good,easy paced story set in medieval times then this is definitely the show for you (you will have to use your head a lot though because economics is an important element of this show) 
The show is excellently written with very witty dialogue that you would normally expect from a Shakespeare play.

>> ARTICLE
I guess it depends. I know people who love it and people who don't much care for it, both for the same reason, that being the characters. It's an extremely character driven show, so if you don't fall in love with both of the main characters then you probably won't like the show. On the other hand, if you fall for the two of them then you'll either be buying the novels after you finish the anime or suffering from severe depression as the anime doesn't finish the story. The plots are really just excuses to get these two characters to keep talking and travelling with one another : P I don't even like romance, but it's my personal favourite. 
>> ARTICLE
I had to read the novels after I finished the anime. Well worth it. I'd recommend checking them out if you're eager to know how the story ends.

**Princess Tutu 10/26**

This is surprisingly interesting so far, I've been thinking of getting into shoujo since I've seen very little of it. This is definitely the most girly show I've seen but it's nice to watch something that wouldn't normally appeal to me for a change. So far the characters seem pretty interesting and multi dimensional but it's difficult for me to take seriously sometimes when they have ballet dance offs with sad piano music playing. It seems like it may or may not take a darker turn with the forshadowing of Fakirs death. Just as a side note, I was thinking of trying revolutionary girl Utena after this, I don't hear about it much but it seems to be pretty well liked, whats the general consensus on it?

**Seirei no Moribito 3/26**

I've been getting sick of anime tropes so I've been looking for things that don't really *feel* like anime (same reason I started Princess Tutu) and so far this seems like exactly what I was looking for. The main character is well above the age of 20 which is very unusual and so far it seems to generally reject silly tropes. After watching Saraiya Goyou a week ago I've been very lucky to find another very nice historical seinen to watch, looking forward to seeing where it goes.
>> ARTICLE
Seirei no Moribito is pretty amazing, I loved it.

It turns into a slice of life show a little ways through, but picks up on the action towards the end. Not to say that the slice of life is bad, it's excellent actually. It's really important to build up the characters so you actually care for them and they do a pretty solid job of it IMO.
>> ARTICLE
According to MAL, Princess Tutu is 38 episodes. I just went to check though, and I can only find 26 episodes out there. I was planning to watch this soon, does anyone know if there's more?
>> ARTICLE
That has something to do with how it aired on television, MAL also says its 16 minutes per episode I'm not sure on exactly why but it's normal episode length and 26 episodes long if you're watching it normally. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, strange, but the math checks out (38 16-minute episodes is approximately equivalent to 26 23-minute episodes). Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
**Mawaru Penguindrum**

Just finished the first episode and it was pretty fucking good. Only reason I picked it up was because the name was cool.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, same here. The name caught my attention at first but then I read the reviews and went in expecting something awesome. Into 14 episode right now and still waiting for awesome. It's kind of... weird. Maybe it's just me but it feels like the whole show is in codes and riddles and rather than just enjoying the show, I need to figure the meaning behind everything and it just makes my brain hurt. Right now, I'm just forcing myself to continue because I want to see why so many people liked it.
>> ARTICLE
Penguindrum is a good show because it doesn't spoonfeed you everything, but there is still a lot going on , and everything in it does have meaning and a purpose. This is because it was made by Kunikiko Ikuhara, who is also responsible for Revolutionary Girl Utena, which is similar in this aspect. 

I really hope he keeps making Anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching this the last couple days and am on episode 13. It continues to remain pretty fucking good. The little blue penguins continue to be hilarious and adorable, while the story actually gets pretty dark and takes some twisted turns.
>> ARTICLE
i loved that show the entire way through, but i honestly feel like it gets better as it goes on, all the way up until the end. that show is quite a ride
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari 6/12**  
I have been putting this show off for a while and so far I love the art and the dialogue in the show. There isn't as many fight scenes as I thought, but the ones that do happen after pretty good. I do think the MC is a bit overpowered. The idea of the insect, animal and bird squad for the Maniwani ninja corps is pretty interesting as well, [](/s "but even with their ninpos they don't seem to do much other than die in 1 second after a fight starts."). Togame's Cheerio punch is also super cute. Looking forward to the [](/s "fight against his sister the next episode since apparently she is stupidly strong").

**Aquarion Evol 7/26**  
I'm not much of a mecha guy, and this show didn't really change that so far. To be honest the romance in it is pretty cheesy and needs to be toned down a bit. The only thing I really like about the show so far is the [opening song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YrxlNFJCTE). I don't know if I will continue this or not. 
>> ARTICLE
 [I want to put something into perspective for you,](/s "the insect squad weren't weak, not at all. Nanami is literally strong.")

Also enjoy the rest of the series, the final episode of Katanagatari is so damn good.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, watching Aquarion Evol before the prequel? It's not really necessary, although you might appreciate the story a bit more. The style is more of an old-school mecha anime with monster of the week, which might not be up your alley. The [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DAk5P_6Rg) for Sousei no Aquarion is fantastic though.
>> ARTICLE
I started The Tatami Galaxy a few days ago. Four episodes in and I'm really impressed with the format of the story and the art style. Very refreshing.

Finished Shinsekai Yori today. I don't know if I unintentionally spoiled myself at some point in the past or if I'm a clairvoyant, but for some reason I had a feeling early on that  [Very Major Spoiler](/s "the monster rats used to be humans"), so that reveal had a slightly lessened impact on me. Nonetheless, it was an excellent and enthralling show. Probably one of the most engaging examples of world-building I can think of, and the progression of events from beginning to end was so satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, you're not alone on the Shin Sekai Yori boat. The foreshadowing was great, but it did allow for the viewer to guess [spoiler](/s "the secret of the queerats fairly easily") Still a great show and great ending.
>> ARTICLE
I finished **Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex**. Overall it was a pretty great show. The Stand Alone filler episodes were, for the most part, pretty horrendous. The organ thieves episode, the assassin that uses money to kill people, that awful episode where the guy falls in love with an android, etc. The only Stand Alone episodes I can remember enjoying were the bank one where the chief is a badass and the African druglord one. Luckily, the Complex episodes more than made up for the terrible filler. That six episode streak at the end had my eyes glued to the screen, and the conclusion was excellent. I'm definitely looking forward to starting 2nd Gig. I recommend this show if you're looking for a well-written sci fi detective story that doesn't hold your hand and you have a decent stomach for tolerating filler (think Cowboy Bebop levels of filler, except it's not actually good like Bebop). As an added bonus, the dub was incredibly good- no need to watch the sub for this one.

As an aside, is it ever explained in the movies or something why the Major looks so slutty? It was one of the only things in the show that really bothered me. It just felt like incredibly forced fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
Usually I don't get to partake in these, but my girlfriend and I finally finished the Alfheim arc of SAO in preparation for the upcoming season. We watched the first arc way back in 2012 when the show aired, but we just kind of fell out of it and *never* finished until just now.

I'm really glad we did though. I wasn't a fan of Asuna's character change or how completely rapey and disturbing it got, but I did enjoy the arc overall. I may have had my opinion colored by just enjoying the setting/characters of SAO again after two years, though.

Finished **Girls und Panzer**. It was better than expected, but it doesn't really deserve its popularity. I do like the OP though.

Started rewatching **Code Geass**. I needed to reconfirm how good it is. It really is amazing.

**Ima, soko ni Iru Boku (Now and Then, Here and There) (13/13 finished)** - Last week I had only seen one episode of this, but I was already digging it. Well, after that, it only got better. This show turned into one of the best post-apocalypse stories I've seen to date, and not just in anime. The world-building is done in a very "show, don't tell" kind of way, and while there is exposition, it's not overused. Characters rarely explain their thoughts in detail. Basically, the show dodges all of the stuff that annoys me about more recent story-driven shows. The reason for this is probably that the show is 15 years old, but this also has it drawbacks. Namely, the main character is the most generic run-of-the-mill cookie-cutter hero I've ever seen. However, as this is not that common anymore(nowadays characters are more self-aware and gloomy), it didn't bother me that much. All in all, a very enjoyable show from a time when anime was done in a slightly different way.

**Aoi Hana (Sweet Blue Flowers) (8/11)** - Another show based on a manga by Takako Shimura, the author of Hourou Musuko(the show I gushed about last week). This show, however, is about girls' love instead of complex gender identities. Aoi Hana doesn't sport a cast of characters as amazingly mature as the one of Hourou Musuko, but that might be a strength. However, it's not exceptionally novel in other ways either. It's occasionally very shoujo in its characters and their interactions: The main character is a shy girl and then there's the tall short-haired girl whom everyone is attracted to. There is a slight divergence in that there is a second main character who seems very out of place, though. And that serves to keep things interesting. In addition, the show alludes to classical works of literature in some interesting ways and it looks extremely nice(some of JC Staff's best work in my opinion). Worthwhile show for anyone who likes yuri.

**Kino no Tabi (Kino's Journey) (13/13 finished)** - I watched all of this, sans the "movies", in a single day. That's how good it was. Kino's Journey is a journey in several ways. First of all, it's literal. The story revolves around Kino and her travels in an episodic way. Every episode is a different story with the same main character. Secondly, the show is a journey into philosophy, as every episode usually has a theme of some sort. They're not fables, however, because there are no messages, per se. Every episode just sort of explores an idea and then invites the viewer to think about it, as Kino is not one to give many answers. The best example of this is probably the subtitle of the show, "The Beautiful World", in the sentence "The world is not beautiful; therefore, it is" shown at the beginning of one of the early episodes. Thirdly, this episode was a journey for me as a viewer, because I could never guess where the show was taking me. The first few episodes are some of my favourite episodes in all of anime, and the later episodes were even better. Hell, I had to revise my scoring system for anime just to make sure that Kino's Journey has its deserved spot near the very top. Excellent, excellent show. And even when you forget about the story and philosophy, the show has occasionally beautiful art and very nice music.

**Natsume Yuujinchou (Natsume's Book of Friends) (13/13 finished)** - A show based on a fantasy shoujo manga. Sounds interesting, doesn't it? Yes, yes it is. It's not quite as amazing as the other shows I watched this week, but it was very enjoyable. With Hiroshi Kamiya voicing the lead character, what could go wrong? Not much, but his character is not the most intriguing either. Despite this being based on a shoujo manga, Natsume is pretty much a regular main character: clumsy and mostly powerless. Luckily, his sidekick, Nyanko-sensei(whose real name is Madara), is hilarious. Also, because he's a powerful youkai, he usually saves Natsume's ass from danger. And that brings us to the story. The story of this show revolves around the fact that Natsume can see youkai, who are usually invisible to human beings. The youkai cause problems for each other as well as humans, and it's Natsume's job to take care of these problems. Not a terribly innovative premise, but the show does have some very good aspects. Most importantly for me, the youkai designs are surprisingly varied and nice-looking. Some look like humans(usually wearing masks or other odd ornaments on their faces), others look like animals. There's the big and furry bear-like Santo(and his friend, the catfish Mikuri), the humongous horse-faced Misuzu and the beautiful Hinoe. The story is mostly episodic when it comes to the youkai(most are not recurring characters), but Natsume also has human friends and classmates, who are mostly recurring characters. In this way, the show is not really about the youkai, it's about Natsume's friendship with these people and with his de facto adoptive family. 

All in all, this show is fairly standard as far as stories go. However, it gets some extra flavour from its non-romance shoujo nature, which means that there is more emphasis on bromance than romance, not to even mention the appearance of handsome older men who seduce Natsume. As creepy as this may sound at a glance, it's not that different from shows aimed at males(just with some gender reversals), it's mostly just hilarious. I recommend this show to basically everyone who likes slice of life and comedy. It's very non-offensive in most ways.

**Little Princess Sara 29-46 (Finished):** Top tier, in my eyes. There isn't much I can fault it for.

I have to commend the quality of the writing. I'm fairly sure absolutely nothing goes unresolved, and every single character, location, plot point, or story mentioned gets later used for something relatively important. All I can think of to describe the style is a russian doll, where layers are successively removed until there's nothing left. And then it gets built back up again, piece by piece. Some of the things that were mentioned earliest in the story came back right at the end (like selling matchsticks, for instance).

9/10 - cheesy ending brought it down a notch, but I was close to tears for most of the series. It has the [raisin game](http://a.pomf.se/ahnssq.webm), too.

**Ie Naki Ko 7-10:** Visually, still impressive. Compared to Sara though, it feels a lot more childish. Even though Remi and Sara start the same age (7), Sara is a lot more mature. Remi seems to be slowly growing each episode, but Sara peaked within the first cour or so.

I guess it'll be somewhat interesting to see where it goes, but I'm not hooked on it yet. 

**Jewelpet Happiness 2-18:** It actually feels like I'm watching Milky Holmes all over again. It's great, but so far nothing has beaten the sports day episode. [Megumi Han is perfect.](http://a.pomf.se/soymtq.webm)

I started watching the Monotagari series this past week. Before I began watching the show I had no idea what it was about. I thought it was a slice of life, light hearted type of show. I was wrong haha.

 The stories, different OP's and ED's, characters, animation, and writing had all my attention. I was entertained in every aspect and enjoyed what it offered. I have now just finished Nesimonotagri (famous toothbrush scene lololololol) and I am about to watch Nekomonotagari. I am really pumped for the new season coming up with Kanbaru!!! I highly recommend watching this show!!

So far 8.5/10

I completely agree. I loved the show up until the last few episodes where it felt like there wasn't enough material so the pacing slowed to hot tar on a slightly slanted sidewalk. Personally though, I did like the end, although, I've heard other opinions.

**Boku no Pico (69/3)**
>> ARTICLE
[**Aoi Bungaku**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7193) 6/12 - Quite interesting and psychedelic. Madhouse presentations and production values hold strong. This is essentially literature service, they're showing the feel of the books, not adapting them. So the material is just too cramped, making it abstract and hard to follow, there's just a certain disconnect  between the viewer and the story, so you need to interpret everything while watching and make assumptions. And without background details about Japan's state in the WW2 era, it's made even harder.

The characters are basic, and then were thrown into their psyche without us really knowing them, instead we need to pull out our own hardships and insert them into our viewing experience for it to be effective, I'm too young for this.

An incredibly well produced presentation on the literature pieces nonetheless. Just... read the books.
>> ARTICLE
After watching this I went to a local bookstore and had them order me the translated version of Osamu Dazai's 'No Longer Human'. It's been several years since I read it, but I ended up writing an essay on the book in my senior year. It was an amazing book.

Are you watching the [original Yozakura Quartet](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4548/Yozakura_Quartet) or the remake, [Hana no Uta?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18497/Yozakura_Quartet:_Hana_no_Uta)
>> ARTICLE
The original. I haven't even watched the OVA's yet. I just found out there was another season/series with the same characters and everything I can't wait to watch it.

Wait. It's a remake?? 
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend you watch the remake instead of the original Yozakura Quartet. They cover almost exactly the same material to a point, then I think the original does some "anime-only" adaptations. The the only major differences before then being the first few episodes of the original gives a little more backstory than the remake. The remake has far better animation, character designs, and pacing than the original.

Really? I really liked the first one a lot. It wasn't the best, but I liked it. I will definitely give it a watch though thanks.

Stens;Gate - Finished 

That show was just incredible, wow

Kokoro Connect - Still have the last 4 episodes (Michi Random) but really enjoyed it, I love character driven shows and thought all the characters were interesting

The Haruhi Movie - That is probably one of the best FILMS I've ever seen, not anime movies, just films. I would highly recommend watching the Haruhi Series, if not because its a great series, then just so you can watch the movie
>> ARTICLE
If you want my advice, don't watch Michi Random. Unless you like seething in rage after watching one of the most lovable characters turn into a complete bitch. I guess it depends on which girl you root for but both Inaba and Iori's characters take a whole 180 turn in personality.

The theme this week seemed to be monster of the week. 


**Digimon Tamers** (16-24/51)
Episodes 22 and 23 were great. And Impmon has this tragic tsundere thing going for him right now that makes him the best. I feel for him. They've had all these elements sitting around since the first couple of episodes, now it's time to put them together as they embark into the Digital World. Having characters go on a journey into the unknown is one of my favorite things in fiction. We're going to start a true adventure now. 


**Sailor Moon** (1-11/46)
Picking up a classic. I've only seen a couple episodes on Toonami back in the day, and I only remember that it was Sailor Moon, nothing else. I didn't hate the beginning episodes, but I would be lying if I said they're as enjoyable as the ones after introducing the other soldiers. Mercury's introduction episode is just so different from everything previous. Because she's going to be a lasting character, they actually took time to give her more than one personality trait. I could really feel myself dozing a bit in the early episodes. It was at [this moment](http://a.pomf.se/onjnaj.webm) (nothing too spoilery, just a moment of one character's face) when I knew that this show could get a whole lot better. [Spoiler probably](/s "She made a friend and was supposed to be enjoying first time playing a videogame, but when the game doesn't prove to be challenging, her smile fades. I don't know whether that means she's sad because she thinks her new friend won't like her for being better than her, or that she can't get satisfaction out of the ordinary and the mundane. I mean, she's a genius so maybe she's lost friends the same way in the past, or if the other point is what that expressions is getting at, then maybe being an ally of justice is the kind of life altering experience that will allow her to come into her full potential. OR maybe she was just in the zone. Who knows?") Anyway, it's a level of character depth that hasn't been shown for over half-a-dozen episodes on any character other than Moon. It really piqued my interest in the show. 


Then Mars comes onto the scene as a stricter, haughtier, and just as shallow version of Usagi. Her and Usagi have great banter. It's like two people who each can't accept the other's way of doing things even though they both have the same goal in mind. 


The show keeps getting better with each new soldier, so I'm really looking forward to when the whole cast is assembled. 


**Star Driver** (1-26/26)
I blew through this. I think this show might be in love with itself. It seems like half the things in the show are there just because someone wanted them to be there. Being fabulous for fabulous's sake. And it was great! All the characters were lively and interesting, and I'm a total sucker for any reason to show more mechs ([and did you see that ED animation daaaang](http://a.pomf.se/yacjqh.webm)), which were designed as fabulously and eccentrically as the characters and their personalities. Once I knew this show wasn't going to slow down and was going to continue to get more ridiculous is when I really started to enjoy it. It may have used the same footage over and over again every episode, but at least it was high budget. I love [this smirk](http://i.imgur.com/JHXAiOT.jpg), [so many smirks](http://i.imgur.com/cPrRvVX.jpg), and [this pose](http://i.imgur.com/xe87mdM.jpg), [so many poses](http://i.imgur.com/tSV3Eql.jpg)!

I finally crossed a milestone this past week, with my 300th completed MAL entry. 

**Mushishi**:

Ye gods, but could this anime have been more amazing... Set in such an amazingly detailed world, this was truly an anime to sit back and chill out to. In fact, I even took notes. No. Seriously. I'm going to use some of the things I saw in Mushishi to improve the background of my work in /r/worldbuilding. 

Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to fully appreciate it. I ran up against the end of the current season, and I had to rush through Mushishi a little bit too fast in order to get the series done s that it would legitimately be #300. As such, it lost a lot. This is truly not a show for marathoning. Like a fine sipping whisky, this is a show for sitting back and enjoying. And to treat it like a tray of Jello shots is a shame.

Score: **8.5/10**  
Recommendation level: *What the hell are you people waiting for?*  

**Pupipo!**  

Then again, there is something to be said about Jello shots: something fast, quick, easy, and does the job at hand. After Mushishi, I needed something like that, and so I settled on the Pupipo! shorts. 

It started off silly enough with a spooky girls that saw spooky things. But then it changed to this weird grand quest-style anime that made very little sense at all. It was still cute and sweet, but it just didn't make much sense at all.

Score: **7/10**  
Recommendation level: If you have a spare hour, there are worse ways to spend it.

**Nichijou** - 5/26


I've been threatening to watch this series for a while now thanks to all the hilarious gifs you guys have posted from it, and I've finally gotten around to watching it. I seriously think it's going to be in my top 10 favorite anime list by the end because I'm fucking loving it. The whole disconnected and free feel of the show makes it so unpredictable and fun, and I adore unpredictable and fun. I never know what's going to happen in each segment. So far I've seen massive explosions caused by a girl running into a boy, an android with a function for storing pastries, a girl annihilate a guy with various types of heavy artillery, a middle-aged high school principal suplex a deer, and a fucking epic hallway chase scene involving a yaoi doodle. It's always doing weird new shit, but not once has it come off as "lol im so randum :P." On top of that, the art style and animation is *so good*. It's weird and crazy, but it's really nice to look at. Everything's so smooth, clean, and bright. All in all, the enjoyability and hilariousness of Nichijou is just right through the roof. 
>> ARTICLE
I keep missing these topics so I'm going to post what I've watched the past few/several weeks..

**Planetes** - This anime is pretty incredible. It begins very simple and seems like it will be a lighthearted show about people in space. But slowly the plot builds on itself, introducing more serious themes that turns the show into something very unique. I absolutely loved it by the end.

**Madoka Magika** - Decided to try this since it was recommended to me. The soundtrack is magnificent, the art style is unique and it's nice to see something that's different to the usual magical girl story. However, it really isn't a show I could get into. I can see why it's successful though.

**Usagi Drop** - This anime is amazing. I have never seen a show that depicts a father/daughter relationship this well. It explores the difficulties of being a single father while showing how rewarding being a parent can be. But it does have it's dark moments which brings you back to the reality that life is hard. When it was over I was hoping to see more but then I read up on the manga and found out why. I wish I didn't find out about the manga ending haha.

**Anohana** - I heard that this anime was similar to Clannad/Angel Beats so I gave it a go. I wanted to enjoy this. The concept was great, but the execution wasn't. I couldn't stand Menma after a few episodes and the ending was very melodramatic. The characters would say why they would feel certain emotions, but there was no real portrayal to back it up. It left me feeling underwhelmed since I couldn't get into the characters.

Now I'm onto **Sakamichi No Apollon**. Yay for jazz.
>> ARTICLE
I keep on trying to watch Planetes but every time I start it I lose interest due to the slow pace and forget about it.  I've got a week before the Summer season kicks up so maybe I'll try it again. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I actually felt like dropping it after episode 3, but I decided to keep going and things slowly improve. I'd say if you're upto episode 10 and you're not enjoying it, then you probably won't want to finish. But it turns from a slow paced lighthearted show into a kind of political/sci fi thriller with some drama thrown in.

[Cipher](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11867/Cipher)
As the name implies, Cipher is like a cipher, written in a way which only the smartest of the smartest would be able to decipher. 
Set in the 1980s, Cipher gives us the deepest insight into life that we could ever imagine, in the form of Siva and his twin brother Jay, who shares a bromance while dating a high school girl at the same time. The deliberate misspelling on the cake commercial and the 8.5 minute op of repeated scenes only added to the overall deep message that's conveyed in this film.
I strongly urge anyone and everyone to watch this masterpiece known as Cipher.
Final rating masterpiece / mars of destruction.

**Psycho-Pass (2/22)** (Watched 1-2 this week)

Okay, I only saw two episodes of this because my brother wants me to wait so we can watch it all together (me, him, his gf and his friend). That being said, the first episode was awesome. The entire episode might as well been a chase scene. I liked how the girl (really bad with character names, bear with me) defended the girlfriend of the guy that was killed, and ultimately saved her life, even though it meant temporarily paralyzing one of her allies. This was really good for the first episode, first episodes usually bore the hell out of me.

**Mushi-shi (4/26)** (Watched 2-4 this week)

This is more interesting than I thought it would be to be honest. I watched about half of the first episode a few months ago and I didn't really think it was anything special, but now I see that this is more laid back compared to other shows. It's a really good anime for chilling out. I like it. 

**Kimi ni Todoke S1 (25/25)** (Watched S1 19-25 this week)

I kinda thought the ending wasn't that great for this. If you read what I said about this last week, I was really into it (and talking about losing masculinity) but the ending kinda put me off, I was expecting them to at least start dating before the end of this season. But now I only have 15 episodes left and that means it's cutting it close in an anime like this. 

**Monster (40/74)** (Watched 36-40 this week)

Over halfway there! I don't really have much to say about this that isn't a huge spoiler for the series other than that this is amazing so far. This will be my new longest anime I've finished when I actually finish it, so maybe it's the fact that I know Tenma's thoughts without him saying a word, and that pretty much everything is coming together that makes me feel this way about it. But my feelings on it stand, amazing.

**Henneko (4/12)** (Watched 1-4 this week)

I saw this on my Crunchyroll queue and figured why not. I've always kinda admired the art style from afar, and so far not bad. It's not fantastic or anything but it's worth watching... so far. 

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (13/27)** (Watched 13 this week)

I like the way things are going here. I just need to watch more. Fuck.

**Redline (Movie)**

I didn't really like this other than the insanely awesome animation. I thought the story was okay, pretty clichd. I don't really see why they fell in love with each other, but that was pretty obviously going to happen ever since the beginning of the movie with them at dinner. It was fun. I give it a **6/10.** The dedicated animators should team up with a better writer and then they could make the best movie of all time.

**The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Movie)**

This was... interesting, to say the least. I liked the story and characters. The time travel thing was a bit confusing at first but it started making sense really fast. I liked the twist that [TGWLTT spoilers](/s " Chiaki not only came from the future, but he was the one that accidentally gave Makoto the same power.")It was a fun watch. I give it an **8.5/10.**

**Ghost in the Shell (Movie)**

This was very interesting. There was lots of boobs in the beginning, and I almost shut it off for a while, but then I decided fuck it and continued watching. I enjoyed it. It was interesting how they [GitS spoilers](/s "made the criminal something/someone totally digital. Must have been a total mindfuck when it came out, considering the movie is from 1995. It was pretty mind-fucky even today.") I give this a **8.75/10.**

**Paprika (Movie)**

Holy shit this was great. I loved this movie. I... don't even know what to say. Ummm.... [Paprika spoilers](/s "The way the dreams collided with each other and mashed together, only to eventually become reality really was crazy. I don't think this can get topped easily in it's genre.") Very unique and awesome music. Art style was great too. Jesus, pretty much perfect. **10/10**

**Garden of Words (Movie)** 

Just finished it and wow, the animation is pretty. It was kind of a touching love story, but I can see how their would be controversy with the teacher-student relationship. I'm glad she finally got her shoes at the end of the movie, but I have to say most of it was pretty predictable. It was still nice. It's mostly eye-candy though. **7/10.**

>> ARTICLE
I missed all of the shows I've been covering for the last few weeks due to watching [Summer Games Done Quick](http://gamesdonequick.com/), but I did rush through one other series because a friend got into the fandom.

**Attack on Titan** (25/25) - Quality animation and soundtrack, but the pacing is absolutely horrendous. It's very slow, but instead of using the time to develop secondary characters or the plot they just repeat information that's already been floating around. The fights are decent, but are drawn out far too long for my liking.

[Attack on Titan](/s "When Eren was saying the names of the rest of Levi's squad members as he watched them die, I spent far too long trying to recall which one of the otherwise indistinguishable soldiers he was talking about. It's only been a few days and the only one of them I can even remember the name of is Petra. The many deaths have almost no emotional impact and watching the characters I do recognize grieve over them becomes tedious as a result.")
>> ARTICLE
That's why I think it's stupid when people make comparisons of Attack on Titan with Game of Thrones, they're not even in the same league. This is coming from someone who loved AoT.

The weight of the character deaths in Game of Thrones is just so much heavier. These are characters that have been with us for entire *seasons* and have had much more characterization. AoT on the other hand has a character for maybe a couple of episodes with no real development. A quirk or two and some dialogue maybe, but that is about it.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I'm watching AoT right now (just finished ep 22) and for the past few episodes the only thing I could think was "wow, this is more brutal GoT". They're very comparable and it makes sense that they would be compared because they both have giant casts of characters are there are no clear "safe" options.

I guess the biggest difference is (as you noted) that in GoT is more about who will die and how that's a mystery... Sort of a slow unravelling of multiple plot threads... But AoT is a thousand times more brutal IMO, every glimpse of hope has been immediately dashed, sometimes episodes worth of character development and hype are dashed in SECONDS.

>episodes worth of character development

Did I miss another season or something? The main difference to me is that I honestly *don't care* who dies in Attack on Titan because I barely know them. Sure, it's another crapsack world where the existence of humanity's threatened but I'm almost rooting for the titans to just get it over with.

You know what would make it closer to Game of Thrones? [Attack on Titan](/s "If Eren actually *died* when the titan swallowed him.")

>Did I miss another season or something? 

Maybe you weren't paying attention to the one that does exist? Or maybe, for whatever reason, what touched me doesn't effect you the same way? Or maybe something else?

I only know that where you "honestly don't care" who dies, I was HEAVILY involved in EVERYONE's fate. All of the 104th graduating class, and then everyone on Captain Levi's Sqaud in Scouting Regiment.
>> ARTICLE
No I don't think it's even comparable.

> makes sense that they would be compared because they both have giant casts of characters

The amount of on screen time, dialogue, and characterization is not even comparable to the people in AoT. They both have giant casts but the main difference is that there is not main character in Game of Thrones whereas in Attack on Titan there very clearly *is*. 
>> ARTICLE
I heard a few comparisons before starting (I love Game of Thrones so was hoping it was apt) but all of the characters are really shallow to me. Even lesser ones in ASOIAF like Janos Slynt and Beric Dondarrion feel like more interesting characters than Eren and Mikasa, but that might partially be due to being a book reader.

[Attack on Titan](/s "Lol exactly, the one time I felt a shounen power-up was when  Eren got eaten and turned into a Titan.")

I have been on a comedy spree. Rewatched Seitokai Yakaindomo and Boku Wa Tomodachi Ga Sukunai.  Watched Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and going to watch Seitokai Yakaindomo 2. (Sorry for not typing Seitokai Yakaindomo right, wrote this in a car with a bad internet and Can't look up what is the correct way to type it.

**Love Live S1** 13/13  
**Love Live OVA**

After seeing those ridiculous sales numbers earlier this week for Love Live, I finally decided to check it out. Definitely was not disappointed. I probably would have appreciated it more if I watched it before the knowledge of a second season. Some of the drama near the end would be been stronger.  Currently catching up on S2 for the finale tomorrow. 
^Honoka ^best ^girl, ^right?  
OVA was... different.

I watched all of [Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22123/Inugami-san_to_Nekoyama-san) this weekend, it was really upbeat and enjoyable, normally not my kind of thing but I liked it. It's short at twelve 3 minute episodes and worth checking out for anyone with a few minutes to spare.     

And I rewatched Mobile Suit Gundam 00 the Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer, and [Sword Art Online: EXTRA EDITION](http://www.crunchyroll.com/sword-art-online/sword-art-online-extra-edition-movie-648529) to recap on the SAO plotline.

I watched the first few episodes of Nana; looks promising, despite the fact that the more girlish Nana is a little bit annoying momentarily. But I guess that will change when they have finished summarizing her past.

I started watching [Higurashi no Naku Koro ni](http://myanimelist.net/anime/934/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni) yesterday, and I binge watched all the [Elfen Lied](http://myanimelist.net/anime/226/Elfen_Lied) episodes in an afternoon the day before that, and watch all of [Black Rock Shooter](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11285/Black%E2%98%85Rock_Shooter_(TV)) in an afternoon the day before that (I've had some lazy nights).

Elfen Lied was pretty good, honestly wasn't expecting so much nudity and violence (not that I'm complaining whatsoever), story was good, I was more confused than sad at the ending, guess I need to read the books to understand the other parts of the story. 

Black Rock Shooter was confusing at first but I got it like half way (AKA when they spoonfed the explanation of what was happening), it was also pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
**Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya** 3/10 - Still not too sure about this but I'll finish it though it's lower on my priority list than the other two.

**Hataraku Maou-Sama** 11/13 - Damn good! A lot better than I was expecting. Gonna finish this as soon as I can I think.

**Ookiku Furikabutte** 5/25 - Started on this today and I'm loving it, Baseball series are generally really good and this is no exception!

I dropped Non Non Biyori after 7 episodes for some unknown reason so I've started it again and I'm currently 5/12

Watched Genocyber. Kind of interesting. Fun, early 90s sci-fi/cyberpunk styled show. It felt like a nice break from a lot of the stuff that seems to air currently (not that it's bad).

bakemonogatari I like fucked up stuff That show is amaaaazing!

I watched Bakemonogatari. I fell in love with it and its characters!

I've completed both seasons of Yuru Yuri this past week. It was a pretty enjoyable series.

I watched episodes 11 and 12 of Space Dandy. Episodes 12 was the better of the two. The series has been fairly enjoyable for me.

Checked out the first episode of Tamako Market. Found it a little boring, but Mochizou was cute. I don't think I can watch it for him though.


Watched both seasons of Senyuu and totally loved them. It was a nice short.

Watched [Project A-ko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJffLvfNSnc) a couple days ago. Dang what a silly movie. The dub was especially goofy and horrible, but that gave it some charm. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to watch an older anime comedy and has 90 minutes to kill. 
>> ARTICLE
I went on a Studio Ghibli movie watching streak this week, and i've seen The Wind Rises, Princess Mononoke, The Cat Returns, Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, Kiki's Delivery Service, and finished Porco Rosso last night. All of them were spectacular films, especially since Spirited Away gave me a lot of nostalgia to when I was 3 and it's still my favorite(with Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso as of now), and I finally learned that Totoro was prononced Toe-to-ro not To-tor-ro. Next on my list is Nausicaa, since I heard somewhere that it was *the* film that made Studio Ghibli famous, unless i'm wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Monogatari: Second Season** (ep19-end)  
First few arcs were a bit weaker than the last 2 but overall really enjoyable. Overall on par with Bake I would say.

Started just recently **Psycho-Pass** (ep1+2)  
Looks really promising. I kind of like the setting and I can see in what kind of direction this can go.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Psycho-Pass, so the feels are still real... You are in for a treat! Is Monogatari worth starting? I've heard good things, and know where to begin, but I'm still weighing up what I'm going to binge watch while I wait for season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is really good. But be aware that it has some fanservice (sometimes more, sometimes less) and is very dialogue heavy with many wordplays. That said it is very "special" when it comes to artstyle and other things.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching **Kokoro Connect** this week because Sawashiro Miyuki is in it (literally), and man am I glad I decided to watch it for such a trivial reason. About half way through the show and I can honestly say that it feels like this show has gotten more shit done/characters have progressed and grown up more than some shows do before the entire series ends. Loving every minute of it.

**Planetes** is the next show I'm going to finish, probably tommorow (3 episodes left). Came back to it after forgetting about it for a while, but with all the shows ending this week, I thought I should finish this up, too. The drama is intensifying on and around the moon; interested to see how this all wraps up. Real nice to see a show about space that doesn't have giant robots and laser beams.

Bakemonogatari.  I'm stuck on the Monkey's paw arc.  I've been trying to get through this for like a month, but i just can't finish the arc, I'm just bored out of my mind.  Maybe i'll try it again in a few months.

Madouka Magica.  I'm 3 episodes in.  I like this a lot.  I was hoping it wouldn't be too much senseless action, and so far the plot has been pretty enjoyable.

I finished panty and stocking with garterbelt, watched some gintama and soul eater and nichijou, and started one piece

Oh and I watched the most recent episodes of Fairy Tail, Black Bullet and NGNL. A shame Black Bullet is almost done and NGNL is finished (at least for now, hopefully)
>> ARTICLE
Black Bullet came out of nowhere for me. I picked up the first 2 episodes, and didn't think much of it. Then a couple of weeks ago I decided to binge watch it out of having nothing better to do, and, wow. The feels are real. You know what I mean (The bomb episode).

Seriously man, went from endearing to messed up in no time at all

I watched "king of thorn"
Meh, I give it 7/10, most of it is just kinda typical horror stuff, but the end pulls a mind fuck inception style, interesting concept as well.

Just got done watching Clannad. It was a cute story but kinda lost me at the ending 
>> ARTICLE
Watched:

**Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuiokuhen** ep. 3-4 *(out of 4)*

**Tokyo Magnitude 8.0** ep. 5-11 *(out of 11)*

**Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin** ep. 1-6 *(out of 26)*

**Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou** ep. 6-12 + specials *(out of 12, and all 6 specials)*

**Fate/Zero** ep. 1-6 *(out of 13)*

**Kemonozume** ep. 1-2 *(out of 13)*

Kenshin OVA was nice (8/10), Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 was sad (7/10), Nichibros had some funny moments (6/10).

Rainbow and Fate/Zero are pretty nice, 7/10's at the moment, kind of disappointed with F/Z so far because of all the hype, Rider is awesome though, and it's still not *bad*. I like Gen's stuff, but I don't love it I guess.

Kemonozume seems to be a good Yuasa-fix now that Ping Pong is over, reminds me a little of the manga Parasyte, which I'm reading at the moment. On a non-anime side-note, I also watched the **Adventure Time** episode that Yuasa directed, it was pretty fun and trippy.
>> ARTICLE
Binged through Bubblegum Crisis and Crash (for the umpteenth time) after Mad Machine came up in a playlist shuffle. Bubblegum Crisis has one of my all time favorite soundtracks, and the show itself (while it is showing it's age a bit) is great. Still (im)patiently waiting for the bluray set of Crisis.
>> ARTICLE
I guess this kinda an airing show, but I just marathoned Ping Pong the animation. I liked how it's "realistic" in terms of talent and what it takes to make it in the sports world.

**Capeta [60/60]**: Been going on a sports anime marathon recently and Capeta is definitely one of the more interesting ones. Really disappointed in how it ended personally, [MM! Ep. 10](/s "since we didn't get to see him and Minamoto actually race each other."). I personally found the characters rather flat and stale because the anime didn't really delve into the characters.

**Oreshura [13/13]**: Ridiculous humour, Jojo references, really cute girls and [](/s "a really well done harem ending").What's there not to like? **TEAM SILVER RANGER!** 

**Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga [10/10]**: I really like anime where they don't stick to the tried and tested formula for romcoms and this was really funny and outfield. The non-conclusive ending wasn't to my ending though.

**Sakura Trick** *completed*

Made me feel a little uncomfortable watching it at first but once I realised it was really quite a sweet story I quickly got over the feeling of awkwardness. Really enjoyed it overall. Kaede is so awesome :D

**Kiss X Sis (TV and OVA)** *Completed*

HOLY SHIT. That's the most extreme Ecchi I've ever seen. I really enjoyed it, and i can't wait or the next episode of the OVA but DAMN. Who makes this stuff?!

**Shingeki No Kyojin** *Rewatch: Completed*

Really enjoyed rewatching this after watching it for the first time in December. The transformation sequences are amazing combined with an awesome soundtrack. I hope to hear more about S2 soon.

**School Days** *Completed*

Genuinely decided to watch this because it was advertised on MAL as a High School Romance and I wanted something light-hearted to watch while I went to bed before coming to work on Monday.

Turned out to be a very different beast that, no matter how much I hated it, couldn't be put down. Ended up finishing the series at 4AM this morning,

Probably simultaneously one of my most hated and one of my favourite anime of all time.

Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita 8/12 - so random

Kyoukai no Kanata 2/12 - Looks good so far
>> ARTICLE
It's only around the halfway point I started to really enjoy Jinrui, I'd love to see another season some time it could be very funny when it shifted into being more satirical.
>> ARTICLE
Me too. 

It picked up a lot after the whole "Oyagi" arc with the robots. Was one of the first times where I felt that the series was actually very touching. Then it only picked up from there as they dealt more with origin stories. I really liked the banana arc with the assistant, her first job as a mediator and the last couple of episodes which dealt with her beginnings.

The first 4 episodes or so are still very solid IMO but compared to the rest it can be sort of lackluster.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its just such a shame that when she got some proper character development it ended.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first two Golden Boy OVAs.

There is a huge amount of Ecchi fan service stuff in this show, which in most cases, bugs me to the point I can't enjoy the show. I gave up on Kill La Kill for that reason. But being that it's a comedy and it makes sense within the context of the show, it hasn't bugged me at all. 

With that out of the way... This show is HILARIOUS, and the animation gags are fantastic. Loving it so far.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I'm the same as you in that regard. I normally can't stand ecchi stuff, but Golden Boy had me in tears at a few different points. STUDY STUDY STUDY STUDY!

Hunter x Hunter (2011). Just finished the first arc (the exam) and I have to admit that all my doubts and fears concerning this anime have faded out. I'm soo loving it. It's getting more serious and mature.

I'd like to see what you have to say about each arc. The show will start to get good around the fourth arc (the second 2 are pretty short).
>> ARTICLE
Me too, im up to episode 72 and it's going from strength to strength.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching through this series (up to the third arc) and I love the blend between comedy and the more serious elements. It also helps that there are plenty of episodes to go before I'll be done with it!

I just finished the Zodiac arc and the second movie myself. I wish there was more, but maybe in a few years.....maybe.

It's worth mentioning that the exam arc is probably and imo the weakest of the arcs. Hope you check into this thread every week to share your progress. Its always great seeing first time hxh reactions.

It's better than the forgettable second arc.
>> ARTICLE
Zoldyck or heavens areana? Because I don't even count the zoldyck family story as it own arc. Heavens areana however I thought was pretty decent and was when I started to properly enjoy the show. Plus it has one of my favourite fights of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Are you talking about [Hunter X Hunter 2011 Spoilers](/s "the shwing fight")?

Ahaha what else but that? I knew it would be a good fight as soon as it started off with a schwing. 

(Btw no need for the spoiler tag, hardly spoils anything but props to you for being cautious anyway)

I felt the same way when I watched the first arc for the first time.  It gets better and better with every episode.   If you enjoyed the first arc you're going to **love** later arcs.  
>> ARTICLE
I finished White Album 2 and it's quickly become one of my favorite shows ever. So many tears
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who didn't like that show? [White Album 2](/s "Even after the emotional moment at the airport, Touma leaves anyway? And just when I thought Setsuna had realized her mistake and was ready to move on, she just hopelessly clings to Kitahara.") I did really like [this song](http://youtu.be/IJRWaGxB8iw) though.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked it but couldn't love it due to lack of closure and explanation. 

[WA2](/s "I really liked how Setsuna admitted all her mistakes, that's something I haven't seen a character do in pretty long time. But at the same time, she still loves him and he still loves her? But less then how much he loves Touma. Sooo, now what? Did they stay together (with Setsuna)? Or does he have long-distance relationship with Touma? I can't really imagine how would either work after all that happened.")

Anyway, I also watch it just now. Really enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone. Worth it for the soundtrack at least.
>> ARTICLE
The show only adapted a third of the visual novel
>> ARTICLE
Any idea if the rest is going to be animated?

Nope

I like you.

but yeah WA2 is sooo good.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (6-12/12) + Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren (12/12)** - Finished Season 1 and watched the entirety of Season 2 of Chu2koi this week and...just, wow. I am so impressed after finishing this series. It's been a number of months since an anime has hit my feels like Chuunibyou. I enjoyed it so much that it's moved up to being considered my second favorite anime of all time, and it's taken over my life.

**EDIT: Rikka best girl**

**Fate/stay Night(2006) (1-3/24)** - Decided on a whim to check out the Studio DEEN adaptation of F/SN, since I picked it up cheap on DVD from RightStuf in all their sales. So far, it's...good, not great. I dislike Emiya's character, but I can understand his motives. The rest are meh, Tosaka's okay, Archer's okay. I like the short glimpse I've gotten of Saber.
>> ARTICLE
Just curious what you thought of S2 of Chuuni. It gets a lot of hate for being weaker than the first season, but I find some shows are better if you watch them in a short time frame instead of weekly. I'm in the category of disliking it...well I gave it a 5/10 while I gave the first season 9/10. With such a huge gap in enjoyment I'm just overall curious on the thoughts of someone who saw S2 in one go.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I loved Season 2. I didn't really like Satone's character early on and I felt like she was kinda shoehorned in, because dur-hur-hur love triangle...but, as the season went on, I think they did a good job building up her past with Togashi, to the point where I actually felt for her during the rain scene in Episode...10, I think (the "surprise attack"). Overall, I was very satisfied with Season 2, as a continuation from Season 1 (I especially liked the little instances of Nibutani's chunibyo poking out).
>> ARTICLE
As someone said in another thread about Emiya: F/SN Emiya is a fuckboy, whereas the UBW is a lot less of a retard and has some balls at times.

**Toaru Kagaku no Railgun (24/24)** - Pretty good, I liked the overarching plot line they had, with everything coming together in the end, even if it was a bit disjointed. Much better than Index. 8/10

**Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S (12/24)** - Now this is good. Better animation and plot compared to the first episode. Really enjoying it. Good to see Touma make more appearances so we can see tsundere biribiri :D
>> ARTICLE
how am i supposed to start the raildex series
>> ARTICLE
Index is the main story, railgun is a side story focusing on the girls and academy city - you can watch it like index - railgun - index 2 - railgun s.

The general consensus here is to watch railgun - railgun s - index - index 2, or just skip index altogether.

Questions like these have answers on the FAQ, for future reference.
>> ARTICLE
thank you, i appreciate it- i will read the FAQ next time

but on a personal note, how did/are you watching them? and what is your opinion on skipping the index arc?
>> ARTICLE
Index has a bigger story and good pacing but I don't find the magic side all that interesting.  It does feature some science arcs though and adorable tsundere mikoto.  

As far as continuity goes, railgun is before railgun s, index is before index ii, and the first 17 episodes of railgun S takes place in episodes 10-14 of index first season.  That's it.
>> ARTICLE
I watched maybe 8 episodes of Index, and dropped it as it was really boring. Just went straight into railgun then railgun s, and it's been great.
>> ARTICLE
There are science only arcs in index that are pretty good.  Those revolve around mikoto and accelerator.  I didn't care for most of the magic arcs though the movie was decent.
>> ARTICLE
**Kill la Kill (24/24)**

Honestly, I went into this thinking it wasn't going to be great, I figured it was one of those shows that gets really popular and everyone thinks it's god-tier when it's not really. Boy was I wrong.

This show is crafted absolutely amazingly, it knows exactly what it is the entire way through, with every dramatic moment there is an equal ridiculous comedy moment to balance it out and keep the show's identity and that's what I think made it truly unique.

I'd definitely recommend this show to anyway that isn't turned off by ecchi, 8/10.
>> ARTICLE
**Monster 46-57**

Last week I said I was probably going to finish Monster. Then I got sick. I've been sick for over a week now and just this Friday I got an ear infection on top of it. So now I can't hear very well out of my left ear which makes using headphones difficult, and that's how I usually watch anime. Life sucks.

Monster itself got really interesting with a slightly unexpected twist during episode 50. 51 was a good follow up to it too. I really want to see the ending but I'm still in a very blah state of mind.
>> ARTICLE
Naruto, completed the entirety of part 1, skipped the filler of course. As much hate as it gets, it's not that bad. Not the greatest Shonen by far, and it tends to drag at times, but I am enjoying it. I'm also through episode 45 of Shippuden, and it didn't start as fast as I wanted it to. Still interesting though, but I'm hoping for more. 
>> ARTICLE
**[Manyuu Hikenchou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10465/Manyuu_Hikenchou) (6/12) (uncensored)**

My God. Oh my God.

Let me start with telling you the premise of the series.  
The world is 'ruled' by breasts. If a woman has big breasts, she is assured wealth and opportunity. If a woman is flat, she is a failure of a human.  
Now, the female MC is from a clan specialized in nurturing breasts and slicing the breasts off of other women without killing them. The MC has a special power, which is fucking *stealing the volume of another woman's breasts*.

This anime can often come *so damn close* to being a hentai. This series is weird but extremely fappable. It's also nuts how good the visuals are for such a stupid extreme ecchi show. The plot is extremely thin and almost non-existend though, but that's not the focus of this show.

Funnily enough, this anime stereotypes men and make them look stupid and simple-minded (with *all of them* wanting nothing more than breasts) while the MC is a strong female lead.

I actually expected nothing less of the studio that made [Seikon no Qwaser](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6500/Seikon_no_Qwaser), an anime where the MC gains powers by *sucking breasts*.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking of Seikon no Qwaser while reading that description...came to the last sentence of your post, and said "OF COURSE" out loud.

* [**The iDOLM@STER**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10278/The_iDOLM@STER) - **Complete** - I finally finished this series this week. I had it on hold since I wasn't a fan of the antagonist. I'd say this series really needed some better writing. The girls are a lot of fun and there's a good amount of development. The series just suffers from Poorly Written Antagonist Syndrome. Other series that suffer from this at one point would be SAO and Accel World. I probably wished cruel and painful death upon the antagonist of this series over 30 times during the course of 9 episodes. You can ask /u/Overlord3k, but I've been ranting at him about how the real world works and stuff with how unrealistic a lot of shit that happened was. Moving on though before I start my rant, this series was certainly interesting. I think I would've liked to see a lot more slice of life kind of things. My favorite episode was probably that Sunday show they were doing. I'd like to see more episodes like that. I don't know if I'll watch more of the the spin-offs and sequels. It really depends honestly. Can anyone let me know if the story is still poorly written badly in a couple aspects or is it improved to where I'm not raging while watching the episode. Also, let me know which of the side/spin-offs/sequels I should watch to be able to enjoy them.
* [**Toradora**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!) - **Re-Watching** - I've been keeping up with the tradition. The only thing is that I'm not really doing it one day at a time. Someone I know ended up tagging along despite their little experience in anime. (They've only ever seen Steins;Gate and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica before and both with me.) I really wasn't expecting it, but he's actually enjoying this series. It's so hard to get a grasp on his taste in series. Back on topic though, he's been watching this series with me and he keeps wanting to marathon it further and further. At this point, we're watching 6 episodes over the course of a 2 days and I'm holding off on watching during the week. I still want to watch the Christmas Eve episode on Chirstmas Eve so I'll be stubborn about that.
* [**Fate/Zero**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate/Zero) - **Re-Watching** - Currently showing this series to the same person mentioned before. When we're not marathoning Toradora, we're watching this series. Almost at the end, then I'll start showing him Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works. 
* [**Mawaru Penguindrum**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum) - **Watching** - I started this 2 weeks ago but I failed to talk about it. I'm only 7 episodes in so far. It's interesting to say the least. I don't know if I'll like this series in the long run but I do plan on completing it. The Survival Strategy times are fun with the transformations and the gags. I like the Penguins since they always seem to be entertaining.

I totally agree. When I got my friend into anime, he liked AoT. I assumed that he was a fan of darker action and/or thriller series. He later told me that he loved Angel Beats and asked if he would enjoy Bakemonogatari or Clannad. I told him that I didn't think he'd like Clannad and that Bake would not be good enough for a newcomer. He ended up liking Clannad and Bake is his favorite anime. Fuck reccomendations. I've learned to just let people try what they want.

Also, I'm about the same progress on MaPen as you. (Trying not to mention that I've barely made 3 episodes progress in 5~6 months.) I'm not really a huge fan and i have no idea where it's trying to go. I've heard that it gets better soon though but I'm not too optimistic. I love the main two characters and Himari. Not a huge fan of that other girl (Ringo?), Tabuki, or the actress lady. I have a shitload of stuff to get to after this though (if I ever make it through). I've been on a rampage recently (dropping GiT and 22 other series this season). 
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's a bit hard to tell you if it's worth watching a movie, since I don't really understand what one means with poor writing, but if you didn't like the 'antagonist aspect' and liked insert songs, concerts and drama then you could watch the movie. I think it has all the good bits in it from the show.
>> ARTICLE
I am currently watch Steins;Gate and I must say, I am not really seeing why it is hyped up. I am currently on episode 11, and I have read around that on episode 12 it starts to pick up, but overall, I see the potential for plot twists, with all the mysteries behind each character, however I doubt I will end up giving the anime a 10/10 or even a 9/10 because it is almost like I am forcing myself to get through the first 11 episodes. Im hoping episode 12-24 are worth it though!
>> ARTICLE
personally I feel that no matter how amazing the latter half of a show is, it cannot compensate for the 11 first episodes that I literally had to force myself to watch because of how bored I was. so yes, it undoubtedly gets better, but not to the extent that I would rate it anywhere close to a 10. I can attest that hype ruined this show for me and drastically inflated my expectations. 
>> ARTICLE
Any sort of hype tends to ruin an anime for me.

The first half of Steins;gate was a bit slow, and I enjoyed trying to figure out what was building up. Then it got *goood*.
>> ARTICLE
This is my thoughts on Clannad and After story I think After story is amazing but clan ad was a little eh for me so when my friends tell me its the best anime ever I don't necessarily agree
>> ARTICLE
Please report back after you get to the turning point. 

Also, I guess I'm weird as I liked the whole series. The first half gives you all the clues you will need in the second. Without it, the show would not be nearly as well regarded.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished episode 16. Pretty amazing since episode 12, told myself I'd watch one episode a day but I just ended up watching 12-16 non stop haha. I do think it is getting pretty amazing, but I still do stand by my thoughts on the first 11 episodes. I agree that they were needed to get to know the characters/the rules of time travel in the world they live in and what not, but that did not make it any easier to watch the first time around. Overall, if the hype im watching keeps up, I will probably end up giving it a 9/10 because it has kept me on my feet in a way I havent felt since my first watch of Death Note. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished this 20 minutes ago. Keep going i think the second half of the shows, MC gets some character development.

**Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season (12/12)**  
  
I loved this show, it's something I hope continues what I like to call the K-On! effect, where the first season is great, but the second season manages to improve on it and finally the movie is the best part.  
  
Everything was improved in the second season, the emotions ran high and the 3D dance sequences seemed to look a lot better. At first I was a little worried about the music, it didn't click with me as much as the first season with songs like Start:Dash!!, but then one of the final songs really made up for it. Snow Halation became one of my favourite songs from the series. Overall a really good season, can't wait for the movie.  
  
**Rating: 9/10**

Finished **Ping Pong** in one sitting.

Very solid show with a heavy focus on character development rather than the sport. In this show ,despite it being out of the sports genre, the actual focus is not the sport or the matches but the characters and their journey in life. Great show if you can get accustomed to the visual style. 9/10

>> ARTICLE
**No** **game** **No** **life**. Watched this thinking it was going to be somewhat like SAO, but I ended watching something way different. I really enjoyed this anime and the way Sora's strategies kind of reminded me of Lelouch from Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
Finals are over! The gods of the curve have blessed me with a bountiful grade harvest, and so although I've barely applied to any places for internships, I am confident my first semester GPA as a transfer from community college will not be an impediment as I start applications now. 

With that said, I've only had a few days. I've been giving *UN-GO* (7/11) a whirl, partially because I wanted to listen to some more of Kensuke Ushio's (*Ping Pong the Animation*, *Space Dandy, No. 6*) music. [The ED is fantastic, and the aesthetic reminds me of *Durarara. I highly recommend you listen.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWRjJRrfclY)

The plot itself, however...leaves a little more to be desired. It's single episode mysteries often feel like summaries and very dry ones at that, not allowing the mystery to "breate" and allow the atmosphere and actors to stick with the viewer (with the exception of the two-part mystery, which was well-done.) Clearly the show is trying to say *something*, given it's emphasis on *truth* and the hovering background of a recently ended war and the authoritarian reaction to terrorism causing information restrictions (maybe some sort of jab at post 9-11 America?) However, it comes across as a muddled, to the point that while others have said the show has a large overarching theme, I can't pin-point what that is yet. Those who have seen it, what did you think? 

P.S. At the moment, I've got *Fuujin Monogatari, Legend of the Millenium Dragon, Ghost Hound,* and the second *Kara no Kyoukai* movie. What should I watch? I can also go for *Cowboy Bebop*, although I wonder if I should save that for a special occasion. And I *have* been meaning to try *Katanagatari* and get back into *Monogatari S2*.
>> ARTICLE
Go for Kara no Kyoukai. You have already started the series, may as well aim to finish it!
>> ARTICLE
I finished Madoka a few days ago, and it instantly became one of my favorites :)
>> ARTICLE
I'll do some random stuff first before I hit the big part of the article. That way, you guys will read *something* before you start to get bored with my old-man babble.  

**Canvas: Sepia-iro no Motif**  

Amazingly enough, it was exceptionally forgettable. And, for some reason, I'm very very glad I've already thrown away all of these memories.  

Score: 3/10  
Recommendation level: Avoidance.  

**ef: A Tale Of Memories - Recollections**  

It was an hour-long recap of some of the less significant parts of ef: A Tale Of Memories, interspersed with little commentary moments by Chihiro and a suddenly crossplaying Renji. Only a couple of the more significant spoilers are in this, but they're all presented in a way that actually cheapens the season as a whole.  

Score: 6/10  
Recommendation level: Even if you've seen the ef: series, there's no reason to watch this. And if you haven't, there's even less reason.  

**Tenshi no Tamago**

It... was... interesting, I suppose. Angel's Egg was a strange movie with long spans of time without any spoken words whatsoever. It was just long pan after long pan of weird scenery and strange events, some of which were never really explained. 

That will probably make a lot of people pan on Angel's Egg. But the artwork is the real story. Many viewers will be reminded of Vampire Hunter D and its very gothic feel. It shouldn't be surprising to note that Angel's Egg was released the day after the first showing of Vampire Hunter D. 

Score: 6/10  
Recommendation level: Art film night.  

**Little Witch Academia**  

There isn't a lot of analysis you can do to a title that is only 22 minutes long plus credits. It was meant to be just a little cute story about a normal girl that goes to a school for witches. But the thing is...

It worked. It *was* a cute little story, and it packed an exceptional amount of worldbuilding and plot details and character development into such a short running time. It's no wonder that this was one of the most exceptional pieces to come out of Anime Mirai 2012... and I'm already ready for the sequel coming out later this year.

Score: 9/10  
Recommendation level: If you have a spare half-hour one day, watch it. You won't be disappointed.  

**Death Billiards**

Speaking of Anime Mirai 2012 and upcoming sequels, Death Billiards is definitely the crown jewel. No spoilers. No lead-in. No nothing. Just go and watch it. Immediately. And then put Death Parade in your queue for the Winter 2015 season.

Score: 9/10  
Recommendation level: STOP READING AND WATCH THIS! For fuck's sake, dude, it's text. Come back to this later. I promise that this comment isn't going anywhere.  

**Piano no Mori**  

I was leafing through the recommendations page of MAL Graph, just to see if anything interesting had popped up rather than the standard action shounen titles that have been plaguing it for a long time. And, amazingly enough, something new did pop up. And, even more amazingly, I watched it.  

Piano no Mori is a beautiful movie about a boy, a sudden friend, and an abandoned piano left out in the woods. From the backgrounds to the music, it is a treat for the eyes and the ears alike. It does have some problems, particularly with the characters, plus some really friggin' *weird* detours that made absolutely zero sense. And those problem did heavily impact my enjoyment of the movie as a whole.  

It isn't entirely unworthy, however. Music anime of all kinds are welcomed by their fans, and Piano no Mori is no exception.  

Score: 7/10  
Recommendation level: If you're watching Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, you should have this on your PTW List.  

And now, before I get to the best part, let me put in a bit of a background information for you...

I used to have a little girl in my life. She was a bundle of energy and I was her favorite playground toy. She was a gigantic smile with legs attached, and that smile only got bigger once I stepped through the back door. She wasn't mine by genetics or by marriage or anything like that. She was the niece of my best friend from college and, as I was over at her place on a regular basis, I got slapped with the appellation of Unka.

By the age of four, she had already had some hard times in her life. Her asshole father, an alcoholic. Her idiot mother, a crack addict. Her sister, born with defects due to her damn-fool mother not putting down the pipe while she was pregnant. Child Services had pulled them from the home twice and was about to do so a third time when her grandmother stepped in and yanked them out herself. I still remember that day, as this scared little smile came up to me and asked me to help her read a book. It was almost 18 years ago when I suddenly became an uncle, and it was one of the most blessed times of my life.

And that's all I could think about when I watched...

**Usagi Drop**

This is an anime that people get the warm fuzzies about even while they have no direct emotional connection to the situation. So for me, it was super effective. The entire emotional range, from Daikichi's determination to do things right to Rin's exceptional happiness, plucked at my tear ducts from the very first episode until the very end. Their struggle to become a family, regardless of how they became that way, resonated so well within me that all kinds of wonderful memories came flooding out of my mind and into the screen.

Normally, I'd spend a paragraph talking about art styles (similar to Hourou Musuko and Isshuukan Friends) or music (delightfully subtle, designed to support the script rather than overpower it) to the amazing voice acting work. But that would cheapen my experience too much. This wasn't a title to analyze and pick apart while holding each facet to the light of criticism to find out what was good and what wasn't. This was a title to simply take as a whole and appreciate for what it was: that family means family, regardless of how or why it came to be.

Last Sunday, my delightful smile turned 22. And, as she was leaving the bars after a 32-hour-long party to celebrate her birthday, she got a phone call from her favorite uncle so that I could tell her I loved her and to thank her for being in my life. Sure, she calls me all hours of the night as one boyfriend after another acts like a damn idiot. Sure, she pokes me on Facebook 848 times in a row just to hear me roll my eyes about it on Skype. And sure, she tells me way more than I really wanted to know about the trouble of having an entire harem of girlfriends that all hate each other's guts...

And I wouldn't have it any other way.

Because long ago, I chose to let a little girl into my heart. She's not my daughter, but she's as close as I'm ever going to get. I'm not her dad, although I was definitely the most stable father figure she had as a kid. But we're still family. And, just as between Daikichi and Rin, that is all that matters.

Score: 10/10  
Recommendation Level: Awwsome.

[**Steins;Gate: Soumei Eichi no Cognitive Computing \(4/4\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=27957) 

Just a neat series of shorts.

[**Spice and Wolf S2 \(12/12\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=5341)

Idk why I took a hiatus after S1. This series is pretty much everything I expected, but better. The banter was good, and as well I found the side characters to be more interesting than in S1, as well as the romance aspect more fleshed out. Of course my only complaint would be that we only got 2 more arcs, and no third season. One can always hope...

[**Neon Genesis Evangelion \(1-3/26\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=30)

This is almost exactly what I expected. Mechs, mental breakdowns, and futuristic society. Also there seems to be deeper issues at play, as well as the complex relationship between shinji and his father. A good set of introductory episodes that explain the basics but has not revealed the plot as of yet. Also I have no idea what dementia, as a genre, is.

Baccano! (13/13)

I had fun watching it, but was kind of underwhelmed given the huge amount of praise surrounding this show. The characters and setting were great, but the plot itself had a lot of cool buildup into a pretty bland ending, specifically for any of the post-Pussyfoot events. I liked the concept of letting the viewer piece together the story through flashbacks-forwards, but it was done almost too frequently, and fragmented the storytelling too much.

I was also pretty turned off by the whole immortality aspect of the show. It killed a lot of the suspense when certain characters went out to fight without any risk of dying (by normal means). For a world where the elixir is still unknown to the public, I felt like there was too many immortal characters. It kind of ruined any surprise factor of someone getting killed, only to be revealed for the first time of their immortality. 

But that's as far as I'll go with nitpicking. Definitely a fun ride of a show, and also the best dub that I've seen so far.

I'm currently watching the Raildex Franchise...finished index season 1 and half way through railgun season 2.

Finally got off my lazy ass and started watching **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** for the first time.  I just got to the part where it starts significantly diverging from the 2003 anime, [episode 12 ish](/s "The Greed vs. Fuhrer fight") and I must say I am not disappointed in the least.
>> ARTICLE
At the moment I'm 58 episodes into FMA Brotherhood. I can't believe I waited so long to finally watch it.

I spent this week finally sitting down and watching the **Monogatari** series. I had already watched Kaiki's arc and Hanamonogatari, so this was just me sitting down and actually watching the show in order. Or well, as "in order" as Monogatari gets.

It was a lot better than I had thought it was going to be, the last episode of each arc was almost always really good, but I had issues with the parts leading up to that. I didn't mind all of the talking, but when the characters start talking about stuff that isn't relevant to the story or the characters (most of the "comedy" and recurring gags) the show *really* grated on me.

Overall though, when it was good it was really good, and I'm looking forward to Tsukimonogatari next week. 
>> ARTICLE
Railgun S 13/24
I have read through the sixth volume so I already know what happened up to this point but I had kind of wanted to see it animated. I thought it pretty well done.

Barakamon 7/12
I can never seem to remember that Naru is a girl. She just looks like a few younger boy characters I've seen. Calligraphy is cool though. :)

My Little Monster 5/12
I have been enjoying this series for the most part so far. It like a much more light hearted version of Ao Haru. Mizutani's and Haru's academic battles remind me of KareKano (which is not a bad thing).
>> ARTICLE
Hi people.

So, this week was very much a let down for me. After being free from exams, I expected myself to get through a my backlog, but unfortunately, real life called and requested that I be present.

In any case, here we go.

**Hyouka (14-22/22)**
It's a pretty damn great show. Although I had put it on hold a long while ago, I picked it back up, and once I paid more attention and got to the know the characters more, I picked up more on the subtler bits. I love how it doesn't try to hit you over the head with any development, and it certainly got me interested in the mystery genre, which I had never liked before, so props to it for that.

**Rewatch of Hataraku Maou-Sama (2-7/13)**
Although I'm not finding it *as* funny as when I first watched it, I still enjoy the show a lot as a lighthearted romp. I still remember large plot points pretty well, so they aren't as much of a surprise, but the character interaction is still-top notch.

**Byousoku 5 Centimeter (1-3/3)**
Legit anime eye porn. I spent half the time in awe of the visuals, so I'll probably have to re-watch to appreciate the nuances that are (apparently?) present. At least it looked nice enough that my sister, (who hates anything to do with anime) appreciated it.

**School Days (5-8/12)**
It's not as utter crap as everybody says *yet*, but I usually feel too bored to watch it, so I'm not making too much progress on this.

In any case, I was catching up with the a lot of airing shows, and I watched a couple of episodes of Toradora for the rewatch, also couple episodes of some other shows, but not enough to form an opinion yet.
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal alchemist: Brotherhood (64/64)

This has got to be the most enjoyable anime I've watched yet. So glad I picked Brotherhood up! Loved the OPs and EDs and OSTs. I also really enjoyed how the anime explored the characters in quite depth and loved the character development they went through especially Greed. The ending was fabulously, fantastically satisfying.
Might seem bias or whatever but I would rate Brotherhood 10/10. Highly recommend this!
I've yet to see the first Fullmetal-Alchemist series.  Is it any good since it has its own original story?
>> ARTICLE
The first FMA covers some earlier manga chapters in more detail compared to Brotherhood, which brushed them off expecting you to already know what happened. However, the first anime veers off into anime-only territory, and the buildup for this starts off fairly early (it's interwoven). It's still pretty enjoyable, though - it went in quite a different direction than Brotherhood/manga and some of the themes differ, as well as the later plot and chars/ending.
>> ARTICLE
It's alright. I watched it first and liked it overall, but after watching Brotherhood, I think it pales in comparison. You might be kinda disappointed since you watched Bhood first, but it probably doesnt hurt to try.

Edit: btw, I completely echo your thoughts on brotherhood
>> ARTICLE
I finished Toradora! a couple of days ago. I really appreciated how it augmented the regular highschool romcom theme with bigger issues than just the interpersonal relationships between the students. I can't say I've seen other animes that address such issues so directly.

I feel I am the only one on the fucking planet that had so much interest in Ami and wanted WAY more time on her..

They kept cutting off her conversations by the last 5 episodes, it happened so many times It made me mad beyond words.

One of my favorite lines from her is .. *"maybe then... you might give me a second chance"* to Ryuuji, which he doesn't hear..
>> ARTICLE
nope, I'm right there with ya. Although I'm not upset at all with who ended up together, I wish Ami was given more of a spotlight.

I didn't want Ami to end up with Ryuuji, I just wanted to get a more clear redemption for her character.

Though it seems that she gets it and I was glad at the end. but the WAY they kept cutting her FUCKING DIALOGUE was 10/10 enraging
>> ARTICLE
Started **Mahou Shoujo MadokaMagica (4/12)** on a whim like two days ago, wasn't even on my PTW or anything. Dunno why I decided to. Anyway, really really liking this one so far. Seems pretty interesting. [Madoka Spoilers up to Ep4 and possible spoilers if my speculation is correct](/s "It's very clear from that not everything is as it seems. I don't have a good feeling about the little cat fucker. He's fucking up to something. I think I trust the Homaru lass a bit more than that snakey little Digimon lookalike. I also have a feeling that there's going to be a reveal about how the girls who make a contract with Kyubey are actually witches too, or at least they temporarily become witches when they transform into magical girls. I think that's why Homaru doesn't want Madoka to make a contract and why she wanted to kill Kyubey in the first episode.")

Can't really say there's anything I hate so far except the character designs. Their faces look squished, and to me it just looks bad. Something about it doesn't sit right with me, don't really know what it is. I do like the blue girls outfit design though. But overall, the art style is fine. Not the biggest fan of it but it's not like it hurts  to look at. It's quite pretty actually.

As for what I hope for in the series, I'm hoping [Spoilers](/s "that if Madoka makes a contract her wish is to have a combining Magical Girl Super Robot, kind of like the Getter Robos, to fight the witches. I'm really only joking about that but I wouldn't be opposed to it if it happened. If I'm actually being serious about what I'm hoping for, I hope Cubey or whatever the fuck his name is gets run over by a car. Oh, and I hope that what I think about the Magical Girls/Witches relationship is true. I like being proven right.")

Either way, I'm enjoying it so far and I'll have it finished for next week.

Also hoping to get New Getter Robo out of the way so I can start Getter Robo: Armageddon, which looks awesome. Do I need to watch NGR to watch GR:A?

Oh, I'm also probably gonna be rewatching Diebuster with a friend who hasn't seen it yet. Can't wait to see his reaction to the ending.
>> ARTICLE
How can you not trust the little cat creature? Just look at him.

Does this look like the [eyes of a liar](http://i.imgur.com/tBF1EsR.png) to you?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. Yes they do.

I actually watched up until Ep 8 now and [Madoka possible spoilers and TTGL spoilers](/s "I'm starting to think, while he may be a liar and a dick and clearly up to no good, that he actually has a good motive behind all this. Maybe he's like the Anti-Spiral in TTGL, he has noble goals but he's an absolute asshole in the way he does it. Dunno though, to be quite honest.")
>> ARTICLE
Havn't seen TTGL so I can't comment on that but [Madoka magica](/s "yeah he does have a motive, not going to go to deep into this since you havn't finished the whole series plus rebellion though, but there is a reason people hate him.")
>> ARTICLE
Was it you who told me to watch Neo Getter Robo vs Shin Getter Robo? Maybe not but someone else on this sub did. They gave me something about the three OVAs saying that it was fine to watch them in any order but Shin vs Neo, Neo, Armageddon is probably the best order. I also posted my thoughts on TTGL thus far in this thread which you said you were interested in.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that was me who gave you the list with the 3 OVAs. GR:A definitely seems the most adult of the 3, plus it looks really great from clips I've seen, so I want to watch that first. Not to say that NGR v SGR wasn't fun, but NewGR is kind of boring right now.

I'll read your thoughts on TTGL after this ep of Madoka, I'm on ep 8 now.

**Steins;Gate**: I finished the anime last night and it easily slid its way into my top 5 list. Episodes 21-24 were great. I watched Madoka before this and thought that the [](/s "time loop") was better done in Madoka (it was a bit dragged on in Steins;Gate) but overall it was good.

I watched Interstellar a few weeks ago and my friend was like "wow Steins;Gate did the whole premise better" which I have to say is true, Intestellar was more visually pleasing though.
>> ARTICLE
I remembered I used to watch Cardcaptor Sakura on CN when I was little, so I decided to watch it entirely now. I'm 5/70 episodes in and it's really funny and cute so far. Kero-chan best familiar.
>> ARTICLE
Finally worked my way through **Eureka Seven**. It was fairly good, however I am a sucker for unhappy endings/when someone important dies. Otherwise it was a good time, really like the end of the second season/beginning of the third. Best part is it just started streaming on Netflix so get after it kids.

**Eureka Seven (27-50/50)**

This show defiantly picked up in the second half compared to the first (not saying first was slow but there are some character developments which I had to bear with and defiantly payed off). In general, I was hesitant when I started the show, because I was confused what was going on, and I was still confused half way through, but some of the confusion cleared up, not a lot though. Tempted to check the wiki. On the whole, I did enjoy it quite a lot, I liked the themes presented, characters, action and music, OH GOD THE MUSIC IT'S AWESOME. Defiantly fits quite well. One thing that always made me irritated were whenever those kids showed up, they're very annoying. About the ending, I think it ended appropriately but there wasn't much of an epilogue. Well there was....sort of. Not fulfilling enough IMO. This show is defiantly a classic and I'm really glad I watched it.

**Eureka Seven: AO (1-4/24)**

It's...well...it's different. I mean, sure I can go with it, if they explain "When is this happening?" later or who the new enemies are. Currently very confused. Also, I feel the magic of original Eureka Seven is kind of gone, if that makes sense. Like the MC though, he is defiantly more...crafty.

Gintama 6/265 - enjoying it so far, need to catch up for new season!

Nagi no Asukara. Pretty good. On the last 7 episodes and plan to finish it tonight!

The first couple episodes of **Katanagatari**

Really loving it so far. I love the banter between Togame and Shichika. Reminds me a lot of Spice & Wolf. 
>> ARTICLE
At times it gets a little slow but don't drop it because the ending is a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
You are lucky, waiting an entire month for an episode was a torture by itself. You are in for a treat. Don't forget to watch the preview of the forth episode during the third.
>> ARTICLE
I watched this last month and I could hardly imagine how agonizing it must've been for the people that were watching as it aired.
>> ARTICLE
Started watching Spice and Wolf. I'm in the second season and [Spoiler](/s "Lawrence just got Holo back from Amarti.")

It's a good show. Some of the business stuff is a little bit confusing for me, but I can still figure out what's happening for the most part.

Holo is one of my favorite characters in any show. I really love the way she interacts with Lawrence.
>> ARTICLE
I watched all 13 episodes of Uchouten Kazoku (The Eccentric Family)

It was really fucking good. The character interactions were the real highlight of the show. I particularly loved the interactions between Yasaburou and Benten, and any interactions between the members of the family. Kaisei and Yasaburou's relationship was rather interesting as well, but they didn't expand much upon it. There were some fucking fantastic plot twists thrown in there, but overall I think that the story was very character driven. Overall, the show was just ridiculously fun, yet touching at times as well, which I felt drove it's themes in very well.

There were a few things that I wish were expanded upon however. For one, I'd like to know [Spoiler](/s "the full details on why Professer Akadama has his fucked up back, and how Benten learned to fly at the same time. I'd also like to know more about why exactly Kaisei was saying sorry. There's many reasons I can think of, but I'd like a straight answer. Benten was left as a big mystery too. She said she never truly got what she wanted, and they mentioned that she would come to the well and cry, but they never expanded upon it")

There was one little touch that I liked a ton. [Spoiler](/s "The guy who saved Yasaburou's mother in the end, and took care of her kept saying "to eat is to love". Benten constantly said that she loved Yasaburou so much she could eat him up. In the end, even though Benten could have eaten him on multiple occasions, she decided not to, and even helped him in the end. Then, the same guy who said "to eat is to love", said that "to not eat is also to love", which is exactly what I feel was what Benten was doing.")

Overall, it was a 9/10 for me. There were too many things left unexplained, and it was too short for me to give it a 10/10
>> ARTICLE
Thank you my friend for watching this. Not enough people have seen it, and I think they should. Also Kaisei best girl. 
>> ARTICLE
It was actually rather popular back when it was airing, and the episode threads were fairly packed. But it got overshadowed by Gin no Saji in the end-of-season analysis, so not a lot of people are still talking about it.

Which is a shame, as it is still a very worthy anime.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I've only gotten into anime in the past year and reddit a month ago, so I'm still playing catch up with shows that have already aired.
>> ARTICLE
I can agree to Kaisei being best girl. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching this right now (starting episode 7), and while I was on the fence for the first 3/part of 4 episodes, it's been fantastic ever since. Episodes 5-6 were so well done and touching. Can't wait to see how it turns out.

**IWASAMADETOHITINAMERIKA**

Really enjoyed this one. Characters were lovable. The CG was cringeworthy though. Also, watch it dubbed, as the japanese version has some awkward 'english' moments. **8/10**

**Nisemonogatari (11/11) - Nekomonogatari: Kuro (4/4) - Monogatari Series: Second Season (26/26)**

I was bored Thursday, so I decided to start catching up to Monogatari, because I didn't feel like finishing the last four episodes of Steins;Gate.

I finished both Nisemonogatari and Nekomonogatari: Kuro on Friday and I finished Monogatari Series: Second Season today.

I just love it. It might just have become my favorite show. I just love the characters (especially Karen), the setting, the writing, etc. Everything. 

I only got Hanamonogatari left to watch and then I'll have to wait for Tsukimonogatari.

I finished watching Code Geass R1, and while I liked it (especially with Lelouch being exactly the kind of MC I like watching) [Episode 22+ spoilers](/s "The whole situation with Euphy was a bit... weird. Her announcement was exactly what was necessary to completely ruin Lelouch's plan (even if she didn't do it on purpose) so him accepting it was definitely weird. Then the whole thing with Geass becoming permanently on felt a bit forced.")

[](/s "The sudden breakdown into a cold calculating bastard that he had immeadiately after was pretty neat though. His relation with C.C. is definitely confusing. It left me with quite a few questions about much of what happened in the last few episodes, but it still was so good at making me want to watch the next episode that") I'll rate it a 9/10.

it all good i still think im somewhat new to anime as well. (stared really watching anime in august this year)

>> ARTICLE
**Shinsekai Yori (25/25)**

I've been looking forward to watching this after I finished Psycho Pass a couple of months ago since there was a lot of comparisons between the two.The amount of world building that both shows do is just stellar, some of the best that I've seen. For Shinsekai, the way they structure their society was just fascinating to me and a big highlight for me was how they seemingly established a peaceful society based on the [Shinsekai Yori](/s "Bonobos and actually modifying the human genome with inhibitions and a death feedback to make a human society which contains psychic power users feasible"). The plot was okay and nothing really special, but the biggest gripe I had was with the characters themselves. I found that many of the characters to be insufferable, especially the main character Saki. A lot of comparisons can be made between Psycho Pass' MC Akane Tsunemori and Saki, but  in my opinion Akane was much more developed and actually [Psycho Pass S1 Spoiler]( /s "became pretty badass and stuck to her ideals and actually transformed from a weak, naive character to a strong one "), while Saki developed [Shinsekai Yori]( /s "what I call the Orihime syndrome of doing basically nothing really except constantly repeating out names of characters.") The only character worth noting from the entire series was probably Squealer and his [Shinsekai Yori](/s "struggle against the tyrannous humans. Because of this, I found the queerats and their struggles to be often more interesting than the struggles of the humans themselves, which was a shame because very little was seen from their side."). All in all , I feel like Psycho Pass was a much more enjoyable watch, though that may also be partially due to my bias towards sci-fi genres.

Nichijou. I think saying that i'm still laughing 2 hours later is enough

**White Album 2 (13/13)**

I watched this after seeing it hyped up a lot by people who have seen the show. The buildup over the first half of the series for the suffering that was to come was well handled and the characters were believable. The end result was painful, especially considering [](/s "that I thought Setsuna was best girl"), although it was quite predictable in my opinion. Overall I thought it was very good but nothing amazing. **(8/10)**

**Robotics;Notes (22/22)**

I ended up enjoying this more than I expected to. I liked all of the characters, especially Frau, and even the initially bland mc grew on me over the course of the series. I liked the use of technology in the series and found it to be a pretty realistic portrayal of where we could be at in 2019. The approach to juggling multiple plot threads at once the show used was interesting, however I felt like the end could have done a better job at tying it all together. **(8/10)**
>> ARTICLE
I agree with the bit about the ending. Great show overall, though there just felt like something was off. 

Frau is a bad influence on me. I watched the dub and for a short while afterwards I fell back into a habit of using webspeak. My roommates were not happy with me.
>> ARTICLE
I watched **Kids on the Slope**, and it was a really nice show dealing with friendship and love. The whole premise and story is pretty cliche, but I don't mind that at all because the execution of the show was nearly flawless. The only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 is because at times it was repetitive to the point of being predictable, and though being repetitive is not necessarily a bad thing, in this case it reduced some of the impact of the drama later on in the series. Overall though, I did like the drama despite most of it being avoidable by, you know... Talking. But that's okay, I've been in similar situations as the characters myself, and I probably handled them in an even worse way. So it was pretty realistic in that sense.

The music though... I don't know how many times it needs to be said, but Yoko Kanno is an absolute genius. The jam sessions were some of the highlights of the show, with the [festival performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOf3MVMPGOc) and [this session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKLHNkX_Z2Q) (from the dub) being some of my favourite moments of the show.

It was really cool seeing the whole culture of the time and place. It felt so... Real. And with MAPPA's animation and visuals, it made for a great setting and helped set the tone of the show. Some of the show wasn't relatable, but I'd say that's mostly because of the culture differences and not because the scenarios weren't realistic or well done. 

I'd be lying if I said I didn't cry at **SPOILERS** [the ending] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUyKtUwu6g), and the scene before it with [](/s "Sen and Kaoru jamming in the church") being very emotional as well. Pretty heart warming, if you ask me.

Finally, Sentarou x Kaoru is now one of my favourite bomances. Not quite Gon x Killua level, but their friendship is great and well portrayed. I like most of the elements in this show, but their friendship brings everything together and makes the show what it is.

**9/10** and one of my favourites.

**Nisemonogatari (11/11)** It was pretty good, though didn't feel as good as Bake in some aspects. **8/10**

Little bit of Psycho Pass and Magical Index Season 1, as I picked them up on BluRay, as well as Gurren Lagann Part 2 and Kill la Kill Part 3 that RightStuf managed to get to me yesterday.  KLK's dub is so damn good...  I'm usually a nitpicky bastard about dubs but it's one of the few that I feel was very well done.  Nui's voice makes me perfectly angry at her equally obnoxious character.  Fuck dat bitch.

Careful: Minor Spoilers (Kanon 2006).

I just finished Kanon (2006) version and have to say, i'm a little bit disappointed of the whole series. It's built up really slow and in the end, it doesnt really give you what you wanted to see after everything has happened. Two girls appear and disappear out of the blue, Makoto's sister comes and leaves in one episode (why'd you do this? auu...) and Mai gets completely left out of the series towards the ending, which is a personal disappointment, but not only that: she seems to be the one with the most deep relationship with Yuuichi, yet she's not that important at all...

I still really liked it and I'm glad that I watched it, but I dont think I'd recommend it to everyone. Anyone who likes emotional, slow-building animes, yes, thats perfect for you: everyone else, stay away.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Chihayafuru 1,2 and Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 . All of them very nice but I especially liked Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 which is in my opinion really beautiful and powerful anime. It left me in a feels pool. One of only  a handful of anime to ever do that.

Cowboy bebop, Sakamichi no Appolon, Aria the Animation

**Katanagatari (12/12)**

I was generally disappointed by this show. I've heard a lot about how great the action is, but I just generally found it pretty dull. The talking was usually more interesting.

The romance was pretty good, and Togame and Shichika generally got more likable as time went on.

People also say the ending is great, but I was disappointed. The [](/s "boss rush through all the sword bearers was interesting, seeing how much Shichika had been holding back, and it was probably the best fight in the show, but I didn't feel any sympathy for Princess Hitei at all, and I feel it would have been more realistic for Shichika to kill her, who ordered Emonzaemon to kill Togame, than the Shogun, who had nothing to do with it.") Overall, it was pretty lackluster.

**Shin Sekai Yori (7/25)**

I don't usually like dystopian future, but this is pretty engaging. With the rate at which they're answering the questions they raise, though, I think 25 episodes might be stretching it too far.

>> ARTICLE
**[Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou)** 6/26- I'm a big fan of random, quick, fast humor and this fits the bill.  Although I enjoy the series, this is not one that I can marathon.  After a few episodes, it starts to get a little repetitive.  To me, this is something that should be watched a little at a time to savor it. 

**[Sakura Trick](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20047/Sakura_Trick)** 6/12 - Need a little pick me up after watching a depressing episode or series and enjoy yuri?  This is something that will cater to you wholeheartedly.  This is like an epipen for an alergic reaction.  If this doesn't relieve at least a little bit of the heaviness of your heart after a depressing episode of a different series, man... This series pulls no punches and get straight into the feel-good awwww action straight on the first episode. There's no close calls or feigns.

I'm probably going to ration the rest of the Sakura Trick for rainy episodes from other series.

[Yowamushi Pedal] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/18179/Yowamushi_Pedal) **1-6/38(?)**

Pretty decent so far. The CGI takes some getting used to, but I like the character designs a lot. The pacing is also quite slow, but I dont mind that as much.

As for the characters, I like them all with the exception of Captain and the well built third year. Captain seems rather boring, and the other just gets on my nerves a bit.

However, the biggest thing I'm worried about is how they're going to keep the races interesting in the future...not that cycling is a boring sport, I just could never imagine it working as an anime. I guess I'll have to see though.

I'm kind of on a SoL kick right now. I blasted through **My Little Monster** and while it was alright, I wasn't super satisfied with how the show ended. 

Next I decided to watch the ever popular **School Days** after seeing it mentioned many times on this and other boards around the net. 

I thought I had reached the pinnacle of emotional influence caused by an Anime when I watched Oriemo(mad at MC, not the girl). Then I took this boat ride and I am unsure of how to fill the crater in my soul. 

Safe to say, I've been trying to convince my friends to watch School Days all week. ^^I ^^need ^^others ^^to ^^suffer ^^with ^^me

>> ARTICLE
***Megazone 23*** - A classic show from 1985, perhaps better known in the US as one of the three anime used to create "Robotech", and IIRC literally the second OVA to be created by the anime industry. It touched on themes like environmentalism and the possibility of cyberspace/internet, a very early look into cyberpunk genre in anime. It also has motorcycles that transform into robots that act as computer terminals for a giant super computer, varied character designs that are classic 80s style, and a nonsensical plot about supercomputer AIs that manipulate people's perception of reality. 7/10

***Mazinger Z eps 1*** - Go Nagai's most famous manga and show. The first episode goes through the origin story at breakneck speed. Two named characters die in the first episode. Baron Ashura is awesome.

***Casshern Robot Hunters*** - A good remake of the 70s classic. Great character design by Umetsu Yasuomi. Basically took the plot of the original series, took out all of the repetitive episodic episodes, fleshed out Braiking Boss' motivation, and updated the action scenes to 90s standard but still with the 70s style. 8/10

Half way through [Zetsuen No Tempest](/s"http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest"), Really enjoying it so far it has some interesting characters and a good setting. It also has a lot of literary references to Shakespeare so if anyone has an interest in that I suggest picking it up.
>> ARTICLE
Zetsuen no Tempest 1-24: Pretty good! The first half was really solid, though there were a few bumps afterward. I wasn't wild about the [changes in](/s "Hakaze's personality with her falling for Yoshino,") but I guess it's to be expected. It did affect the plot, I guess. I liked that I wasn't able to predict the twists and surprises that happened; I had theories, but they didn't turn out to be correct. For example, [when](/s "Hakaze went back in time and Aika revealed herself as the mage of Exodus, I expected her to kill Hakaze and transform her body to look like her own, causing the 'Aika' found dead to be Hakaze. Aika would then be the antagonist in the present timeline"). Needless to say, that didn't happen. With all the red herrings and twists, though, I suppose the rewatch value isn't as high since you already know what's true and what isn't.

Not sure what you mean by still airing becuase I am not up on methods of airing anime series.

I started Thursday night, finished the next day. I felt real good after finishing it. I didn't want to ruin the feeling so it took me a day to start another series. The feels are very relatable. Is the show a Slice of Life genre? Nothing crazy happens, just everyday life. 

I didn't know about the Christmas club threads until after i finished. So far i've gone in and joined(although im not re-watching, i might just jump in)

**Steins;Gate (24/24)**

As i type this out, 10 minutes ago i just watched the last episode. This was the show i watched after Toradora! I think it was a very solid show. Good amount of feels, good amount of character development, good pace, and nice story. The turning point made the show for me.

Honey and Clover Ep 1 and 2. 

Enjoying it so far and seems to hold up well enough.

>> ARTICLE
I watched The Ping Pong animation finally after putting it off due to the animation and must say i really enjoyed it. Surprised me with how much depth it gave for the characters , but also deep it was. I highly recommend people watch it :D 
>> ARTICLE
Just rewatched the first 2 Rebuild of Evangelion movies. God damn that's some nice animation. I hope they make the 4th movie more like theses 2 and less like the 3rd movie.
>> ARTICLE
**Toradora! - 16/25** I caught up to the rewatch club and decided to slow down my pace. Boy, I was not expecting to love Taiga or Ryuuji from the get go but holy crap those two are fantastic characters.


**Amagami SS - 25/25** I've been meaning to watch this show for such long time, since the days when all i saw on all the [sex hair](https://img.charahub.com/c217323_21ce2c51cfd8d5beaf9104fdbd0e95c3.jpg) talk on /a/. While Kaoru was my favorite girl overall, Ayatsuji and Morishima Arcs ended in the best possible ways.
>> ARTICLE
How DARE you? Morishima best girl
>> ARTICLE
She def had the better arc, I just love Kaoru. Dat cafe outfit!
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I saw it but I believed I liked the Morishima arc best in both seasons and that I enjoyed the Tsukasa arcs the most after that.

I just started Baccano! not even an hour ago

Fate Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya + 2wei for the GL... it exceeded my expectations in ALL aspects ;)

Just finished Kanon 2006, marking the end of my Key/KyoAni holy trinity show journey. I wish there were more shows like this, furthermore I wish we talked about Kanon and Air as much as we talk about Clannad, I think there's a lot of great discussion to be had (or re-had) about all the interesting differences, similarities and/or themes of Jun Maeda's work. In fact I just sat down and watched all the first episodes of Air, Kanon and Clannad again just to see if I could identify what it is that gives his work that certain feel that no other works can quiet replicate. I can honestly say that I can't put my finger on it. Honestly, I kind of prefer it that way. 

I want to continue to think of Air, Kanon and Clannad as these sort of ethereal expressions of the human condition that are just too perfect to be put into words. Now, I'm not saying the shows are perfect, they are close, but that isn't the point that's important to me, what's important is that there seems to be some base underlying truth behind these works that give them their clout over us, over our emotions, over our state, in that they deconstruct relationships in a way that seems to put the platonic before the romantic, this is apparent in Kanon especially.

 In Kanon, Yuichi constructs his relationships in a way that seems to ignore any romantic themes what so ever, in this respect, it can be said that Yuichi is acting in bad faith, but is that really so bad? Among other things, I believe Maeda believes that a relationship built under the premise of romance is doomed to failure. To sinfully over simplify, think of a relationship as an empty cup,  it can be filled with anything you wish, but you must be careful as you only have one cup and nothing to wash it with, you must drink but you don't want to compromise the integrity of the cup, you don't want to over commit and put something too strong in it that will resonate in every drink you make there after. For example lets let a deep red wine represent romance (A choice as poetic as it is pragmatic - a contradiction one may think, but again, this is love we're talking about and as such I have no qualms about leaving a reasonable amount of logic at the door - that's a joke, now go back to skeptically taking me semi serious) You can fill a cup with red wine and drink it just fine, but from that point on you can either continue to drink red wine or have whatever else you want the cup be filled with vaguely taste of red wine. Which isn't a bad thing necessarily, it just is how it is. You've committed your cup to harboring wine residue for... a while. I recognize this metaphor has holes, but please, for now just take it at face value. Without giving too much away, I believe Yuichi's cup reeks of sour wine after the first arc, and you can see this in his character as he approaches each new arc with each new girl very... platonically, not that he didn't in the first arc as well, however that one did end up ... the way it did - the other few didn't... and now I wish I had someone to talk to about this who cares as much as I do. Because I have more to say and I just realized I've strayed off my thesis. 

TL;DR - Jun Maeda is onto something. Also, someone talk to me about Air, Kanon* and Clannad. 

*Emphasis.

Claymore is fucking good. Ending was way different to the rest of the show, [](/s "so much build up then nothing happens"). Only thing I didn't like was Raki, why did he have to be such a bitch.

Toradora

Was #1 on my "plan to watch" list and finally finished it, loved it, recommend it to everyone

Toradora and white album 2. Really enjoyed both of them
 Although white album didn't make me cry, it was pretty sad and Toradora had me with a big smile on my face in a lot of episodes. Really recomed both
>> ARTICLE
i Just started Bakemonogatari (2012) 
>> ARTICLE
Because I missed last week I'm going to make this post 2 weeks worth of anime (I actually didn't watch too much).

**Sekai Seifuku** (ep5-12)  
Very thought out funny little story about family, belonging and childhood. Some very nice visuals aswell.
Probably one of my favourites this year. (Rating: 8/10)

**Angel's Egg** (movie)  
This was a very mood heavy piece.
Really interesting watch but also very very heavy. Not going to rate it until I know more about it.

**Hotarubi no Mori e** (movie)  
This was good, I guess? For my liking a bit too short so that the end was kind of predictable although articulated really well. (7,5/10. 7 on MAL)

**Guilty Crown** (ep 10-11)  
Okay, now I can see where the trainwreck starts.

**Toradora!** (ep2-14 christmas watch)  
It's fine for now but doesn't really do something really good yet. A lot of above average episodes but that's it.  
>> ARTICLE
I literally JUST watched Gurren-hen.

Ah, watching TTGL all over again makes me emotional in so many ways. I liked the slight changes they made with the fight against the Four Generals for the most part except for the final scene. It was like [ ](/s ""Hey here's an even bigger baddy. Let's... uhhh... kill it in one shot."") 

Overall a great one. 9/10. Moving on to Lagann-hen.


>> ARTICLE
Lagann-hen is all the feels.. at the ending
>> ARTICLE
The final fight in Lagann-hen is probably my favourite in anime. So fun, so crazy.
>> ARTICLE
**Gurren Lagann** Finally started this series, only about 3 episodes in but can see why it has such a high reputation. Really like the animation style. The mix of humor and action is great.

**Hellsing Ultimate**- (4/10) I don't think I've ever seen hellsing discussed here. Maybe because since It came out vampires and zombis became over saturated in the media (especially western media). I'll admit that I think vampires can be pretty cool as long as they are done right (*Near Dark* is a pretty cool 80's vampire movie).Its a fun series so far and the action is pretty entertaining

**Outlaw Star** (Completed) It's been compared to Cowboy Bebop but all they have in common is a group of assorted weirdos flying around in a red ship. Outlaw Star has much more of Star Wars feel to it, as it takes place in the way distant future and has robots and aliens and stuff. The ending left a little more to be desired as although it wasn't a terrible unresolved cliffhanger, it was clear they had more stories they wanted to tell. It turns out they wanted to do a follow up OVA but that obviously never happened.
 
>> ARTICLE
**Familiar of Zero**

It isn't really anything groundbreaking but it's a decent ecchi comedy, which I enjoy once in a while.

**Dog Days S1** (I still haven't finished Season 2)

I really enjoyed it, mainly because of all the cute puppy-girls. Animation is pretty, too.
>> ARTICLE
**[Silver Spoon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19363/Gin_no_Saji_2nd_Season) (S2 7-11/11)**-
Wow. This series is not perfect (I had a bit of an with the pacing at the end and some other minor things), but it is still probably one of my favorite series I've seen so far. It feels more like an actual slice of life than many other shows I've seen in the genre with the themes it delves into (especially season 2). I haven't watched FMA (or FMA:B; I still haven't decided if I want to watch the 2003 version first or just watch Brotherhood), but if this quality is typical of Arakawa's work it gives me even more reason to rectify that.

**[Cromartie High School](http://myanimelist.net/anime/114/Sakigake!!_Cromartie_Koukou) (1-9/26)**-
I can't say I've seen an anime comedy quite like this so far. Not every joke and/or episode works (ep 3), but it's hit/miss ratio on the jokes is still solid. This series probably doesn't merit any sort of deep analysis, but I've enjoyed its absurd sense of humor the majority of the time, which is really all I ask for in a gag series like this.

**[Macross](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1088/Macross) (1-3/36)**-
This is the first mech series I've watched (sans FLCL), and it's also the oldest anime series I've watched to date. Not much to say so far, as these episodes have been mostly setup, but nothing has happened that has been a major turnoff. I'll be interested to see where it goes.
>> ARTICLE
Just watched steins;gate in one sitting last night. Good god did it live up to the hype. 
>> ARTICLE
Finished FLCL with friends. I liked it more or less but the ending was fairly unsatisfying compared to the rest of the show. The whole ending just didn't do much for me to be honest. Still interesting and really great artwork.

Finished Gundam: 08th MS Team. I really liked it overall. The battles are all great with really interesting tactics. The character's are all top notch with great character arcs for all of the main ones. In terms of character's I really think this is the Cowboy Bebop of Gundam. They're all likable and good natured with interesting interactions between them all. There's some effort put to comedic relief of sorts that goes a long way. At the same time though I think the show does a fantastic job displaying the core UC gundam themes. The villains are devious and the heroes are heroic but soft sides are shown to the enemy that make you really sad when they get picked off. The whole "war is hell" theme works fantastically here making it yet another great anti-war gundam show. I think it would probably be a fantastic starter Gundam honestly for anyone interested with the mild caveat that the war that set's the backdrop isn't really explained. That's to say the series doesn't talk much about the opposite sides, the whole universe setting, or what caused the war. I think this could easily just extenuate the idea that war is pointless even more so to a potential watcher though. There ends some of the text I used over on /r/trueanime a few days ago. I finished the show since then so I can talk a bit more about it. Episode 11 is the true ending of the show and 12 is pretty garbage. I'm not sure I would recommend people not to watch it but don't expect anything good out of the episode. I'll give the show a 9/10 with -1 point just because of the last episode.

I picked TTGL back up again from being on hold and watched from episode 11-18. I'm disliking it quite a bit yet again. The enormous amounts of complete bullshit asspulls ( which for me should NEVER happen in a good mecha show) and lack of logic in character's actions annoy me quite a bit. With regards to the mecha asspulls: the fact that a machine can powerup with new modifications (and just produce larger parts out of fucking nowhere) defeats the purpose of a mecha. Mech's are man made machines that have a distinct set of specs and abilities depending on it's design is integral to it's definition. The fact that TTGL laughs at this concept in the face in order to give absurd plot armor to the main character annoys me to no end. A lot of character's annoy me too ( to the extent of wishing they didn't win all the time). Nia is probably the mostly guilty as the pattern with her is that when everyone thinks it's a lost cause she gives some bullshit speech about how she believes in Simon and it definitely will be ok- is extremely annoying. The her meaningless speech comes to fruition with Simon pulling through out of nowhere. Other character's are guilty of their own flaws with plenty just being horribly developed to the point where I really don't give a shit. Simon is insufferable for the most part. Moving on from the characters... A lot of parts of the story don't make much sense. The unexplained rivalries didn't make much sense until they were explained... which in turned leaves even more blatantly unanswered questions. [Spoiler TTGL](/s "The conflict between the beastmen and humans was pretty nonsensical until explained... then the Spiral-Antispiral conflict is even more horribly explained. Why is there a rivalry between the two factions?" ) My most recent issue is with the reaction of the public to the most recent events in the story: it just doesn't make any sense. Hell they don't even try to provide reason to it. The show is just saying that the public is idiotic and not justifying it. 

So ends my rant on my last week of shows. Sorry if it wasn't even vaguely concise but I had a lot to talk about with TTGL and didn't want to just say its bad with not enough reasoning because we all know what would happen then. Some ratings for the shows I talked about: FLCL-7 Gundam 08th MS Team-9 TTGL-3( Thus far). 
>> ARTICLE
This is probably a mess to read as I'm posting this at like 3 in the morning  and I'm tired, sorry about that.

Just read your thoughts on TTGL, I definitely see where you are coming from. I think in this case it's certainly a matter of opinion. You obviously have a set preference for what you look for in the mecha genre, and TTGL goes against a lot of that, so it's completely reasonable for you to not like it. Hell, even if TTGL is my favourite anime, I'll agree with you that it's not really a good mecha show. The mecha don't really feel like they have any weight, and all their hits seem to lack impact. The Gunman don't really feel like mecha to me, they feel like just some suit that upgrades the characters or something.

That said, TTGL was never really a mecha show to me. I thought it was a brilliantly executed coming of age story, with likable characters, great symbolism, a neat soundtrack (probably Gainax's weakest though) and a really fantastic artstyle. I was told  by this subreddit that it's not really a mecha show, so I didn't go in with that mindset, which may have impacted how I viewed it. I can't really go in depth into my thoughts on the themes and stuff because that would contain spoilers but if you're around in the next thread and you've finished it I'll post my own thoughts too then.

Anyway, just going to adress a couple of points. 

>The enormous amounts of complete bullshit asspulls

TTGL is pretty much a love letter to the Super Robot genre, which pretty much prides itself on absolute bullshit asspulls just to be cool. After looking at your MAL again, and reading over your points, I think you might just not be a fan of the Super Robot genre for the most part. It's clear you love a lot of Real Robot shows, and the Super Robots shows I can spot that you've watched are arguably not really Super Robot at all, as they incorporate a lot of Real Robot elements into them at the same time. 

>that a machine can powerup with new modifications (and just produce larger parts out of fucking nowhere)

This is yet again a tribute to the Super Robot genre. A lot of Super Robots are designed with toys in mind so they avoid having any massively important parts out of nowhere just so it's easier to sell toys that combine together. On the other hand, there are some that are designed without these combining toys in mind, so you get a lot of Super Robots that just have shit coming out of nowhere. One of the earliest examples is Getter Robo. So you could either think of it as bullshit, or as a tribute. It depends on your opinion and there isn't really a wrong answer to it in the end of the day.

Actuall, TTGL has a reason behind this, which also ties in to why the [TTGL](/s "Anti-Spirals are fighting the Spirals.") Can't really explain how because of spoilers though.

Anyway, it's like 3 in the morning here now so I'm going to stop there. I see where you're coming from with what you don't like in the series, and I can see why you don't like it, and I can even see you're justification for giving it a 3/10 so far. I still love the series to death though, and I'll probably have something ready next week about why I love it so much. Might even start a thread asking why people's favourites are their favourites, I'd love to see the answers. I think everyone has a series that is special to them and while asking 'hat is your favourite anime?' is kind of uninteresting and boring, I think asking 'Why is your favourite anime your favourite?' would lead to much more intersting results.

I think it's sad that you're still getting downvoted even though you gave reasons. You were at +1 when I upvoted you from zero and now you're back down again. It's really ridiculous, and I see it happening a lot on this subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry if you felt that I was trying to convince anyone of my opinion: my intention is almost always with these things to give my opinion on these things and reasoning-not actively convince people otherwise. The part about the mech designs not having weight has a lot of resonance with. The face designs alienated me quite a lot from the start-I just don't like them. They look kind of silly and I guess the only reason that I see that design choice being used is to look sort off silly and display emotion of the people in them;it might be a bit hard to display the emotion of some of the stranger looking beastmen without them. I guess it was kind of hard for me to accept that it wasn't a real mecha show coming into it. I had heard that but couldn't really accept it to let me enjoy the silliness of the show. Most of your positives are fair although I wasn't really a fan of the characters as you saw. I haven't really noticed the soundtrack really. It has a large lack of "hype songs" that play during badass parts of the show like Kill la Kill ( DONT LOSE YOUR WAYYYYY) and Gunbuster (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEEPosF-tNU). I get the whole thing about Super robot tribute certainly. My experience with the genre is limited to Neo Getter vs Shin getter and Gunbuster really. As for why I more or less liked those and not TTGL... Gunbuster was just awesome; it was inspiring x10, had fantastic science fiction elements, and one fucking awesome mecha. Shin vs Neo just never even tried to take itself seriously in the slightest so I was able to have some fun watching it. Anyways that's about all I have to say for now. Sorry to keep you up so late and thanks for the chat. Definitely post that thread you are talking about, I would LOVE to do that for my favorite show(s). It would probably be NGE, Zeta Gundam, and Gunbuster that I would do it for but I might omit NGE since I expect so many people to write it up.
>> ARTICLE
> Sorry if you felt that I was trying to convince anyone of my opinion: my intention is almost always with these things to give my opinion on these things and reasoning-not actively convince people otherwise.

I perfectly understood that. I just wanted to share my opinion too, sorry if I came off a bit aggressive pushing it or anything. I probably should've included that I didn't want to change yours either.

Yeah, the faces can look silly. I personally like them but I can see why you don't. I think it's also another one of those Super Robot tribute things, I'm guessing the idea of faces on the chest and stuff came from [GaoGaiGar](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090304201039/gaogaigar/images/4/48/Gaogaigar.gif) and other similar robots that have some kind of animal things on their chests, and I always saw Gurren Lagann's shades as some sort of parody of [Mazinger Z's](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130130022141/mazinger/images/a/a7/MazingerZ-front.jpg) red things on it's chest that kind of look like a pair of shades. I dunno, I think the designs work for some but not others. Hell, I even saw a guy on the /toy/ board of 4chan who spent $1000 dollars on Gurren Lagann figures because he loved all the designs so much, and he hadn't even seen the show. Though I personally prefer the designs of bulky mecha like Gunbuster and the Evas (not rebuild though), I still like the designs of the Gunman. I even have a TTGL artbook with all the designs in it.

Definitely agree that there isn't enough hype songs, the only ones I would really count are [Sorairo Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNQvLECht08) and [Libera Me From Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V7aUT13qtM), and each only plays like twice at most, sadly.

Characters are definitely something TTGL does wrong. The only characters that really have any development are Simon, Kamina, Viral and Lordgenome. Kittan is pretty good too, but his whole character is really only defined by one moment. The rest of the characters don't really get any development.  That said, Simon is my favourite anime character alongside Shinji Ikari.

I'll try and make the thread this week but I might not be able to since I might be a bit busy around Christmas. I'd say go for writing about NGE too, even if two people share the same favourite, their reasons may be wildly different. That's the thing about favourites, they're not neccasarily the best you've seen, they're what you enjoyed the most and a lot of the time they're shows that are special to you.
>> ARTICLE
Yea GaoGaiGar and Mazinger Z(Hen) are shows I still need to get to eventually.  Sorairo days counts I suppose but I've noticed that a lot of time it's placed after a battle is won or at the end of the episode. Or am I just recalling that incorrectly? Libera me From hell... I don't like it that much personally. Rap couldn't stand out that well against an epic backdrop and the opera was a bit strange. I'm ok with Viral and Lordgenome. Kamina was ok and a lot better towards the end( [Spoiler](/s "ironically I think his very last few scenes were the best in the show") ). Another reason for NGE is that it's been so long since I've actually seen it. I'm a lot less sure that it should occupy my #1 spot than I used to be. I just don't remember the show well enough to give it a good thoughtful endorsement.
>> ARTICLE
> I've noticed that a lot of time it's placed after a battle is won or at the end of the episode

Sorairo Days is only played like twice I think, once after the battle against Lordgenome and the second time during the final battle. It's the opening too, obviously. There's a similar song that plays twice called ['Happily Ever After'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFahCRRS1K8) during ep 11 and 15.

 [Spoilers](/s "Even though Kamina dies in episode 8 I think his character just gets more and more developed after his death. You learn in I think episode 11 that he's not really a badass, he's really a complete wimp. The only thing he's really good at is pretending to be one and inspiring his friends. In actuality, he has no actual willpower of his own and could only go in because of Simon, and therefore he had the lowest Spiral Energy output in the series. The only reason he had enough to manifest the Giga Drill was because he wanted to protect Simon. Kind of sad, really.")

Yeah, I need to get around to rewatching it again myself. I rewatch EoE a lot though. It's my favourite movie ever.
>> ARTICLE
Yea that sort of sums up how I feel about Kamina. It didn't make much sense to me how so many people on this sub call him the ultimate badass in anime.
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching tons of anime this week:

**Psycho Pass** (2 seasons, sub): 8/10 for the first season and 7/10 for the second. Akane grows a lot, Makashima is a great villain, the dystopian Japan is a fantastic setting.

**The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya** (2 seasons + movie, sub): Overall a 8/10, excluding the mostly-skipped Endless Eight arc. I would love to adopt Kyon's narration as my inner voice.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion** (1 season + EoE movie, sub): 8/10. Fantastic story, great characters, art has aged somewhat well (lip flaps aside). Would get in the fucking robot again. (Watching the trilogy next...)

**Tokyo Magnitude 8.0** (1 season, sub): 9/10, would cry again. Touching story, great art on the ruins of Tokyo.

**Outbreak Company** (1 season, sub): 7/10. Love the premise (especially after reading the similar Gate - Thus the JSDF Fought There, which is getting an adaption of its own), lovable characters, and I managed to get the references.

**Plastic Nee-san** (1 season, sub): 7/10. Nichijou is one of my all-time favorites because of its weird humor, and Plastic Nee-san manages to entertain in the same way in only 25 minutes.

**No Game No LIfe** (1 season, sub): 8/10. Again, love the premise (like Outbreak in some ways), characters are adorable and likable, the comedy is top-notch, and I want more.

**Little Witch Academia** (movie, sub): 7/10. It's adorable, it's gorgeous, and it reminds me of classic Disney in terms of quality. A nice breather.

**Afro Samurai: Resurrection** (movie, dub because Samuel L. Jackson): 7/10. Entertaining, gory follow-up to the original. SLJ continues to deliver really well.

**Madoka Magica** (1 season, 3rd movie in progress, sub): 9/10. Urobutcher pls.
>> ARTICLE
You went through most of my favorites in a week.  I'm kinda jealous for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
Heh. Someone else that watched Little Witch Academia this week. Nice.

Now go give [Death Billiards](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14353/Death_Billiards) a shot. It also came from the same project as LWA, and is eminently worthy.
>> ARTICLE
Seems interesting enough, so I've added it as the 107th entry to my backlog. Thanks for the suggestion.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time contributing to this thread so please bear with me T_T

[**Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou (1-12/12)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=21405)

Really loved this, the art style was a bit odd to me at first but it really grew on me. I didn't like it quite as much as Sakurasou, but I liked Ritsu better than Autism-chan or Aoyama so it's hard to say. Season 2 when??

***9/10***

[**B Gata H Kei (1-5/12)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=7817)

This show is hilarious, I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes the more humorous side of Ecchi rather than just fanservice. I also think the voice acting for the MC is spot-on, she sounds perfect for how she acts.

So far I'd give it an ***8/10***

[**Gatchaman Crowds (8-9/12)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=18229)

Hmmm, this show. I really liked how it started but my interest is kinda waning in it, I love all the characters but I don't really like how the plot is progressing around this part of the show, hopefully the end redeems how I feel about it now.

Probably like ***6/10*** at the moment, I'm not good at rating shows I haven't finished, especially this one since I liked it a lot earlier on.

I don't *think* any of this needed spoiler tags but if you think it did just tell me and I'll add them.

>> ARTICLE
Finished **Angel Beats**, which honestly was not at all emotionally impactful for me. Yes, even that last scene. The plot just felt too fast, like in [episodes 11-13](/s "the shadows come out of nowhere and then the next episode they're gone for no apparent reason? And the romantic plot developed spontaneously...don't even get me started.") The comedy parts were good but that's really it for me, I'm only rating it 6/10 for the comedy, art, and music. 

Watched episode 8 of **Gurren Lagann**. [vague spoilers](/s "I got spoiled on what was going to happen but ;_;")

Watched up to episode 19 of **Cowboy Bebop**. I'm still liking it a lot, although it's really, really hard for me to marathon. I know that the last few episodes are less episodic, but I don't know from what point..
Side note: the two episodes with Gren were incredible. Especially the opening/ending parallel of the second one. Goddang, so good.

Once break starts I'm going to actually have time to finish Gurren Lagann, and then I'll be watching an episode of **Katanagatari** a day. I know absolutely nothing about it, which is honestly the way I prefer to watch shows, and I can't wait.
>> ARTICLE
went and re-watched Cowboy BeBop and am now starting Gintama. 
>> ARTICLE
just finished up **Durarara!!** this week and its one of my favorite anime the way it ended. I loved how Kida Anri and Mikado kept their secrets from each other and its take others to help draws those out. That  punch by Simon was totally awesome. oh and shizuo being cool as fuck even [spoiler](/s "after getting shot") is always fun the way it turns out.  I cant wait to for the second season next year.

Finished up **Jojo's Bizarre Adventure** as well and what an awesome way to end it. Jojo planning everything out as usual is awesome to even if it doesn't work out for him.  my favorite part which was kinda scary to me is[major spoilers](/s "Kars is lying on the ground defeated as Stroheim and the German are preparing to blast him with the Giant UV ray beam and Kars' head turns to them with the mask on and he becomes a god absorbing all the power."). I watched the first episode of **Stardust Crusaders** to see how the story would go and it looks hype. Having a stand that costs a  30,000 yen camera every time he uses it doesnt seem like the best ability. I hope I'll see that joseph still uses hamon in Stardust Crusaders. Anyway one of my favorite series.

Started **Evangelion** and got through the first 2 episodes of the series. It seems interested and has a cool sense of humor in it in some way. I like the mech in it b/c compared to the 3 mech series ive watched (Aldnoah.Zero, TTGL and Code Geass), the way that  eva works (at least from the 2 episodes i watched) seems to be more biomech which seems really interesting. cant wait to watch more of it.

keeping up with **Toradora** as well and im still liking it as a first time watcher. the show has its flaws here and there but not too significant enough to point out. Im really excited to see where the story will go now.

Watched the **DBZ: Broly- The Legendary Super Saiyan** movie on toonami and well it has its flaws. The actual story of of it was really good imo and the fight between Broly and the Z fighters showed off how powerful he was and that the Z fighter were no match against him. The way it ended imo wasnt the best [spoiler](/s "where goku gets his friends powers to be able to kill Broly") was kinda like meh i felt like it coulda gone a better way but whatever. And hungover Roshi do even know wtf the fuck your doing? 

tried to watch **Akria** on toonami too but I was getting tired and was like screw this im going to bed or i'll forget about half the shit that went on in it (only prob got like 20 min).

Finished **Gosick** this week. Wasn't amazing, but it's definitely a good show. Most of the characters were pretty bad and some things that happened were a little bullshit, but it had a great overarching storyline which always kept me entertained. Overall, it was a fun ride and I'd definitely recommend it if you like anime with Mystery, Romance and Supernatural elements in it. **7/10**

Also started my **Durarara!!** rewatch (in celebration and preparation of the second season) a few days ago and currently on episode 5. It's one of my absolute, all-time favorite anime and I'm having a blast experiencing it again. It really is an amazing anime. **10/10**

Kill la Kill (6/24)

*Holy shit.*

People told me this was awesome and I didnt listen, the ecchi was too much. I checked out the first chapter when it aired but ya know... too much and not understanding anything about what is going on didnt help.

Still, forced myself to do the 3 chapter thing since most of the shows that I was following this season have ended.

Its awesome if you just let it be, dont ask questions and just sit back and enjoy the show, ala popcorn movies.

9/10 for now

Watched NGE for the first time ever. About to sit down and watch EoE... That fucking ending though.. What. Literally nothing happened. Someone explain.

So, episodes 25/26 take place during End of Evangelion. If you watch EoE and then 25/26 you can work out which scenes fit in, but there is also a fan cut where some very dedicated soul has cut the episodes into the appropriate places of EoE.

If you can find it, its definitely worth watching that way.

same here. watched the tv series and the end movie and then the rebuild series. whole bunch of awesome fuckery. I recommend you to go to the [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/) and read the sidebar and search within for fan theories.

Hunter x Hunter (1/148)

This one was so weird. I've read so many reviews and they all said this was an amazing anime, yet I just couldn't get into it. I watched the first episode a few times and dropped it every time.

Then this holidays I was looking for an anime to watch and I literally couldn't find anything. So I decided to give Hunter x Hunter a try again. I would force myself to watch at least 20 episodes so I wouldn't have any excuses anymore. If it was bad I would just drop it. Little did I know this anime would be one of the best, if not the best anime I've watched in a very long time.

It started off slow. Kinda childish, but seeing as it's shounen it's to be expected. But as the show started progressing, I started seeing why this anime was so highly praised. The evolution the characters go through, even the enemies is amazing. This anime is really thought provoking and I really loved that.

[Spoiler](/s "So, like I said, the series started off really slow. I kind of enjoyed it, but it was nothing interesting. Slowly but surely more interesting characters started showing up and you could clearly see where this show was headed.")

[Spoiler](/s "It started with the blooming friendship between Killua and Gon. Two contrasting personalities, yet somehow it just clicked. Hisoka, the chaotic neutral. He just wanted a challenge, someone strong to fight. One of my favourite characters in this anime. Simply amazing antagonist.") 

[Spoiler](/s "The show started becoming really amazing in the Yorknew Saga though. The Phantom troupe. Kurapika looking for vengeance, doing everything it takes to avenge his clan. Somewhat clich, but it was really well executed. And you could see the show becoming darker and more mature.") 

[Spoiler](/s "The Greed arc I really didn't like. It was a drag and I just plowed through it hoping the show would get better...")

[Spoiler](/s "And then I got to the Chimera Ant arc. It was weird. I almost dropped the entire anime after seeing the first few episodes of this arc. It just couldn't keep me interested. I didn't really feel a connection to Kite and the Ants and I wasn't about to watch an arc that was of the same level as the Greed arc.
Lucky for me I didn't quit. The arc had a slow start but I couldn't, in my wildest dreams, have imagined that it would bloom so beautifully. It was one of the best arcs of anime I've ever watched. The evolution of the protagonist. Gon usually always so happy, cheerful. Determined, yet always fair. Seeing him succumb to his emotions. Seeing him fall down in a pit so deep, even Killua couldn't get him out. ")

[Spoiler](/s "Seeing Netero, I always knew something was off about him. Yet I always tended to compare him to yamamoto from bleach. The thing is, he wasn't even close to the same. ")

[Spoiler](/s "Shaiapouf. The only character that I truly despised in this arc. All the other characters seemed somewhat human. But he was the true bad guy in this arc. Even though his actions resulted from his loyalty to the king, I still didn't like this guy. Now I'm talking about personal feelings, not about how well the character was written, because that was all fine and dandy.")

[Spoiler](/s "Seeing the King. At the start of the arc, I thought he was a typical bad guy. Somewhat the same as Aizen was in Bleach, or Madara from Naruto. Just Overpowered bad guy who will kill everyone at the end until he forces the protagonist to power up and destroy him. I couldn't have been more wrong. He was such a beautifully written character. Sometimes I wondered if he was the good guy, and that Netero and the guys fighting him were the evil ones.")

[Spoiler](/s "All the side characters were amazing too, but there was just too many good stuff to name it all. ")

[Spoiler](/s "All in all this anime was a masterpiece. It had a slow start but this anime went above and beyond the shounen genre. It was an amazing piece of art and the animation was beyond amazing. The sad thing about this anime is the fact that it has ended and that I won't be able to see how it ends for a very long time. I really hope that the manga will stop going on hiatus, so we can see how this masterpiece ends. 
I give this anime a 10/10. And I do not give those out lightly")

**Ping Pong: The Animation (11/11)**

Wow this show, this show was something else. Every character in the show was a blast to watch through. Seeing each character's journey and their development throughout the show was amazing. I loved it, the artwork was amazing, the OST was just on a whole new level and god, did I love that ending to the show. It was great and I can easily say the show is now in my top 3

I actually went and looked it and when I found out what it meant, I was just in Awh at how great the author was with his writing.

Seeing it in the anime and Smile finally recognizing what Peco meant with that phrase just made my jaw drop even more, the small things the author does to portray growth for the characters was just amazing.

**Clannad: After Story**

Mind blown. There's not much I can say, 1st half is really good at showing how life can be, and the second half is simply amazing. The ending was a bit weird, but [](/s "it did a good way at using the other world thing and what Kotomi knew about the other world"). Loved it.

10/10

**5cm per second**

Had a deep meaning behind it, but I didn't really enjoyed watching it. Not bad, but was expecting something more.

7/10

**Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu**

(Broadcast)

Watched this mostly for the movie, but ended up enjoying this a lot. Some flaws here and there, but had a blast watching it.

8/10

**Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009)**

(Rewatched 1st season and 2nd in chronological)

Eh. Not as good as the first one. The time travel episode was really good, and the concept of the Endless Eight arc was good aswell but, 8 episodes was too much. The film arc was meh.

6/10

**Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu**

Reminded me of the Steins;Gate movie, but this one didn't disappoint. Felt like 2h42min was too much, there was times where I had to take a pause. Doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it though, the movie was really good but doesn't quite reach the 10.

9/10

First time I am in this kind of thread, i suck at reviewing
>> ARTICLE
I just finished 5 centimeters per second too and I have to say it left me wanting more. I enjoyed the story but from what I heard I was expecting more especially in the feels department. I liked the second story where it's said that they didn't really know what they were doing and that all they could do was what they could, but other than that I didn't think the dialogue/lessons were too much to write home about. The visuals were amazing though...

**Monster 58-74**

Very good show, I highly recommend it. It is extremely slow the whole way through though which makes it kind of difficult to marathon. You almost want some time between some episodes to ensure they have your full attention.

[Ending spoilers](/s "So first off I was really sad Grimmer died. He was one of the best characters in the show. On the contrary, I was overjoyed when Roberto died. I hated that guy with a passion. It almost felt like he was just helping Johan for no reason until they finally said he was at 511 Kinderheim. It was very fitting that Tenma ended up killing absolutely no one in the end. It's just hard to see him actually go through with something like that even if the whole story was based around it. In the end the whole story was about Johan's rejection by his mother.")

**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun 1-8**

It's all right. The humor relies mostly on the characters' reactions which doesn't resonate very well with me. Not much is really laugh out loud funny.

Also you should vote for what I watch after GSNK [here](http://strawpoll.me/3282307).

Haven't watched a whole lot because of christmas but still

**Little Witch Academia** (movie)  
Cute little witch story. Liked the style. Way too short though. (Rating: 7/10)

**Kyousou Giga** (ep1)  
This show is fking busy and that's why I couldn't really watch it during christmas (have to pay too much attention). But I like the visuals and themes. Definitely high potential.

**Toradora!** (ep14-22 christmas watch)  
After a lot of setup we get to the meat. I'm curious for the final conclusion. Otherwise a pretty typical romcom-drama that's executed really well.

**Guilty Crown** (ep12)  
This kind of jumped the shark for me with this episode and the last one, but I'm brave enough to finish it.
>> ARTICLE
As a warning, for Guilty Crown, at episode 13, you might do well to consider it finished and see the rest as a continuation. Its not a bad second half, but I never saw why they continued it. Episode 13 was a good enough ending if they left it that way.
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Katanagatari** and it was good but I feel like most of it's...goodness...stemmed from that last episode. Many of the episodes could reallllyyy drag...and they're 50min. episodes at that. 

The back and forth between Togame and Shichika was great though and that's what I looked forward to the most. Needless to say when [major ending spoilers](/s "Togame gets shot and killed...I was pretty pissed off." )

Remember that the show currently doesn't really have an ending and likely never will get one. If you want to know the end you will have to read the manga, which is also much better as the anime leaves out some important stuff.

Shit. Why no ending? Couldn't fit it all in 12 episodes?

Didn't sell well enough for a second season. The manga is finished though.

Absolutely read the manga if you enjoy the anime. It was the first manga I read, and is really great.

**Shinsekai Yori 25/25** 

Simply put, this was one of the most unique anime experiences I've come across. I personally would say this anime is intended for mature audiences, simply because of the cognitive processing that is required of viewers to make the best out of the anime itself. There's nothing better than a thought provoking anime from time to time.
>> ARTICLE
**Kokoro Connect 1-17(13+Michi Random?)**
Heard a lot of talk about Inaba and this anime during the Best Girl Contest.. Definitely worth watching. [](/s "Am I the only one that wanted Iori to be with Taichi in the end ;-;")

**AnoHana 1-11+Movie**
This is a must watch SoL anime. Some of the characters may seem weird or unlikable at first, but by the end you'll be attached to some (if not all) of them. [](/s "My favourite character was probably "Poppo" if I had to choose one.He tried his hardest to accept that Menma was there even though he doubted the fact himself. He's the kind of friend you could always rely on. Least favourite character would be "Yukiatsu". I'm not sure how everybody else feels about him, but I despise him. Yes, he was in love with Menma and was most likely jealous that she showed up to Jinta and not himself. That doesn't make up for the acts he did to hurt the group. Yes, everybody else thought that Menma wasn't real either and he was the only that actually said it. But he could have done it in many other ways..")

**OreImo Season 1 (15/15)**

Although it did take some willpower to push through the incest-humor concept (I love SOL anime, I love Harem anime, but incest is a bit... iffy :P). After that I really liked it. Good characters, story was alright, can't complain in any way

Rating: 8/10

**OreImo Season 2 (16/16)**

Yeah... Well... Let's split up the ratings:
Episode 1 - 8 (up untill the 22:00 mark): Solid 9/10. I loved the story and the character development in this

Episode 8 (From 22:00 onwards) - Episode 13: Eh, 7/10. Not too bad, always hoping for [Spoiler](/s "Kyousuke x Kuroneko") to happen

Episode 14-16 (Specials): 3/10, tops. Fuck everything about this ending and the way they set this one up. Horrible. Nothing makes sense anymore :/

**Kara no Kyoukai 1-5.5/7**

Took a break halfway through the 5th movie to watch the UBW finale. Honestly I didn't like movie 1 that much, but I stuck with it and the rest have turned out to be pretty amazing. Art and animation are beyond gorgeous, and the soundtrack is amazing as well. I'm getting there, but I still don't really know what's going on.

**Nichijou 1-2/26 (rewatch)**

Not much I can say about this really. Tied for my favourite series ever. One thing I can say is that it doesn't get any less hilarious however many times I rewatch it.

**Selector Infected WIXOSS 1-2/12**

Reserving judgment on this. It does seem interesting. They're really driving home the "psychologically damaging" aspect of the card game. Cute girls as well, which is nice.

**Hanamonogatari 1-5/5**

Beautifully done as always. Kanbaru a qt, [Spoiler](/s "Return of best girl Kaiki was masterfully done"). I question Araragi's sense of style, and the incest humour at the end was a bit forced and unnecessary, but it was great overall. Now I've caught up just in time for Tsuki.

Kara no kyoukai had incredible animation, and that's about it for me. Couldn't understand the plot which was a shame: (

* [**Toradora**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!) - **Completed Re-Watch** - Near the end, a random number of people joined in to watch a few of the episodes around Christmas Time. Myself and the person that was originally watching it with me completed it on the 26th. It was a hell of a lot of fun to enjoy this series again and I always enjoy rewatching things that give me the chance to see the more meaningful foreshadowing and connections to previous points in the series I never really payed attention to before. Overall, it was just a fun series. We both agree that [Potential Spoilers](/s "Ami is Best Girl.")
* [**Fate/Zero**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate/Zero) - **Completed Re-Watch** - Completed this one on Christmas which also had some extra viewers. Was a really good series. My viewing partner for this was really just shocked at how much [](/s "tragedy") there was but he really enjoyed the series quite a bit. We've moved onto watching Fate/Stay Night [Unlimited Blade Works] where I've stopped following it ongoing as I'm going through the early episodes again. We're going to watch episode 5 onwards today. He's really loving the heavy animation and action sequences. There have been times he's asked questions I just couldn't answer since they're related to plot related things so I'm proud of him to actually be watching the series. My greatest worry about showing him these series was that he wouldn't really be paying much attention but he's done really well.

**RahXephon** **15-22**
It's sad when I see this show simply dismissed as a NGE replica, even though the show is it's own thing and well worth a watch, just because they are both psychological-mecha anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you've seen both, which do you think a new viewer should go for first?
>> ARTICLE
NGE is considered one of those must watches, it inspired tropes that are still used today in anime and has a larger fan base so for that reason you may want to try it first but both in my opinion are as good as each other
>> ARTICLE
Would you recommend that to someone who liked the interesting take on mech shows NGE had but heavily disliked the plot (especially at the end)?
>> ARTICLE
In terms of an interesting take on the genre yes, as for the plot I can only really offer you the advice of try it for yourself, it does not deal with the same issues so you don't get as much whiny MC but it is possibly a bit slow. I don't know your reasons for not liking NGE so I can't say for you but NGE used the "plot" as a backdrop for its themes whereas RahXephon focuses on both more so than the other but once again it depends on your reasons for disliking NGE's plot if you will like Rah

Sounds like I might like it. Gonna give it a shot at some point. Cheers

**Fate/Zero (25/25)**

This show is a masterpiece. That's the simplest way I can sum up this anime. The characters, premise, story and overall theme of Fate/Zero was something I can only describe as the closest to perfect anything can possibly get and this anime well deserves the score 10/10 and is now my second favourite anime of all time.

**Hikaru no go**

One piece (627-676)

I honestly do not know how to rate the one piece anime because to me it feels like Toeii animation isnt even bothering at all..
I originally quit the anime at episode 627 when it aired and switched to the manga and thought " even though the speed of things in the anime annoy me ALLOT , doing a marathon should be doable" 

No game no life (12/12) rewatch

Still waiting for the sequal if it is ever happening , the setting is perfect for me , mc is stuck in different world but instead of trying to get back the mc decides to stay .
Had allot of fun even though this is not my first rewatch .

Mushishi (1/26)
First episode but i am really liking it allot , its very relaxing

Nabari no ou (14/26)

Dont really know what to say about this one ,     I feel like it somehow is too early to judge because things seem to be getting interesting

Redline (movie) rewatch

I love this movie , the story , the characters and the setting

Other than this i am thinking about trying out world trigger but i have kind of lost my trust in Toei and the animation looks like them fucking up everything compared to the manga's art ..

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren (12/12)**     
I really enjoyed this season, I of course did feel the same way that most people did who were disappointed by how little development Rikka and Yuta's relationship got, it was still a cute and entertaining anime, a third season would be welcomed.  
**Rating: 8/10**  
    
**Barakamon (12/12)**  
I love SoL anime and Non Non Biyori is one of my favourites, this anime had the same relaxed feeling, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. All the characters were great, and of course Naru was at the top, she took over each scene she was in and filled it with a child-like joy. Though I felt some interactions were a little over the top, it was easy to see past them.

**Little Witch Academia (1/1)**  
Watched this on a whim, since it was only 1 episode, and a really good one at that. I loved the animation style it used, and the characters were great, the visuals were fantastic (especially the 2nd Shiny Arc scene). Can't wait to see more.  
**Rating: 8/10**  
  
**Girls und Panzer (12/12)** (Rewatch)  
I really like this anime, even on the rewatch, there's something really charming about watching a bunch of girls fight each other in tanks, the strategies and tactics used in the show really made it interesting to watch, I can certainly see myself watching this again in the future. There is still a movie yet to be aired that should be fun to watch as well.

I didn't find the monogatari series to be funny per say. It was more like a bunch of excellent dialogue wrapped in a unique and compelling presentation. 

>> ARTICLE
I totally agree I tried watching it. it took me three tries to get past the first episode it was tiring having to pause every other second to read the text. I assumed the show would slow down in pace and give me time to understand and when a joke happened I had to tell myself it was a joke since I didn't find it all that funny. I can appreciate the art style but I cannot enjoy the show with the constant switching of angles it seems too busy and empty at the same time. I can see why its popular but it is not for me.

Lots of its humour lays in word games, if you don't pay attention to Japanese dub or don't know some words to get the jokes, you'll miss whole fun

When I started paying real attention to dub, whole new world emerged

Yeah, I'm aware of that. Most of them I've seen so far have been explained in ep. I know i'm going to miss a lot of the subtle wordplay since my Japanese is below casual.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, Nisio Isin's self-indulgent writing style really isn't for everyone. The humor of the show kind of builds upon itself in a lot of ways though so you might find it more funny as it goes on.

As far as characters go things should pick up by the end of Bake, but there isn't anything *too* impressive until Monogatari Series: Second Season. Whether you want to watch until this point is up to you after you finish Bake.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I get the humour. It's just hit and miss with me.

It's the flash screens and disjointedness that I'm struggling with. I'll hold out because it has it's moments, and the series is that universally praised on this sub that I need to at least get an educated opinion on it.

**Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam - 14/50**

I had watched the original 0079 Gundam series last week and moved onto the sequel, and so far I'm enjoying it even more than 0079. It has a great story so far and darker tone than the original series which I'm digging. Even though it's an 80's show, the animation is really amazing, which was one of the problems I had with the original Gundam. Although some of the cast can be annoying, it doesn't mean they're written badly.

**Aria the Animation - 4/13**

I decided to pick up a slice-of-life show that I was wanting to watch for quite a while now. I wanted something to offset the tense atmosphere of the Zeta Gundam universe. So far, I've found it amazing. The character designs and art are great. Its extremely tranquil, and the main character's personality manages to heal my soul every time. Aria has an interesting world as well.
>> ARTICLE
Zeta Gundam is one of my favorite Gundam series. I was amazed with how well the animation still holds up today. Are you watching all the Gundam series?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I figured I'd watch through all the Gundam series due to my new-found appreciation for mechs.
>> ARTICLE
Have fun ! I completed that undertaking a few years ago. Make sure to watch the side stories as well as the main series. Some of them are really good.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I'm on Zeta Gundam atm too!

I really love the animation and the MC is definitely more realistic than Amuro ever was. The darker tone everyone talks about just feels like regular ol' gundam to me, but maybe that's cause my first gundam series was 00 (ignoring the glimpses of SEED and Wing I saw as a kid) and I had just finished MSG before starting Zeta. As well, these 'annoying characters' seem to be purposely written in, and that shows how far the creators have thought through the plot. Think of them like tests for the main characters :P
>> ARTICLE
**Onegai Teacher**, all 13 episodes.  It was a fun little series, but had some definite downsides.  Being a 2002 anime it's only available in 480p and upscales, and there were a few QUALITY moments.  I liked the character designs a lot better than generic 2010s moeblobs, although given my age that's probably "everything was better when you were twelve" bias leaking through.

fma brother hood 9/10  (64/64)
solid story and solid characters with superb character development. I think it lived up to the excitement having just finshed it I got that feeling only a few shows will give off emptiness after finishing it. This is a feeling equal to when I finished clannad after story and steins gate. I have but one complaint and that is the ending was all satisfactory to me I feel all the main points I wanted were there but some characters didn't get a good conclusion or were made worse off. This was of course a minor detail and this is a very good show that I would recommend. The whole Full metal universe is very well done and explored. If you have not watched it I recommend it. It has funny scenes dramatic scenes and good ol action scenes. with out forcing any of them down your throat.

**Little Witch Academia**

Watched it on Christmas since Trigger posted it on YouTube. It was a great way to kill half an hour. Looking forward to the sequel.

**Fairy Tail (55-70/175)**

More of the same. Still mindless fun.

**I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying (1-13/13)**

The first couple of episodes were hilarious, and the rest of the series was pretty enjoyable. Looking forward to Season 2.

**Toradora! (1-13/25)**

Second time watching this, started during the Christmas rewatch but I fell behind a bit :/ Anyways, the opening arc was adequate and not as great as I had remembered it. *But* after the introduction of Ami-chan (best girl), the series picked back up to the quality that I had felt during my first watch, especially with the Beach House arc and Taiga's father arc.
>> ARTICLE
It's near impossible for me to list what I've watched in the last week because the last few months have been nothing but exercise and anime and I can't really discern what I watched recently from what I've watched last month so I'll just stick with what I'm currently watching.

**SKET Dance (20/77)** 

Even though I have a way to go in the series I am already prepared to recommend this show to other people, I've never seen someone talk about this show before and I have no idea why not. The characters are unique, the episodes range from being realistic to extreme silliness, and the funny is almost always present, now it may be because I prefer to watch a good SoL or Romance anime but this series seems like top quality comedy. My only complaint is sometimes I don't care about the episodes story which brings me from a 10 to a 9 in my rating.

**Final Rating (9/10)**

I've just finished Highschool DxD season 1

First of all, I'm not the biggest fan of ecchi anime, I know they exist in many anime series and many people like it, but it isn't really my cup of tea. I though

I was recommended this anime by some of my friends and started it with low expectations of seeing bunch of fan service done and nothig else. Well, I was wrong. (I have stopped watching this after one episode but my friend told me it gets better after ep 3. So I continued on.)

There are lot of fan service, to it being borderline hentai level (watched uncensored version) but with it, there are fight scenes that I think are really well done. Story it self was very interesting and the way the devils are not viewed as evil being automatically is quite refreshing(?)  to see.

In that regard, I think I'll continue this series, the story is interesting, it has good action scene, and I guess the ecchi part is bonus.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished the last five episodes of Log Horizon S1 today.


I'm not sure how I feel about it... I was initially kind of bothered that I wasn't getting what I thought I signed up for (a SAO knock-off), but when I let go of that idea I started to enjoy it more. It's got a lot of loveable characters, but in the end it feels *just* interesting enough for me to want to pick up the next season. Some of the repeating jokes stopped being funny to me a long time ago.

And shortly after that I started Eureka 7.

BONES is great. I fucking love their art. I'm really looking forward to Naruto and pals go on an adventure. (It's not actually the Naruto VA, but God damn do they sound similar.)

Just finished **Death Note**.

It's been years since I've first saw it. I only remembered the big events but forgot most of the plot. It felt like I was watching it for the first time all over again except I have a greater appreciation for the series this time around. I'm really glad I took the jump and rewatched it. :)

[Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san Episodes 1-12](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22123/Inugami-san_to_Nekoyama-san)

A friend of mine had been wanting me to watch this for a little while now, and I finally got around to watching it. It's nothing really noteworthy. It's short(3-1/2 minute episodes), not much character/plot development, and nothing really happens. It's pretty funny, and really cute. It's not really a must watch series, but I would say pick it up and just watch an episode whenever you have a few minutes to kill. It won't hurt anything.
>> ARTICLE
 holidays prevented me from watching a lot but i think i got a fair amount done. 

**DBZ: battle of Gods**: was a cool dbz that hard it art style massively improved compared to the original series series. The overall plot was really cool with a god of destruction coming to earth. Oh and food man did they emphasize food. felt that the fight were awesome at best and a lot of humor (maybe a little too much).

**Bakemonogatari**: ah i loved this show even though its hard to get. the characters are really thought out and the way they show emotions is awesome. I really want to finish the monogatari series as it is awesome. The way that episode 12 end was really cool as it faded to the stars. Some days i wish as was as popular with the girls as araragi is

**Death Note**: Death Note has been awesome being only 12 episodes in. The amount of caution that L and Light take to prevent things from happen is way epic and tense at the same time. SO tense.

**Hellsing Ultimate** holy crap did the 7^th OVA leave me emotional and weirded the fuck out during one OVA of it. This anime is much more than just vampires and blood. so good.

watched the **K-On!** OVA as well and enjoyed it. cant say much about it as its an OVA. It was fun seeing them at their first concert outside of school.

Rewatching **Steins;Gate** b/c its just such a good anime that i could probably rewatch many times 

couple more episodes of **fairy tail** but the filler arc....

**Hunter x Hunter (59-101/148)**

Took a break shortly before the conclusion of the [](/s "first Phantom Troupe arc") and can't believe how I marathon'd the next two arcs. The [](/s "Chimeria Queen Ant") was nightmare fuel, but fun at the same time. Looking forward to when I'll wander back in to HxH. 

**Cross Game (1-50/50)**

I marathon'd Haikyuu!! last week and was in the market for a new sports anime. I'm glad I stumbled onto Cross Game as it was absolutely amazing. It was a perfect blend of sports cliches, drama, and comedy, and I couldn't stop watching it. It definitely made its way to my top 10. [](/s "The ending of episode 1 came as a complete shock and it was a constant roller coaster ride ever since.") 

9/10, just because I'm very selective with my 10/10s. 

**Sakurasou (21/24)**

It's been a few months since I put Sakurasou on hold. I enjoyed most of it, but I felt that the whole problem with [](/s "people wanting to tear down the dorm") to be unnecessary drama that's dragging the anime on. I know I'm almost at the end but I have no motivation to finish it anytime soon.

Eureka Seven 50/50, for the ump-teenth time.

I watched a season a day starting this week, and oh boy. I still love this show as much as I did the first time I watched it, but this time around was different, because I noticed a lot more little references and a LOT of foreshadowing that there is no way you could pick up on the first few times you watch it. This session also got me lot more emotionally, as usually it only affects me during the 4th season, but I was tearing up nearly every other episode, and then when I usually did. I guess I just forgot how emotional the series was.

11/10^*

**Golden Time (2/24)**

This seems pretty legit, though with the romantic events thus far, I'm both curious and skeptical of where this may go. Guess I'll just have to watch and find out!

**Psycho-Pass 2 (7/11)**

I feel like I should have gotten to this sooner, both because it was just recently airing and because I really enjoyed the first season. Unfortunately, thus far it has not lived up to the OG (although it would be quite a feat if they did), and most of the new characters who were not present in the first season are pretty forgettable. Still has a decent primary plotline though, and I'm a sucker for flawed dystopias.
>> ARTICLE
Cleared my backlog a bit this month.

Ano hana, now one of my favorite anime's of all time, made me cry more than any form of media ever has.

Koutora-san was a bitter sweet series. It was cute and sad and funny. Nothing too spectacular.

Sasami-san was almost great. A few minor problems made it only "good" for me, but good is still good.

Nyaruko, I unfortunately dropped. My highschool self would've enjoyed it years back when it first came out... The humor is just outdated for me. Gratuitous parodies was fresh back then, but its like looking at old memes you're sick of or something.

Haganai was really fun to watch. I'll pray for a season three knowing full well that mg wishes will go unanswered.

Pupa was probably one of the worst anime's I've seen and studio deen continues to pave itself in history as one of the worst anime studios in existence. I could only laugh at how bad it was.

Next I have to go back and finish maoyuu maou yuusha. I have zero expectations of it whatsoever.
>> ARTICLE
**Nagi no Asukara(1-26)**

Hammy at times and did only a decent job of getting me attached to the characters, but it did well with emotional appeal when it really counted. Character arcs were pretty well done, and all of the eventual pairings made good sense. Pretty damn good world building which is important in a fantasy drama, and a decent message to boot. Lacked a bit in thematic delivery because it tried a bit too hard at times, but dramas are dramatic so this was kind of to be expected. Overall a good show and something I'd recommend to anyone who likes these kinds of shows.

Final Score: 7/10

**Tatami Galaxy(2-6)**

Artsy, relatable, quickly becoming one of my favorite anime of all time. It should be noted that I am currently in college so that's probably where a lot of the appeal for this comes from in my perspective. The delivery of Watashi's characterization through his narration is really well handled, and the show does a phenomenal job of presenting itself as something presented from his perspective. Learning about all of his personal biases is really funny and enjoyable, and helps keep me engaged in moments where the show is kind of referencing itself. Examples of this include things like the episodely fortune teller scene. Episode 6 stands out as my favorite so far by a long shot, since [Tatami Galaxy](/s "the personification of Watashi's cock was just downright fucking hilarious, as well as a funny and kind of accurate way of presenting the sexual tension that consumes adolescence and young adulthood. It's name is even Johnny for fucks sake."). Ozu and Higuchi strike me as more than meets the eye, but I'm so caught up in enjoying this show in the moment that I haven't given much thought to where it could be headed. The seemingly romantic subplot is well done as well, and is never intrusive to the show's primary focus.

Eureka 7.

The "Teenagers can do everything and love is the key" theme bugs me as usual...

But it is fun to watch and the OST is out-fucking-standing. A case can also be made that it accurately portrays some mental disorders.

[My favorite example being](/s "When Renton gets a "riders high" and goes ballistic he destroys a mecha so hard that the dude that was inside of it becomes a smeared mess and he sees the victim of his violence for the first time. He quickly devolves into an extreme PTSD state and what's worse is that nobody stops to help him. At the same time they start avoiding him, and he is not only shunned, but completely banned from the one person that might help him regain his mental state. Frankly he couldve committed suicide at that point and it wouldve made sense...")


>> ARTICLE
Completely agree about the OST. One of my top 5 all-time anime soundtracks. I fucking love it. I've listened to the entire thing dozens of times. [This song specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T9Yygju9IY), easily over 250 times. The [Naden remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwhEODguVnA) is really good too.

**Sekai Seifuku**

Decent show that doesn't take itself seriously. Also lolis. The show was pretty enjoyable, if only for the quirky characters and fun art style.The ending sort of hinted at possible sequels, but I'm guessing this show didn't sell like hotcakes looking at the lack of merchandise.


7/10


**Sword Art online**

I'm late to this party, lol. The show was pretty....shounen. The plot as a whole was pretty predictable, especially the latter half. The first 14 episodes were pretty enjoyable because even though it was predictable, the episodic story structure didn't drag on and pack on the artificial suspense/drama too much.[](/s "The latter half of the show was a struggle to watch, honestly. Between the shoe-horned imouto bits and the weird, rapey bits with Asuna, the last 11 episodes kept adding in drama for the sake of drama.")

4/10

**Sunday Without God eps 3/12 re-watch**

I don't know what it says about my tastes in anime, but this show managed to land a 10/10 from me even after a few rewatches. The show's setting/plot isn't the most epic or deep, but the presentation of the show and the characters pretty much leave me bawling every 3 episodes. I really wish this show got more attention, as I would love to have a copy of the LN's, but I can't find a copy of it online anywhere.

The was a neat analysis. I didn't think of those themes while watching the show, but then again, I did watch the show usually past 1 am over the course of 2 nights.

I'll probably give it a rewatch sometime down the line with a bit more seriousness/attention.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same abut sao it felt like I was watching two completely different shows after ep14. I recommend to everyone who asks about this show to stop at ep14 and consider if that ending is good enough for them.
>> ARTICLE
The latter half was just uncomfortable. [] (/s "They inserted Suguha into the mix after the romance between Kirito and Asuna has been pretty much engraved in stone. It pretty much meant that no matter how well they developed Suguha as a character throughout that subplot, no viewer is going to emotionally invest themselves to her since they already know the outcome.")

[](/s "And then the weird, and extremely unnecessary harassment scenes between Sugou and Asuna kind of just left a bitter taste. I can get trying to frame Sugou as a weirdo who's a little off in the head, and to create a sense of urgency/anxiety in the audience to root for Kirito's journey, but it was pretty excessive. The entire plot of ALO and Asuna's capture revolved around the memory/emotion controlling tech that Sugou was developing, and that could have been used to drive the urgency up it a much more tasteful manner. The entire scene where Asuna snuck into the lab with the tentacle scientists was pretty done to drive the rapey factor up to 11 and too make the show seem edgier or more mature without actually accomplishing it.")


That was a bit ranty, but yeah the show was aight.

**Cowboy Bebop**

After finishing Trigun(10/10), I got this on DVD recently since I heard it was really good and better than Space Dandy, which I absolutely love and since it was made by the same dude I decided to give it a try. I'm 6 episodes in so far and... I'm not really feeling it. I mean, the show *oozes* style, and I love the direction it takes both visually and aurally. It has an episodic nature and disjointed plot which I don't mind, plenty of comedies do it just fine (Dandy included), but I'm not really finding Cowboy Bebop funny either. It feels like every episode so far is one of those artsy ones from Space Dandy, like the one with the plant people, that look and sound good but don't seem to provide much else. I'm still pretty early in the series, but I hope it picks up soon either in plot or humor.
>> ARTICLE
**Spice and Wolf (1-26)**

I enjoyed the dichotomy between economics and romance. Kraft and Holo's arguments were sharp and charming, which I felt was the main appeal of the show. The music was also fantastic, especially the first OP. The premise had a lot of potential, but fell short in the end. Certain aspects of the story felt rushed or incomplete. It tugged on my emotional strings a few times, but could have done much more with [](/s "the concept of ageless love.") Maybe this is why
 people keep clamoring for season 3. 

Still a very fun show. **7/10**

**Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo (1/1)**

I'm a fan of Makoto Shinkai and this was one of the last films from him I hadn't seen yet. I didn't like it as much as the other ones. Maybe because it was mainly an adventure anime. But as usual the visuals were superb and screenshots were taken. 7/10

**Mawaru Penguindrum (24/24)**

9-27 (FINISHED) **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann**: To be completely honest, I wasn't intensely liking this show (although I still did like it) much for a really, really long time, to the point where Nia was the only character who I remotely cared about. And then the last episode happened. I still don't know if I should rate it 7 or 8/10, because the last 'arc' was really good but everything else was just okay. 

Since I wasn't really feeling in the mood for binge watching a series, I also watched almost everything from Anime Mirai 2013 and 2014 ([for those uninformed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Animator_Training_Project)). As I expected, **Little Witch Academia** and **Death Billiards** were extremely good, **Harmonie** and **Chronus** were pretty good, **kii Ichinensei to Chiisana Ninensei** was adorable, and the other two were...well, not good. I have all of 2010 and 2011 sitting around, I'm sure I'll get to them eventually.

I'm still not done with **Cowboy Bebop** (watched episodes 20-22). Honestly, at this point it's more because I'm waiting for the movie to arrive at my library rather than me not wanting to watch the rest. Hopefully I finish before holiday break ends.

Finally got started with **Katanagatari.** Not much to say about it at this point, aside from loving the little bit of humor that I saw. I'm honestly kind of confused about what happened in the beginning, but I'm sure that that'll be explained eventually.

Side note: the 2013 re-airing has [a god-tier OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4zvPhzqBZU).

That's pretty much how I felt about Gurren Lagan as well when I watched it recently. The first 8 or so episodes bored me to tears. Until 21 or so it annoyed me in a lot of ways then it finally got actually pretty good in the last arc. I'm not as forgiving as you are about bad starts so I stuck it with a 5. If it wasn't for the good last arc it would have gotten a 3 probably.
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty much exactly how I felt. Honestly, the ending + Nia (Nia is so good) are why I gave it a 7 [the score I ended up deciding on after some thought], although I might downgrade it to a 6 eventually.

**Sakurasou No Pet Na Kanojo***  11/10 Would cry again,But Actually I see it as a 8.5/10 It was pretty underwhelming at the start and near the start,I kinda got bored abit But after those few episodes,Boy...They don't disappoint! I actually felt pretty into it. The story. The music. I loved the characters too,I won't spoil anything if you haven't seen it (I doubt anyone hasn't) But I assure you,The feels will get to you,And for those of us that have,Just want a season 2 and rewatch the entire thing...All in All It gets my exaggerated rating of **9/10**
>> ARTICLE
I was sitting on a 7.5 around episode 20. Was going to drop it to a 7/10 until [Misaki's speech at the ceremony](/spoiler). All the feels. Immediately cemented the 8/10. 
>> ARTICLE
 **Working'!!** (11/13)
This show has made me laugh so much, definitely one of my favorites

**ServantxService** (12/13)
Started kind of slow but after sticking with it I've really enjoyed it and sad that I'm almost done

And **Ouran Host** (3/26)
On the fence about this one, I'll give it a few more episodes but I'm not sure if I'll stick with it

>> ARTICLE
Stick with Ouran. It is one of the comedy greats.
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari** - Amazing characters, an interesting story, and unique visuals. What else could I've been asking for? This show managed to make me stare at my screen with my jaws dropped several times, and in my book that means a 10/10

**Ping Pong: The Animation** - By the end of this list I'll come off as someone who rates shows rather kindly (which I might do, but no to this extent), but these shows have really been exceptional experiences for me. Anyways, Ping Pong. Again, amazing characters, and character developement, and unique visuals, which I actually liked a lot. I think it somehow managed to convey the show better than "normal visuals" would've. 10/10

**Aura: Maryuuinkouga Saigo no Tatakai** - My friend has been nagging me with this for the past ~6 months, and I finally got around watching it, and oh boy did it worth it. Take Rikka and Yuuta (except that this guy is not THAT beta) from Chuuni, and throw them into a somewhat realistic setting, where people with chuuni actually get bullied. This movie conveyed the drama well enough, and the ending was absolutely amazing. 9/10 
>> ARTICLE
I like this weekly thread.

**School Days (9-12/12)**

So I finally finished it. I really don't think it lives up to the hate nor the hype. Maybe it was because I was spoilered, but the ending wasn't as bad as others made it out to be. Overall I found this pretty boring and pretty much just a waste of time.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion**

It's been a while since I watched Evangelion, so I forgot a lot about character dynamics and plot details going into this, which did detract from my experience of this. If I had enough time, I would probably do a rewatch of evangelion and this movie in a shorter time-span to get a better understanding. As it stands thought, this cleared up a lot of the stuff that happened in the last to episodes of the TV show and the end monologue was relatively easier to digest. 

**Rewatch of Hataraku Maou-sama! (8-13/13)**

Oh fuck I love this show. It really picked up at this point, and the battles were hilarious and fun to watch. I definitely feel like it deserves the score that I gave it before. Also I completely forgot about [best girl](/s "Suzuno")

**Btooom! (1-6/13)**

Been watching this before I go to sleep, so I'm not paying too much attention to it, but it's not bad so far. The story actually makes sense, and the character motivations are somewhat reasonable. It feels like a solid show, but not exceptional.

**Baccano! (1-8/13)**

Earlier this week I was planning on marathoning Baccano, but I was interrupted and could only get halfway through. However I do plan to finish it up in the near future. The plot seems pretty intricate and the constant time-skips were/are confusing me, but as the plot is revealed, it's starting to make more sense.

**Recorder to Randoseru Re (1-13/13)**

Fun little short. MUCH better than the first season, because the jokes aren't as repetitive and there's some reasonable development. Not great, but not as bad as season 1.

**The Wind Rises**

Watched it with some friends. Wow, it was pretty great. It had the characteristic ghibli artwork. The story was well shown. The BG was great. Left with a nice feeling at the end. Quality media.

>> ARTICLE
Finished **Katanagatari** and started to rewatch **Bakemonogatari (4/15)** . So, the Nisio Isin week. **Katanagatari** was fucking awesome, the last episode was possibly the best I have ever seen in anime. 10/10, everything was great, action, characters, OST, story, straight to my top 5. [spoiler](/s "Togame's death was freaking sad. And that action sequence, especially Shichika vs Emonzaemon, damn, glorious!")
And then I decided to rewatch **Bakemonogatari**, because I want to watch the whole **Monogatari Series** and I don't remember all the stuff from the first season. And it's even better than what I remember. [](/s "That introduction scene about Araragi's past aka Kizumonogatari is really great.") The last episode was the weakest, but I remember it gets better, especially that episode 12. 
>> ARTICLE
The whole Setokai Yakuindomo Series. The GIFs floating around this sub the last few days gave me a cool insight and inspired me to do so. Fun to watch and made for pervy minds!

To Love-Ru Darkness: I read the original manga when it was in Jump, but I never got invested in the more erotic sequel. After watching it and catching up with it, I can safely say that it is one of the prettiest and more well thought out and endearing harem series. Also, based Rito is ecchi god. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently watching through the Monogatari series; I gotta try catch-up before Tsukimonogatari hits. I'm only 3 episodes in to Bakemonogatari, but I'll hopefully get through it at least close to that time. It's been really enjoyable so far, and I'm interested in where it'll go.

Akame Ga Kill and Nagi no Asukara. Both were amazing, but Nagi no Asukara was unbelievably good. Kind of disappointed in the original ending for Akame (Esdeath fan reporting in) so i'm a tad hopeful it gets an ova remake for those last 5 that are true to the manga so they can continue it, but I doubt it'll happen. Rarely does >.>. Nagi was amazing though, loved it. Reminded me of Anohana, except it didn't give me a vagina and make me wanna curl up with a tub of ice cream.

**Golden Time**

I just finished watching it, is a good romance anime but it has some unnecessary elements like the banri ghost, during the anime I liked that I was confused and didn't know if I wanted koko or rinda to be with banri and after all I liked the ending and the girl Banri choose.

Other then that, I'm trying to get through the 3rd season of Jigoku Shoujo. I loved the 1st season, I liked the 2nd one and I got bored with the formula by now... Nothing really new to get me stick with it for longer than 1episode at the time. **Ep. 8-12**

**Darker Than Black** 

Started this show last week, glad to say i'm currently on episode 7 of s2. I watched the ova in between season 1 and 2 and I think that's why i'm currently enjoying it alot more then most people did at the time of release, although I do have one gripe with s2 and that's that I don't really enjoy Suo all that much. I guess I just miss Huang and Yin, although I already know she's coming up.

Holy fucking shit. That's how I feel right now. If you're 2 years late to the party like I am, and looking for a feel-good anime. THIS IS NOT A FEEL GOOD ANIME. How do I explain it? You finish it and you feel uneasy. You feel unsettled. Your feelings about morality and all that stuff are all over the map. That's how you're meant to feel, and it's so god damn good.

Durarara!! and Fate/Zero and both were amazing! I had started watching F/SN and noticed that I was missing some things so I decided to look up if there was a prequel and found out about Fate/Zero, so I stopped watching F/SN and bingewatched F/Z, which in my opinion is way better than F/SN, probably because the Mage's are older and more mature, this HGW looks like child's play so far.[Fate/Stay Night MAJOR FUTURE SPOILERS](/s "I was suspecting that Archer somehow was Shirou but I didn't know much about the grail, after watching F/Z I had it figured out, couple of help from some critical minor lines and scenes, like the one where his colleague mentions that he was a great Archer but he didn't seem to have any goal when he hit the target.")
Durarara!! was a complete suprise to me, I was kinda disappointed with the first 8 episodes because they were slow-paced but I still decided to give it a shot and boy, was it worth it. Loved all characters especially Shizuo, the man who hates violence, and I was stoked with the main plot [mid-season spoilers](/s "The fact that Mikado was the leader of the Dollars. As for the other two they were kinda expected, I just thought that Mikado was gonna get caught in the middle of it").  The finale was kinda bittersweet [Episode 24](/s "I was completelly heartbroken when Anri told Mikado that she might've liked his best friend when he already had "confessed" to her, they kinda left the whole Mikado/Anri ship unsettled. I loved the Shizuo comeback, that shit was hillarious and the highlight of the anime, and the part where the Dollars beat the crap out of the Yellow Scarves was pretty neat too because it showed that everyone had Mikado's back and they enjoyed being part of the Dollars. ALSO WE SAW SEYMON PUNCHING IZAYA, ALL HAIL THE BIG BLACK RUSSIAN DUDE!") but I really liked the special episode despite being a filler [Episode 25](/s "I really enjoyed the fact that Mikado confessed to Anri on live TV and Celty was amazed by it and thrilled, he finally said that he was happy as a friend but he wanted more than that, and finally Anri reckognized him. Izaya's twin sisters were hillarious, and the good old Izaya-Shizuo fight was really funny too!").  
  
9/10 for both, that's for sure. They both got me hooked, one sooner, the other one later and they stories behind both are really amazing! Super hyped for the 2nd Season first part of Durarara!!

I marathoned Diebuster, sequel to Gunbuster, on Friday. It was fantastic. Once again, based old school studio Gainax manages to keep me interested in its story and characters in 6 episodes more than other studios can in 26. And HOLY SHIT THAT ENDING IS GODTIER.

Also finished One Outs over the weekend. Not bad; I would have liked it better if I was a baseball nut. Decent sports show, kinda slow at times.

Now I'm rewatching Lain so I can wrap my head around it. Because I don't seem to understand...

Blue Exorcist

At first I had my doubts about watching it as it seemed to be a bit cliche (guy finds out he's unique to everyone else but can't tell anyone) but I found myself enjoying it more and more until around ep 17 where they strayed away from the manga. But it was a fun ride 8/10
>> ARTICLE
Kokoro Connect 14 - 17.

It was nice to see best girl actually win.
>> ARTICLE
This past week I binged quite a bit.

**Kokoro Connect**

It was nice to see best girl actually win.  Hell it was nice to see any girl win.  Aside from that it was quite a good anime.  Thumbs up.  Maybe 9/10?  Actually I rather liked it, and would consider it top tier for its genre, so possibly 10.

**Angel Beats**

I originally gave up on it after ep1 because it looked so lame.  After enough people said it wasn't terrible, I got back around to watching it.  Overall I think it was pretty good.  Probably 8 or 9.  I liked the alternate ending better.

**BlazBlue: Alter Memory**

I checked my MAL and wasn't sure if I had watched this or not (hard to distinguish blurry memories of the anime from the game), so I re-watched it.  Decent enough.  Kind of shallow but that's what you get for a VG adaptation.  Still decent because BlazBlue inherently has fairly good story compared to many VGs.  7.

**Shion no Ou**

I remember hearing this wasn't terrible, and the synopsis looked vaguely interesting.  After watching it, I *tut tut* the basic premise.  It's a bit plot-holey, and stretches my suspension of disbelief.  But, overall it was still pretty interesting.  6.

**Zankyou no Terror**

Didn't know what to expect.  Some people said it was good, went unmentioned a lot.  Ended up being *rather good* I think.  Slightly cliche-ey past the initial premise, but still interesting.  The last episode was good [spoiler] (/s "although I don't get why they only sniped 12, as opposed to sniping both or neither; doesn't make sense to me").  I'd give it an 8.

**Selector WIXOSS**

I originally started watching it and ended up putting it on hold after ~ep8.  It was good by that point, but I had other stuff to watch and not enough time.  Got back around to watching the full thing.  Rather good overall although [spoilers] (/s "the ending seems too much of a happy ending for the tone of the entire show").  Still, I think it was strong, so 8/10.

Sidenote: watching Kokoro Connect, Angel Beats, Zankyou no Terror, and WIXOSS in the same week put quite a strain on my soul.  Ugh, I need some feel-good shit after that.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time doing these kind of reviews, but sadly I got somewhat late to the thread due to internet problems.

* **[Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka) - (22/22)**

I fell in love with this anime.  
I've aways been a fan of Slice of Life, and I've always been a fan of quality animation.  
I heard some people talking about Hyouka some times, but I never paid too much attention to it. I knew it was a SoL but that's about everything I knew about Hyouka. Then we got to this year's "Best Girl Contest" and I saw comments like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2fr6na/best_girl_contest_111_you_can_not_cheat_day_26/ckbyazy).  
I...I...wow. "As soon as my vacations start again I'll watch it".   
I watched a couple of episodes and I had already fallen in love with Hyouka. The animation is amazing. The characters looked well done and with a great potential. The SoL part was exactly what I wanted of it. The pacing was kinda slow at first, but I think it helped with the introduction of the characters. But the music...wow. The soundtrack from Hyouka is so good by itself and fits perfectly with the anime. Whenever I hear Bach's Cello Suite N 1 and Air on the G string my heart just melts for this anime.  
Now, there's one thing that Hyouka did perfectly: the Romance. When I started watching the anime, I was kinda scared of it being heavly romance based, since it's not a genre I'm very fond of, but it was SO WELL DONE... It appeared slowly and subtely, as if it was just passing through a couple of episodes, but, by the end, the story was focused on it and I loved every second of it.  
At first I didn't knew what Hyouka was going to be about. Could it be about the mysteries? Well...no. That's like saying K-On! is about music. The mysteries are just a tool used to bring the characters together - and sometimes apart. Hyouka is truly about the interactions between the characters, and it does its job perfectly.  
I never read a Light Novel, but by the end of Hyouka I wanted SO MUCH to read it, but then I found out that the only novel that wasn't adapted to the anime has no translation so far :/  
If you never watched this series, please, please, PLEASE, do me a favor and start it NOW.  
Damn, I'm going to miss Hyouka.

As for the rating, I give Hyouka **10 out of 10** ***Anthologies***.

* **[Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate) - (24/24)**  

Since 2011 I hear people saying how good Steins;Gate is, but for some reason I had never watched it or even looked into it. I thought it was time to give it a try.  
Just let me say one thing first: I had no idea what this anime was about except from the words "Microwave Time Machine". I didn't even know what genre the anime was.  
Alright, started watching it. Being a fan of Slice of Life, I had no problem with the beginning and I thought that the whole anime would be like that. Oh boy, if only I knew how wrong I was...  
Got to [Episode](/s "11"). "Things got a little more serious. Uh oh, what's happening?"  
Got to [Episode](/s "12"). "Well, things seem to be a little better now. Maybe that was just an impress- wait what is going o- wait wh- WHAT."  
Got to [Episode](/s "13"). "Alright, that was a shock. It got a LOT darker, but surely he will fix it using time travel. There, see? He fixe- oh, wait, it's happening again...and again...and...god dammit."  
Jesus Christ, what a rollercoaster that was. I couldn't stop shaking with all the things that were happening when each episode ended. I was watching just 2 or 3 episodes per day until that point, but then I just rushed through everything. I couldn't stop. I thought Okarin would solve [](/s "Mayuri's death") and the plot would move to another thing soon, like a direct confront with SERN or something.  
Everything about this anime was perfect. I got to the point were Okarin [](/s "returned to the beta line") and it looked like it was over. But of course it wasn't.  
I must say I loved almost everything about Steins;Gate, but at the end I got the feeling that everything that happened in those 3 weeks was thrown away for the sake of a happy ending. Yes, I know that's not exactly what happened. I know Okarin remember everything and at least Mayuri remembers her deaths, but it feels wrong, you know?  
There was one thing that I saw in Steins;Gate that I liked a lot btw: The change in the opening when they [](/s "returned to the beta line"). It was still the same music, but with different parts, and the animation was similar but you could see some differences. The lyrics reflected to the changes and I really liked that.  
^(I have yet to watch the OVA and the Movie, but I'll leave that to next year. I need to think about what I watched. I need a break.)

As for the rating, I give Steins;Gate **9 out of 10** ***Future Gadgets***.

* **[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann) - (27/27)**  

Similar to Steins;Gate's case, I always heard that TTGL was a great anime, but never looked into it. I knew it was about mechas and I'm one of those that never into animes about mechas. It was December 23rd and I had already watched everything Christmas-themed that I wanted. Well, let's give TTGL a try, hmm? After Code Geass I thought I should look into some animes with mechas anyway.  
It started a little...weak. Everything seemed to happen because the plot demanded and I couldn't see what the hype was all about. Then I got to [episode](/s "8") and, even with all the flags, [](/s "Kamina's death") got me. From that point up until the [](/s "Spiral King") I was enjoying everything. I thought they would [](/s "lose to the Spiral King since I thought he was the Final Boss"), but nope, I was wrong. Then the [](/s "timeskip") came(I had no idea TTGL had one) and...well, I don't know exactly how I feel about the rest of the anime.  
I didn't quite like that they were getting so many powerups and that the Spiral Power was saving them all the time, but it felt SO GOOD to watch those things happening. Whenever I heard "ROW! ROW! FIGHT THE POWA!" it was a garanteed great scene. When I got to the end and watched a [](/s "giant mecha inside of another giant mecha inside of another giant mecha throwing GALAXIES at another giant mecha") it looked so lame but felt so...amazing.  
Now I see what the hype was all about.  
Also, here we have something similar to Steins;Gate: the opening. After [](/s "Kamina's death") the animation of the opening changed a bit [](/s "to exclude him from it") and after [](/s "the timeskip") both the animation and the part of the music shown were changed.  
^(I have to say I did miss the *"Kimi wa kikoeru? Boku no kono koe ga"* after the change though)

As for the rating, I give Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann **8 out of 10** ***Shuriken Galaxies***.

I also watched:  

* The first 3 episodes of [**Madoka Magica**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica), which I don't have a strong opinion formed yet. I'll rewatch it next month when I come back from the beach with my family and give my opinion on the whole anime.
* [**Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7311/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Shoushitsu), which is one of my favorite animes of all time and I already said some things about [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2pt9b5/haruhi_holiday_rewatch_day_24_final/cn0cxfx)
* The Christmas episodes from [**Lucky Star**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1887/Lucky%E2%98%86Star) and [**K-On!**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On!), which I'll give 10/10 for the sake of Christmas Spirit.

Thanks for reading.

Haikyuu (rewatched) what can I say I absolute love this show, the style of art is amazing, the story writing is amazing the show in general is amazing. I can't really say much cause words can't describe everything for this brilliant show. I can not wait for the Second Season to start! 10/10

Ace of diamonds (caught up to date) I fucking loved it! after watching Haikyuu it go me into a sporting phase. But saying that. The intensity of this show gets me on the edge of my seat especially that last match that Seidou just played. The Characters in the show are well drawn out. The pacing though sometimes it can get a bit to much to handle, but after all that I'm enjoying it. 8/10* I've put an * their because the show hasn't finish yet 

Eyeshield 21 (10 episodes in "first time watching") The Sporting phase is still in lockdown! The show well its not bad. The characters do get a bit annoying at times. The animation for the time that it was done I can handle it but it hasn't aged well. The story line at the moment its a bit Meh, The main character doesn't have a goal to fight for, all he is doing is fighting for the support characters goals. Which is a bit gey to say. But hey I am kinda enjoying it, I am still too early to be judging it and I will finish it. 6/10 for now

Little late here but I'll bite.

I have finished everything listed, including OVAs.


**Oreimo:**

I really liked the show overall, but it had a lot of things that irritated me, especially the ending. Solid 7/10 imo.

**Kokoro Connect:**

Holy molly I have never fallen in love with an anime as quickly as I did this one. I would love for it to get a second season, but sadly that will never happen. 9/10 in my eyes, because I don't give 10/10s.

Im going to start watching Bakemonogatari soon, heard its good. 
>> ARTICLE
I finished **The Eccentric Family**, and I feel kind of weird about it. I never really bought into the premise or the events that were happening, which made me unable to suspend my disbelief during some important dramatic scenes, made me unable to care that much, and made the show less enjoyable than it would have been. On the other hand, when I was able to care, I REALLY cared and it was REALLY good. I thought episodes 5 and 6, for example, were some of best executed and meaningful anime that I've watched in a long time. 

It's strange, there isn't much I disliked about the show. The voice acting is my favourite in a long time. Like, it's been 4 months since I've seen voice acting that good, maybe even longer. It had a logically set up and well executed story with twists that made sense, interesting characters (my favourite was Benten) and great character interactions, and thematic presence. I guess I don't, or rather I can't, think of it as anything less than good, but I struggle to think of it as anything more than that as well. For that it gets a solid **7/10**.

I **LOVED** Uchoten Kazoku.

I think on a story level it was hit or miss, and evidently missed for you. But the art style and characters felt very well fleshed out and vivid. I didn't really see any of the characters as cutouts and the scenes really flourished as a result.

Kaisai was best girl.

I just finished **Spice and Wolf Season 1** and I'll be watching season 2 soon. I found it to be interesting, if a bit tepid. I had a hard time connecting with the characters or world outside of Lawrence and Holo (and Nora toward the end). The sinister twists didn't ultimately feel that tense to me. 

However, the relationship between the two leads is great. The banter and dialogue throughout is really well done, and the dub is awesome too. I love the differences between Lawrence's "Holo" voice and his "business" voice. The music is incredible. I don't think I skipped the OP once. Holo's copious alcohol consumption is also amazing. :P

I think it's good, but not spectacular. It's something I would recommend based on the person, but probably not in general. 

Now, onto season 2!

**Fairy Tail 70-73/175**

Ugh, this show. More of the same; Natsu's an idiot, Erza's OP as fuck, and Happy is pretty goddamn annoying. Ai! *cringes*

Pretty short arc this time around, I hope it stays that way. Otherwise, I'll probs drop it. 
**Juvia's pretty hot/10**

**Ping Pong The Animation 11/11 Rewatch**

AWWWWW YEAH! Goddamnit man, *this fucking show*

It's climbed up to the #2 spot in my top 10 list (sorry Bebop)

I'm not going into too much detail this marvelous show, as other people have said 1000 things in the past a 1000 times better, but I'll just say it's pretty fucking good. **10/10**

**Guilty Crown 22/22 + Stupid OVA**

**[Hatsukoi Limited](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5150)**

It follows a group of junior-high girls at the start of their romantic lives. Sure, nothing really major goes on. It's just a lot of brief one-episode arcs that don't start to come together into a coherent story until the 7th episode, giving it an almost omnibus feel to it. Yet after the Christmas episode, it became a nice coherent whole that will satisfy anyone who loves sappy romance anime. 

Score: 7/10  
Recommendation level: Have you fallen in love today?  

[**The Wings of Honneamise**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1034)

I'm sort of conflicted here. On the one hand, it was a product of the Cold War: international conflict on a global scale, the game of politics, huge operations run on shoestring budgets... On the other hand, it was a product of the Cold War that doesn't exactly work *beyond* the Cold War. Unless you've ever joked with friends about how you jump up whenever you see a bright flash of light so that the shadow of your body would make a neat pattern on the wall just in case that was a nuclear detonation behind you, I don't think that the subtext of Honneamise would actually get through to you. 

It was powerful in the 80s. In the 2010s, it's a relic of a bygone age.  

Score: 7/10  
Recommendation Level: History buffs and old people.  

[**Colorful**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8142)  

I'd heard wonderful things about this movie in the past, and how it was life-changing and reaffirming and all that wonderful stuff. Unfortunately, I just didn't see that part. The story was certainly compelling and wonderful but, as someone who has dealt with depression and suicide, the main thrust of the story was cheesy and contrived and full of signs that showed me that the director had absolutely no idea what was really going on. 

It was still a very good movie, even with the directorial flub. But it wasn't the best thing ever.

Score: 8/10  
Recommendation Level: People who wonder what it's like to commit suicide while having no intention of ever doing so.  

[**Gunbuster 2: Diebuster**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1002)

After a bunch of serious things, I needed something brainless and action-filled to kind of let my brain relax for a while. (Plus the events of Christmas Eve really made me want to watch random shit blow up, but that's just personal stuff leaking in to my anime habit again.) And what's better for brainless action than the 20th anniversary sequel of Gainax's great Gunbuster?

Story-wise, Diebuster was a lot better than Gunbuster. There weren't a lot of "LOL WTF JAPAN" moments here, with a coherent plot and actual character development almost across the board while not simply pulling things out of the ass for the sake of pulling things out of the ass. Yet action-wise, it wasn't nearly as hectic and balls-to-the-wall insane as Gunbuster; even the craziest of action sequences was, in comparison to other anime, just another day at the office. 

It's still a fun way to spend three hours. And even though it wasn't as quantitatively over-the-top as Gunbuster, Diebuster has a more cohesive whole than its parent story. So of the two, I'd have to give the edge to Diebuster.  

Score: 8/10  
Recommendation Level: If you love giant robots, you need to watch both of these OVAs. Now.

Quiet week for me, though I did get to finish three series that were currently airing.

Hataraku Maou-sama (The Devil is a Part-Timer): 8. Hilarious all around, even during the tense fight scenes.

Non Non Biyori: 8. Weekly dose of diabetes. The countryside setting amplifies how relaxing slice-of-life can be.

Watching right now: Mirai Nikki (10/26), Sakura Trick (1/12), The World God Only Knows (3/12), Aldonah Zero (0/12), Evangelion Rebuild (0/3).

I am watching my first anime, Cowboy Bebop. It is an incredible experience. The characters are all so well done, the setting is fantastic and begs to be further explored, the episodic story lines are generally well done and engaging, and the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever come across for anything. All in all, 10/10 so far. I just finished episode 16, "Black Dog Serenade," which was an interesting view into Jet's past. Can't wait to continue watching over these next couple of weeks!

Oh wow, starting with one of the classics! Although it is one of the most friendly classic anime.

 It's a great ride that only gets better and better until it concludes with a beautiful ending, though be careful as a lot of plot details can be missed if you're not carefull and a lot of it's underlying themes are hard to figure out for yourself.

Hope you enjoy !

Quite liking **[Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3002/Gyakkyou_Burai_Kaiji:_Ultimate_Survivor)** so far. I have watched 19 of the 26 episodes  and it has been effective at creating tension and has done a fairly effective job at developing the main character so far. Additionally I quite like the animation style and ED theme of the show.

Hah! I started watching this as well, though I am on episode 11. 

Pretty good overall but I do feel like the show is padded out a little more than I like (reactions being drawn out every time, long explanations of how every trick works...)

Really? I thought that part 2 of season 2 was the weakest, mainly because [s2 spoilers](/s "the bog arc was way too long, it was satisfying to see Kaiji finally win, but god damn that arc was hard to get through.")
>> ARTICLE
The first half of season 2 was more...sped up if that's the term I'm looking for. Alot went on and the plot moved at a good pace. The stakes also felt higher to me. Kaiji also wasn't as naive as he was in season 1 and acted way more badass imo (the white gloves were a great addition to his character design too).

The last half of season 2 though was almost a Kaiji version of "Endless Eight". The episodes weren't bad but you could tell that the writers wanted to end the anime at a certain point and had to extend the bog to get there.

But I loved both season 1 and 2. Both great shows!

**Haibane Renmei episodes 8-13**

Beautiful. Not really sure what else to say, but this show is the first that has made me cry in half a year or so. There wasn't anything bombastic or in your face about the drama, but the quietness and subtlety of the show, along with its beautiful soundtrack kind of spoke for itself. When it worked (and it often did), it worked like magic.

It handled its mystery elements fantastically, as I was always left guessing at what was going on and how things would turn out. Though I'm still confused about stuff regarding the wall, like why [](/s "Rakka had to wear the suit while doing her job") and a few other things.

Rakka and Reki have become two of my favourite characters, and the way things played out between them in the final episode was, dare I say, perfect. I was going to put a spoiler tag and say my favourite moments from the episode, but I think I'd just be describing the whole finale.

4 episodes really stand out for me: the first one with [](/s "Rakka's wings coming through") being one of the most memorable scenes from the show, [](/s "Kuu's passing"), and the last two with [](/s "the fireworks and stuff with Hyouko, and the entire character climax between Rakka and Reki in the last episode") being where most of the waterworks came from. 

Great show. I recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet and contemplative mystery/SoL/drama. I'm giving it a **9/10**, and I'd love to watch it again some day. It seems like something with solid rewatch value.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, the more I read about this show, the more similarities I see between this and [Sora no Woto](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To), which I *loved*. I should really get around to watching this.

I'd say definitely give it a shot. You'll know if you'll like it if you check out the first two episodes.

**Mobile Suit Gundam (43/43)**

This got sooo much better near the end. I found the themes it dealt with very similar to Code Geass, but it felt like it was handled in a much more mature way. I can't believe the amount of misinformation spread about this show. It doesn't focus on the mechas anymore than NGE, CG, Gurren Lagann or A/Z. It focuses on the characters a lot. It does a very good job at making the Zeons look just as bad as good as the Federation. Char is absolutely amazing and I can't wait to see more of him. Ending was great. Some of the bigger battles genuinely felt like cooardinated military battles and that was probably one of my favourite parts of the show.

While it started off pretty slow due to a lot of filler and other things, this honestly was a really enjoyable show to watch. Consider me  a fan of Universal Century Gundam from now on. **9/10**

**Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team (2/12)**

Seems interesting so far. Love the mecha designs. Artstyle is great so far, very nice and clean looking. Can't believe this was 1995. Can't really comment on it too much so far, but one thing has me confused. Why is there multiple Gundams down on Earth in combat? I thought the RX-78-2 was special in that it was the only Gundam utilised in the OYW? I know Guntanks were mass-produced anyway but not Gundams. Why wasn't there any up during the battle of A Baoa Qu? I only saw GM units and Balls there. I assume it has something to do with the Core Block system, or just that RX-78-2 was the only one suited for space combat.

**Gundam the Origin: Blue Eyed Casval**

Woah! This was brilliant! This honestly made me like 0079 even more, since it gives insight to Char and Sayla's backstory. Loved the CGI in this, didn't feel out of place like A/Z in my opinion. Can't wait for #2. Is this considered canon to UC? I've heard conflicting reports. 

Loved this little movie. **9/10**, just like 0079.

**Little Witch Academia**

D'aww! This was adorable and great. Absolutely charming. Animation was amazing and it was just so vibrant! Wish there was more. Character designs, music, everything in this was great. Liked this much more than the other Trigger work I've seen, KLK.

I'd have to give this one an **8/10** personally. Can't wait for the second one.

**Inferno Cop (12/12)**

This was... very interesting. Trigger never ceases to just dumbfound me. This is honestly unlike anything I've ever seen before. The humour was honestly right up my alley. Interesting little webseries nontheless. ~~**7/10**~~ **10/10 Literally the greatest thing I've ever seen**
>> ARTICLE
In regards to the 08th MS Team, I the Gundam units were created using spare parts during the production of RX 78-2 since the Federation didn't want to just waste them. Read about it on this [wiki.](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-79%EF%BC%BBG%EF%BC%BD_Gundam_Ground_Type) 

The Origin OVA was based off of the manga which was created by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, one of character designers who worked on 0079. It retells the story of the older animation with some changes such as the addition of Char and Sayla's backstory. As far as the Gundam franchise is concerned, anything animated can be considered canon.

**Cross Game (1-50/50)**

This was amazing. It had a beautiful first episode. The characters were very good. The baseball was an interesting setting for the story. It even ended perfectly. I marathoned all 50 episodes over 3 days. 10/10 in my books.

**Kyoukai no Kanata (1-12/12)**

Hmm. I'm not really sure what I can point to that is wrong with this show. I liked the characters and their interactions, the plot was interesting, the animation was beautiful. Even the ending, which some felt was a cop-out, was fine with me. They had already done the "bad" ending 2 episodes prior, and it would have been wrong to simply repeat it.

But I don't know, I'm just not enthusiastic about the show. My immediate reaction after finishing was to give it 7/10. It's just missing something--maybe "fun", maybe "style"--that it needed.

**Oreshura (1-2/13)**

Looks to be a harem-ish comedy. But the main girl so far is delightfully cruel, and is blackmailing the MC, which is rather amusing. But then she's cruel to the childhood friend, which is a little excessive. It's like kicking a puppy.

**Kurenai (1-5/12)**

This show is fairly weird. I picked it up after a [WT] thread. I'm not sure what's going on, but the relationship between the bodyguard and the young girl he's protecting is very sweet.

It's kind of like Usagi Drop, but with a lot more violence.
>> ARTICLE
Totally with you about Kyoukai no Kanata. It was beautiful to look at and had all these great elements - but it never really got to the point where it grabbed me. Normally KyoAni characters manage to instantly charm me and make me care about them but it just didn't happen. My guess is on the mix of moe-comedy and supernatural action that refused to click with each other but I'm not sure.

**Animatrix**, an anime with 9 parts all of which made by different people with only connection being theme around the Matrix movies. Very *interesting* animation styles. I liked the first and [8th](https://gfycat.com/GlumBlindGuineafowl) but everything else was just meh.

**Toradora! - 25/25**

I've seen plenty of anime with romance elements, but this was my first real "romance anime" (i.e. the romance is the center of the plot rather than a by-product of it). I'm glad I started with something as amazing as Toradora. Great cast, great music, great character development. The ending was quite beautiful in the way that they [spoilers](/s "call back to the beginning of the series with the Tiger/Dragon parallels, the "There's something in this world..." speech, and Ryuuji finding Taiga in the same place he met her for the 1st time").  I also can't talk about Toradora! without mentioning how much I love the 2nd ED songOrange. You like cool ED song transitions? You'll love how they use Orange. Also the way the song relates to the characters hits me in the feels every time.

Taiga quickly went from "is she a tsundere or just a bitch?" to one of my favorite characters. Her interactions with Ryuuji ended up just as fun to watch as Holo and Lawrence from S&W. While Ryuuji is probably not a groundbreaking character or anything, he was relateable, funny, and overall great guy. The other 3 main characters were commendable. Not once did they feel like they were just "there". They were important to the development of the main couple while also being standouts in their own ways.

Finally, I didn't expect much from Toradora! when I started it, but by the end, it had soared so high past my expectations I had to include it in my Top 5 Favorites. This was a great experience and I can't wait to rewatch it in December with you guys!
 
**Hyouka - 7/22**

This has been on my huge Plan-to-Watch list the longest. It's interesting so far. The visuals are what brought me to the show, but I was pleasantly surprised by the sound design and what that brought to the table. I especially like Chitanda's design and how they use her PIERCING AMETHYST EYES against Oreki. How could you say no to that face? Hyouka also sports quite the Voice Acting cast. Many of my favorites, as well as people who previously worked with KyoAni (hell, the entire Hokago Teatime is in Hyouka) are in abundance. Looking forward to seeing more now that I'm on spring break.

EDIT:

**Madoka Magica Rebellion - Rewatch**

On the bus ride home from college yesterday, I decided to rewatch Rebellion. Man, there's so much to this film that you just don't catch the first time around. I absolutely think it requires at least two viewings to fully appreciate it now. With that said, I'm sure no one would disagree with me when I say that Rebellion is a VISUAL AND AUDIO MASTERPIECE. Seriously, this movie flexes its guns (aka budget) when it comes to the animations. You thought the series had cool trippy witch sequences? They don't hold a candle to Rebellion. You thought Yuki Kajiura was great in the series? She absolutely DOMINATES here. The big point of contention with Rebellion is always the ending. First time around, I was a bit on the fence about it. This time, I realized I am with it all the way. Could it have been done better? Yeah, for sure. Was it a satisfying conclusion? For many of you, no. For me? Honestly, yes.
It didn't give me that melancholic bittersweet feeling that the show did. The ending to Rebellion was more like, "Wow, that just happened. That was...kind of cool. Wow?" And it had just enough to it that I didn't really think I needed to see more (although I'm totally for more Madoka). Plus, the ending credits and post-credit scene were awesome ways to top it all off.

After my rewatch, I just could not in good conscious keep it at the same rating as the show. Madoka Magica is amazing, but Rebellion Story takes the cake here.

**White album 2 (5/12)**

**OnegaiTeacher**

What we have here is a fairly typical example of the ecchi romance drama genre. We have a weird premise (MC-kun has rare disease), a lack of direct parenting (aunt and uncle instead), and an odd plot (alien lands directly in MC-kun's life for no apparent reason). We have a secret admirer, a long-time overprotective friend of the secret admirer, the overexcited friend of the MC, and a gaggle of associated hangers-on to fill out a scene. All of the stereotypical boxes on the checklist have been marked, so you should know exactly what you're getting.

And you get it. In full. 

OnegaiTeacher delivers exactly what it is supposed to. It has a few twists that aren't common at all that can set it aside from the pack, but it is still imminently recognizable as being an ecchi romance anime. 

What it does better than expected, however, was in some of the allegedly generic characters. Kei is not a simple self-insert-fantasy MC, with a personality that is distinctly his own. The secret admirer doesn't simply lay down and accept her fate blithely, but struggles onward. The overprotective friend has her own little twist, although entirely predictable in hindsight. And, even more importantly, the side characters are shown to have lives and relationships that do not depend entirely on the presence of the main characters. 

For those factors, OnegaiTeacher sets itself a bit above the normal generic ecchi romance. Not by much, mind you, but a bit.

Score: 7/10  
Recommendation Level: People who want a bit of kissing in their ecchi.

**Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuuusha de Aru**

Tell you what... Why don't I just copy-pasta my notes from while I was watching it. 

* Episode 1: Holy shitballs, but that was never 23 minutes just now. Are you sure they didn't accidentally cut a few minutes from the stream? Nope. It really did kick off that amazingly well. 
* Episode 2: Oh yeah, wheelchair girl! You go! [](/s "Although I do have to wonder why she has three of those little helper spirits while everyone else only has one... Shades of Homura coming to haunt my memory? Or actual premonition?") Also, too: World's Best Sister to Fu for letting Itsuki have half the pudding... that was already Itsuki's to begin with.
* Episode 3: Ah, yes. The good old "New girl is too serious about everything" switcheroo... Also, too: Wow but that was a great subbing job. Crunchyroll really dipped into their roots as a fansub company for this one.
* Episode 4: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just going to spend an hour or so attempting to interpret the method behind Itsuki's tarot spread. You just keep watching without me. (What? Don't blame me... My dad was the one that was interested in all this stuff. I just got it all by osmosis.)
* Episode 5: That esclated quickly. Very quickly. Almost a TTGL-style quickly. Which leads me to a comparison. If Madoka is to Evangelion for the sake of deconstruction of a popular genre, the perhaps YuYuYu is to TTGL with over-the-top determination and escalation beyond the norm? Probably getting it wrong, of course. But for the first five episodes, that's what I've been feeling. Plus, the known big bad is already down. What are they going to do for the remaining seven episodes?
* Episode 6: Well. That's a different route than I was expecting. It's rare that an anime shows the lasting effects of having to do all of these battles. I wonder how it will turn out in the end... although that last line by Yuuna makes my skin crawl with dread. "We have plenty of time!" is not a sentence that is uttered lightly in this kind of title.
* Episode 7: Aaaaaaaaaaand the traditional beach trip, complete with a stay at an inn. But the interplay between the characters is so well written that I have absolutely zero problem with this. Also, too: Hell of a cliffhanger there at the end.
* Episode 8: Methinks there's not going to be an end to the battles. And, after looking at that girl on the bed, I think this is merely the start of the feels parade. Oi, but what a thing to be confronted with...
* Episode 9: Just... Just shut up and let me sit here and cry for a while. 'Kay? I'll be good in a bit. 
* Episode 10: First half? Kinda fun little flashbacks to the beginning of it all. The middle? Ye fucking gods. The actual fuck did *that* come from?!? Second half? Yeah. Shit got real, yo. And... here... we... go.
* Episode 11: Dammit, dude. Stop typing these notes at the end of each episode! IT'S SHOWTIME, BITCHES!
* Episode 12: I can't even think any more; would sob again. Also, too: "Yuki Yuna's Chapter"?!? Was that a hint of things to come? If so, I can't think of anything else I would rather see more than... YuYuYu 2!

That's pretty much how I do these things while watcing. A little peek under the hood, if you will. Was that interesting to anyone else? Probably not. But from that brief little set of notes, I can pull just about anything else out of my memories and shove them into these long and rambling reviews.

Score: 9/10  
Recommendation Level: Yes. Simply yes. Absolutely yes.

**No Game No Life**

Okay. Fine. Whatever. People kept yelling and screaming and hyping about this anime for the *past year*. So I figured it was finally time for an old man to see what all the hubbub was about. 

I was mildly underwhelmed.

I felt absolutely zero connection to the characters. Sora is two-dimensional at best, with the tendency to monologue excessively about his intelligence being his most prominent trait. Shiro doesn't even have that additional dimension, being completely bland and uninspired. Jibril is exceptionally inconsistent in her personality, switching between modes at the lightest of topic changes. The side characters are either filler or mere placeholders. The only one with anything resembling full characterization is Stephanie, yet she is used more for comedic relief than substantial plot movement. (Although she does have a significant amount of *PLOT* to move...)

The story itself is fairly interesting once the characters get out of the way. With generally consistent worldbuilding and interesting detail given to the games, it occasionally became fun to watch. Likewise, the art and animation were typically stellar for a MadHouse production. As was, for that matter, a particularly awesome opening.

And then we come to the cliffhanger ending, which is where NGNL drops yet again. I loathe these types of finales that serve solely as bait for the manga/LN/VN or as a teaser for a second season that probably will never happen. I want a resolution of some sort for the final episode, where the various plot threads are brought to a decent stop, rather than some grandiose end scene that tells you how much more awesome things could get later on... 

If they ever bother to do anything later on. If a series is planned to continue, such as a split-cour or a confirmed second season, that would be one thing. But to just stop cold when the show is just starting to kick into high gear is one of the biggest faults I can find in an anime. Why? Because I'm not watching the manga. I'm not watching the light novel. I'm not watching the visual novel. I'm watching the anime. And for judging the anime as itself, the continuing source material has absolutely zero bearing on my thoughts and might as well not even exist. 

(I'm looking directly at you, people who say "Oh, but the romance in Spice And Wolf is much more obvious in the rest of the light novels!" If it's not in the anime, it doesn't matter for the scoring of the anime.)

NGNL reminded me of another MadHouse production: Btooom! Excessive monologuing, genius-level MCs that love to talk about how amazing they are, random *PLOT* moments, and completely unresolved cliffhanger endings are just a few of the comparisons between the two titles. And seeing how much I hated Btooom!, for a show to remind me so clearly of it is a definite mark against it.

Score: 6/10  
Recommendation Level: Anyone under the age of 20 would love it. Anyone over the age of 30 would probably have the same reaction as I did.

**Tamako Market + Tamako Love Story** 

Everyone told me tamako market wasn't very good, and it's better to just watch love story on it's own. I say, screw that. Tamako market was a great pick me up. It's light and fluffy like all moe blobs, but there's actually some plot happening here! ... Okay so the plot isn't much, and it's not super original or anything, but it does add a little something to the otherwise standard moe show.

Then I moved on to the movie everyone loves and the ending everyone loves and... GAAAAAH! [Spoiler rant](/s "I AM 12 EPISODES AND A MOVIE INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! DON'T JUST CUT TO BLACK WITH A CONFESSION, I NEED MORE!! I was ready to BURST with how much build up it had (keep in mind I finished the entire tamako market series just beforehand) and all I get is a confession in a black screen?! C'MON KYOANI, WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME! Give me MOOOOOOORE! I want to see mochizou grab tamako with tears of joy! I want to hear him promise to come back when he finishes university! I want to hear tamako say she will wait for him! Anything! Just give me something more!! PLEASE!")

spoiler summary: KyoAni, y u do dis to me.
>> ARTICLE
While, yeah, I'll admit it might not have been as viscerally satisfying in its raw romance, I thought the ending to Tamako Love Story was actually really fitting! It felt pretty appropriate to me to never see much of the love, because the awkward confession itself felt like such a beautifully heartfelt cumulation of everything the movie wanted to say. There's too many things going on - too many things changing - as you're moving away from your adolescent prime, but goddamn just reaching out and embracing that fleetingness of youth might as well be the first step in changing the world. 

[](/s "Oh and I think the black screen was also really appropriate because it cuts the visuals away so you are focusing on nothing but the words of her confession, but that's just a minor aside from me.")

...But I also sorta kinda played that scene like six times and cried every time so I'll admit I'm a little biased.


>> ARTICLE
thanks for your reply to me elsewhere, it was either the subs being incorrect or me not reading carefully!

as for the ending, [](/s "Half of me agrees with you and half of me really loves abrupt endings like that. I think that given that the movie was only like 75 minutes long, we could have used an extra scene after the confession, let me describe it: Tamako's dad's song is playing and it shows everyone in the market being all cheerful and doing their thing, and then it ends by showing Tamako and Mochizou smiling at each other or holding hands or something, and then credits. That would be ideal I think, just the right amount of cheesiness.")
>> ARTICLE
[might as well tag the whole thing](/s "I dunno, I feel like they built up the university thing a lot and then ends without addressing the fact that mochizou is leaving the market. I feel like they should at least acknowledge that he is, indeed, leaving, and that he and tamako should resolve that before we cut to credits. ")

Also, [those](/s "black screens") in the final scene. KyoAni you mother fucker. I love you and I hate you so much. So. Much.

I've spent a week watching anime's that are based on economics in one form or another. 

**C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control**

I really liked what this anime was trying to say with its story!
It is highly unfortunate that this show was limited to only 11 episodes, as C had a lot of great ideas but suffered from time constraints. [C spoilers](/s "Does Yoga lose his future? Will Mysu or what she represents ever be a reality? It isn't quite clear if he was left with anything in the end of this")

The morality issues of money that the series focuses on was brilliant. It truly got a point across, but did suffer from the age-old cliche of "both are right but have different solutions and cannot agree" thing. Oh well. Good show overall.

**Spice and Wolf [Ookami to Koushinryou]**

Well its technically economy based, being about trading and all. With me being a hopeless romantic; I found this show really enjoyable. The ending to it? Well.. [Ookami to Koushinryou spoilers](/s "I kind of wanted him to end up with at least some fair amount of money at the end, but instead Lawrence trades off everything in order to buy back Holo(Horo). The romance part of the show was the focus, however, and it really did have an excellent payoff at the end. I heard of the ending for the novel series (including the epilogue)") 

In the end, I am convinced to read the light novels, because this show only covers a few books from the series, and I am wanting to get to the conclusion of the romantics.

Spice and Wolf was the better of the two, in my opinion. I think they should finish the series in anime format.

Ooh, I really liked **C** back when I first watched it. I was thinking of picking up **Spice and Wolf** since there's a rewatch going on currently. Looks like I will!

**Full Metal Panic Episode 13:**

This episode was much more "light" in tone, and it seems that next episode is going to be more comic as well? Or was it supposed to be comical? We've had the "You don't understand me!" bit between two of the characters, and I did feel it was pretty heavy-handed when one of the characters literally said she was only pushing the other character so they'd admit they can't handle things on their own and turn to others for help, before imploding. I suspect we'll get some lighter episodes before returning to more serious business, or there wouldn't be cause for continuity as in The Second Raid.

**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso / Your Lie in April Episodes 1-5:**

I planned to catch up to this show before it ended, but forgot that it's a NoitaminA show, which means only 22 episodes, so I got caught off guard. Then I wanted to marathon it. People on Twitter told me it's very atmospheric and thus hard to marathon, and indeed, I don't think I can watch more than 3-5 episodes of it at once. Is it because of how atmospheric it is, because of how dramatic, and even *melodramatic* it is? Perhaps, but it's also because of how annoyed I am when I watch this show, pissed off at times even.

*I find this show morally reprehensible.*

Sounds extreme? But I truly *feel* that way. These 5 episodes, if I had to find their theme, it'd be "narcissism", and since this narcissism is made manifest in a way that quashes under foot not just someone else's feelings, but their *depression*? It feels so wrong. There's the comical level everything is blamed on the spineless MC by the tsundere, that's the light level when the characters are drawn in a deformed manner that tells us we're in joke mode, but when we snap out of it, that's still what we have.

Multiple characters keep telling Kousei to "just snap out of it," that they are pushing him out of his comfort zone, and into a situation where he feels helpless "for his own good," but it's because they want something out of him, they need his music, they want to hear him, or they want to see him happy, but they'll destroy him for his "happiness", because then they'd feel good about it. They'd tell him whatever they need, they put him on a pedestal, and in so doing slash at the living person.

And then, in an entirely anime manner, after [episode 4 spoiler](/s "Kaori collapses"), and because this is what you do in these shows as a joke, Kousei blames himself for it, and for her not making it. It's all his fault. But then when we snap out of the deformed joke mode, we're still there. We're still blaming Kousei who was strong armed, who relived his trauma, and had a new one right there on stage, because someone else wanted him to play, because someone else wanted to help him how they thought was good.

I mean, the characters are 14, and they're clueless about these things, so I'm not going to call them morally reprehensible, any more than most such children can be, in a thoughtless manner, not out of cruelty. But the show should know better, and is selling Kousei's situation as the butt of jokes, and his "friends'" actions as the right thing to do, and it's revolting to watch.

On the production level, this show is absolutely beautiful, not because of its animation, but in spite of it. The backgrounds often remind me of Makoto Shinkai, and some of the show's themes do too. The show has 40-50 second sequences with nothing but panning crowds. The characters look somewhat strange as they move, because they are moved as cardboard pieces, rigidly, rather than actually changing their position or form.

And this is something I grew to notice after Saekano, also produced by A-1 studios - the show keeps showing us half faces, nose and above, or mouth and below. This robs emotional scenes from much of their weight, and is done so the show wouldn't have to actually animate facial expressions ([see Bahamut: Genesis](http://i.imgur.com/9LaW82d.gif) for [some actually drawn sequence](http://i.imgur.com/2lrqEIS.gif)), to do the hard work. Heck, we even have a couple of sequences in episode 5 where models move past one another as if it were Kill la Kill.

There are a lot of places where the animation cuts corners. The show still looks great, because the backgrounds are lush, and the character models are sharp, and there are some animation going on. But when you cut down to it, it doesn't look all that different from say, Log Horizon 2nd season in terms of many scenes' animation, it's just that the models look sharp and there are backgrounds, whereas Log Horizon cut them all at once. That the show looks good, and that the direction helps it, by playing to its strength, makes it easy to overlook.

I've had people tell me that it's better than most shows. It might be, but that the rest looks good actually draws my attention more to all the areas where it lacks, because they stand out. And even if it were better than most shows, it doesn't necessarily mean it's good, merely that the standard is exceedingly low. There's a reason there's so much room to go from anime series to movies, in terms of effort put into animation.

And to reiterate, it's a great looking show, but the animation is distractingly bad. I think I'll keep watching, but man, with how unpalatable I find the constant narcissism and depression-related messages, I might drop it at some point, soon. It's like watching Welcome to the NHK, but that one was hard to watch because how much it *understood* and empathized, and this show is the exact opposite.

(Planned to watch more stuff after, but KimiUso sorta soured my mood on anime over the weekend.)
>> ARTICLE
>Full Metal Panic!

Yeah, next episode is light-hearted. There's only like two other light-hearted episodes after that, the rest is darker storyline stuff. There's a three-parter coming up for you that I personally found infuriating for a few (spoilery) reasons.

But the final arc was pretty good, probably the best part of FMP.
>> ARTICLE
I think the one thing KimiUso did poorly at the beginning of the show was failing to emphasize just how long Kousei had been "colorless". The way I read it, Kousei had been "lost" for two years, and his friends were getting desperate, and thus being a little excessive in their methods to get him back to normal.

But in the show, he's really only colorless for the first part of one episode, so it feels like his friends are greatly over-reacting.

In some respects it's comparable to Hyouka, only Oreki spent a much larger time in his first state, and the transition was more gradual. Which I think made the viewer appreciate it more.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that would've made a material difference. A reason does not make a justification.

I understand Kousei's friends, even if I think they're actually self-servingly narcissistic, as is only reasonable for 14 year olds who hadn't suffered from depression themselves.

I get what they're doing. But the show is presenting it as The Right Thing, and even if Kousei had spent 9 episodes colourless, I'd have still found his "friends'" actions thereafter, and the show's depiction of them reprehensible, if understandable.

**Chuunibyou demo koi ga Shitai (12/12)** 

This was my first real moe KyoAni anime and oh my god I don't think I've ever aww'd and hnng'd in my life watching any show. This show was absolutely adorable and I loved watching it. I actually really liked the plot as well with Rikka [S1 Spoiler](/s "coming to terms with accepting her fathers death."). But my absolute favourite part in terms of the plot was the fact that Rikka's chuunibyou [S1 Spoiler](/s "was due to her being inspired by Yuuta as an escape mechanism away from reality rather than just being a self-defense mechanism. Although they did amount to the same thing of her running away from accepting reality, it really did tie their eventual relationship together, which I found was really nice. Speaking of relationship, I absolutely adored Yuuta and Rikkas eventual relationship and never found it forced or anything of the sort. To me it seemed to flow naturally and was just right.")

**Chuunibyou demo koi ga Shitai Ren (12/12)** 

For this sequel I knew what I was getting into and was somewhat prepared for it to be worse than the first season. And while I do think that in terms of plot, it was much weaker than the first, I still very much enjoyed watching Ren. 

The slice of life episodes were okay but since I still find Chu2byo to be the most adorable anime ever I still enjoyed watching it. I know most people hated the fact that Rikka somewhat regressed back into her heavy chuunibyou and that [slight spoiler](/s "her love relationship with Yuuta is INCREDIBLY slow paced.") I still liked watching it. TBH, while their relationship progressed at a snail's pace, I do understand why it was so slow and I can accept it. 

Plus they did have their moments, mainly the [Mega S2 spoiler?](/s "kiss on the cheek that made me squeal out like a little girl.") But the end was [Ep 12 spoiler](/s "such a fucking tease that I smacked my table when it happened. "). Even then, I still liked watching Ren and I hope for a third season.

  
**Toaru Kagaku no Railgun (24/24)**

If I can sum up this series, it would be holy shit Misaka is a fucking badass. This is my first entry the Raildex universe and right from the get go of [Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UjRT1BF05k) I knew that I was going to like the series. And for the most part, Railgun delivered pretty well on those expectations. 

The first 12 episodes of the first arc were pretty great IMO. I thought that while the plot and main villain of the first arc were rather cliche, they were well written for the most part. The second half however was kinda meh, due to the heavy amount of slice of life episodes which I thought are the weakest part of the series. In fact, anything that focused on Saten or Uiharu was pretty meh and definitely the low points of the series. Even the villain of the last arc was just laughable. The highlights however, were Misaka's badassness and Kuroko's antics. Anytime they were on screen it was fun to watch. 

What I especially enjoyed was the interesting way Misaka uses her powers such as climbing walls that had a somewhat scientific basis. This reminded me of Mahouka which I also enjoyed watching/reading that had a heavy scientific basis for magic.  

More than anything else, this series got my excited and motivated to keep watching the Raildex universe, which I am currently doing.

**Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S (24/24)**

I am truly at a lost for words with regards to this. The entire Sister's arc was so *amazing* in my opinion. I can't fully describe why I enjoyed watching it, but it made me marathon through basically the entire series all the way up to episode 18 within 2 days which I rarely do during school term, especially with having a test that was a couple days later. 

Everything about it was so good that I went to try to convince other people to watch Railgun just so they can watch Railgun S. IMO Railgun S was superior in every way to Railgun. It had amazing fight scenes, great new characters in the form of the Sisters, Accelerator and Touma as well (having not watched Index yet) and absolutely stellar growth for Misaka, which carried on all the way to the final episode of the series. Watching her internal struggle with trying to solve of trying to solve everything by herself [Railgun S spoilers](/s "and failing which ultimately leads to her relying on others was just so enticing for me to watch."). I didn't know what to expect when people said that Railgun S was the best of the franchise, but after watching it myself the Sister's Arc definitely qualifies as one of the top anime arcs I've ever watched.  
>> ARTICLE
Loved Railgun when I watched it, it's what got me started into watching more anime. The sisters arc is really amazing but I'm happy the entire series isn't like that tbh. I enjoy the SoL moments and lighter side to the series. Happy to hear you enjoyed it :D
>> ARTICLE
>  I still very much enjoyed watching Ren.

I sometimes describe Ren as a show where I enjoyed almost every episode (sans the competitive sleeping one, and the finale), and yet didn't enjoy, or like, the show as a whole. Series composition is important, and when half your episodes are thinly-veiled OVA/filler material, in a 12 episode run, it's bad business.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair Chuu2Koi as a whole is filler, the whole series is essentially all original in comparison to the novels.
>> ARTICLE
I meant "filler" more in the "doesn't progress the plot" meaning here, and yes, I'm aware of that.

I mean, that Dekomori and Nibutani episode, which I loved, and the sleeping competition episode, they were clearly there to hold off on the actual plot, and also broke the plot's pacing up, which was doubly unfortunate, even if the Deko x Nibutani episode was brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
That was my point because they went all original KyoAni could do whatever they wanted which resulted in filler/ova tier episodes.

Those parts plus the Sophia parts were the best.

Essentially Deko x Nibutani progressed more than Yuuta x Rika.
>> ARTICLE
> Essentially Deko x Nibutani progressed more than Yuuta x Rika.

It didn't. I remember back during my notes for that episode, I was a bit sad over Nibutani and Deko not progressing, but then noted, "But that is the nature of comic relief duos such as these, they are not allowed to progress, as that will impinge on their role."

The sad realization is when you realize that RomCom characters aren't allowed to progress either, as the relationship happening is the end-point of most such shows, rather than the start.

tl;dr - They advanced the same amount, but seeing as Yuuta x Rikka is the *point* of the show, this was such a damn shame...

And yes, the part where Sophia [spoiler for Chu2koi Ren](/s "cried") was the highlight of the season. But when you look at how little time she had on the show., it's just so sad.

KyoAni's problem to me recently is one of writing. They just don't know how to write good content, so if they have good source material, they should avoid changing it. It's good that it seems with Amagi and the upcoming Euphonium they're going back to this route, of trusting authors' works.
>> ARTICLE
At least [Deko x Nibutani](/s "actually kissed") even if it was for comedy. But yeah thinking back you're quite right about the lack of progress on both sides.

I'm also glad they're going away from totally changing the source material.
Though is it really due to lack of faith in the material? As the plot of the books is far superior to what KyoAni wrote.
 
Sophia was indeed my favourite cast member of Ren it's just saddening that she wasn't really an integral part of the season when it was quite the opposite in the books. 
>> ARTICLE
> Though is it really due to lack of faith in the material?

Even if that's not their reasoning, that's what it signifies. Free! took the LN and used it as backstory, Kyoukai no Kanata changed the tone of the work entirely, and then Chu2koi. Changing those works means they don't really respecting them. There's changing some stuff to make it fit better for the show, and then there are changes so big that you need to squint to see the original.

It'd be as if Gollum replaced Gandalf :P
>> ARTICLE
Would you recommend reading the novels? If they are pretty different from how season 2 unfolded I'm kinda interested.  
>> ARTICLE
Haven't read them *yet*, but read *of* them. They're quite different. I mean, Kumin isn't very plot-relevant, but Dekomori that gets quite some screen time, and even Touka, are all anime-original characters.

Even if most of the content in the books appears in the anime, the overall effect plays out quite differently. Again, going by what I'm told, but considering the amount of anime-original content, it can't be helped.
>> ARTICLE
Yea I think I read that Deko and Touka were anime original and that was hard for me to believe since they felt like they fit right into the story. They had to have changed something to have worked those characters in though. I'm getting more curious now.
>> ARTICLE
Touka is mostly there to tell us truths we could either read in character's thoughts, or would have to understand for our own. Dekomori's "important to the story scenes" are mostly there for Yuuta to say out loud content that in the book we'd see in his thoughts, or would realize he's thinking/feeling without him saying them out loud.

So I'm not sure. But the feeling would be so very different without Touka's flying ladle, that's for sure ;-)

I'll prolly read it at some point, but I'm taking a break from LNs for actual novels these days.

**[Kill la Kill](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18679/Kill_la_Kill) (7-24/24)**  
9/10. This was really fun to watch, I liked it a lot. The character designs were really sweet, Ryuko looks too cool. It didn't quite live up to TTGL but not many shows are as good as that so that's alright. I don't know about this show "saving anime" but it was a really great watch.

**[Tamako Market](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16417/Tamako_Market) (1-12/12)**  
6.5/10. The bird Dera was grinding my gears pretty much throughout the whole series, and a lot of it wasn't really believable. I mean I don't watch anime because it's believable, it's just a lot of the events in this show just seemed really out of the blue and convenient. But I gotta say, Kyo-ani really knows how to make adorable characters, Anko was too cute. I pretty much just watched this so I could watch Tamako Love Story though, so I wasn't expecting too much. It was pretty nice!

**[Tamako Love Story](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21647/Tamako_Love_Story)**  
8/10. This is pretty much exactly what I wanted Tamako Market to be. Cute and touching. If you want a nice cute high school romance flick, definitely check this out. It's not *essential* that you see the series first but it might enhance the experience. I do have a question about the movie though if anyone can answer for me: [](/s "Why did Tamako tell Midori she gave Mochizou a proper reply? It never showed it and I'm too dumb to figure out what was implied.")

**[FLCL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/227/FLCL) (1-6/6)**  
7.5/10. This was really fun to watch, and I liked that you had to figure out what was going on and fill in the holes. I think episode 3 was my favorite, [Ninamori](http://konachan.com/image/e3f0bdbdb33a6631c54052247e069b68/Konachan.com%20-%2041659%20flcl%20glasses%20ninamori_eri%20vector.jpg) is a really cool character and I wish we saw more of her, but that's alright.

**[Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21405/Bokura_wa_Minna_Kawaisou) (1-12/12)**  
7/10. When I started watching this I was like "Ritsu's pretty cute" but couldn't quite put my finger on why and then I realized that Kana Hanazawa did her voice <3. As I continued watching, I realized that Ritsu pretty much carried this show for me, everyone else was pretty annoying. I really hate when characters are so one-dimensional (e.g. Shiro being masochistic), but I guess it's a little harder to prevent that in a 12-episode show. A little cheesy too but in general I was pleased.

Discussion thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2zt64y/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_262265/).

Thoughts on the first five seasons [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ycp4n/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cp8a296).

Relatively small installment, but we get a few solid arcs in preparation for the "Final Chapter" movie. "Final". We get more information on the Joi Rebellion. The anime gets taken hostage and replaced with another show whose opening monologue can be summarized as "Once upon a time everyones dick fell off except mine so now my harem is 6 billion strong". We laugh when facing misfortune and hardship. We peep on a fantastic expression of love. We take back the whole god damn nation. And half of it is set to the tune of [Sakura Mitsutsuki](https://vimeo.com/82499330). Good stuff.

###[Eiken](http://myanimelist.net/anime/788) (1-2/2)

Not really much to say despite its notoriety. Unapologetically trashy. I dont think theres any fifteen second interval without [an ass wiggling in your face](http://i.imgur.com/qzKIWsL.gif) or [monstrously-oversized tits flopping around uncontrollably]( http://i.imgur.com/z5ALZGu.gif). On some level there is satire and self-awareness at work. Kiriko *does* lampshade the entirety of the show after a fortune teller lays out the unambitious story for us. Ahoges are as oversized as the chests. The [school uniforms](http://i.imgur.com/70HhcXt.gif) feel like they were designed to be as gaudy as possible. Character ticks couldnt be more overt - Kiriko and Yuriko [smothered](http://i.imgur.com/eV90561.gif) poor Densuke so often that Im surprised he didnt suffocate at some point. All of that considered, holding up a mirror with the worst ecchi-harem conventions blankly on display and exaggerated for comedy isnt something I would call *good* or *interesting* satire. I mean, theres not really any statement being made *about* those conventions nor does the narrative overcome them at any point. So, yeah, not much to discuss really.

Surprisingly decent in animation, though there were a few instances of "a line is being delivered to another character with no lip movement". Most of the attention was given to the T&A. A few cuts were repeated for laughs. No damning hiccups, but nothing worth noting.

There wasnt much by way of romance, humor, or (effective) titillation, but I never felt strongly one way or the other for my lack of interest. Eiken just kind of bounced off of me without leaving a mark.

Oh my god this ran for **eighteen** volumes in its manga form? Kind of hard to imagine that someone made their living from this property for a few years. I almost want to check out [Jinsei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23121) for that fact alone.

**All links possibly NSFW**

[From Hollow of Dawns shitlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1yDVa43Huc). I have a bad habit of pouncing on something that gets no mercy from a critic that I follow. Itsuten is far from "the worst anime that I have ever fucking seen", but I did find myself agreeing with a lot of his points.

A fantasy-adventure where endless worlds are linked by way of rifts and connected to the Holy Grounds, a room in a high school where the guardians that comprise the student council deal with demons that enter our world. Where power is granted through contracts and magic-wielding. Where a vampire possibly tied to the destruction of our world simply seeks solace in [the boy she fell for](http://i.imgur.com/Wor0wBl.gif). Where he, her servant made conditionally immortal, finds himself thrown into the fray. Where the military and "The Church" monitor the supernatural and oversee the developments of "The Prophecy".

The variables for Itsutens story are fairly straightforward, and, if handled correctly, *could* have made for a fun show. It has boundless new worlds to explore. It has a system of magic and spells bolstered through familiars and trade specialties. It has organizational politics and bids for influence over high stakes. In spite of that foundation, nothing seems to come together in a compelling way. The structure of the show has little focus. [Composition Spoilers](/s "Our main force of antagonism is disposed of in the first arc before we meddle around in possession, training, a love-triangle with the hapless childhood friend, NTR, and a bath house"). A concept, character, or plot point will be introduced to layer the story without giving it much explanation. There is a common refrain of:

\- "Who are you? / "What do you mean?" / "What is {x}?" / "Why are you doing this?"	
\- "You dont need to know." / "The time has not yet come." / "{Cryptic answer excluding the audience from receiving information}"

With its variables vaguely defined, its hard to say that the show forms any ideas worth discussing. [Taito desires strength](http://i.imgur.com/XtG1P.gif) to protect whats important to him as that will lead him and others to happiness. Himea overcomes the worst of trials through her love, but that love is bound to an expression poorly-crafted at best. Gekkou is driven by his brother to be strong; his hidden compassionate side leads him to accept that strength is magnified by others and that cloistering yourself limits that potential. [Episode 7](/s "Strength can come at a price. You cant always fight by force toward your goals. Sometimes sacrifice is necessary to advance. Do our ambitions line up with the needs and wants of others?") Not really exciting stuff in my bookand that was felt in the characters as well. I never felt any reason to like Himea nor did I buy into the sense of danger or tragedy in her relationship with Taito. Gekkous putdowns got old quick. 

Where the show excels is in its [expressive use of color](http://i.imgur.com/8KgOGzu.jpg) with reds and oranges clashing against blues and purples to build its otherworldly feel. Each rift leads to a dimension with a lush personality. [Warm and enveloping](https://33.media.tumblr.com/097b87027560159e336a9f53e12fadfb/tumblr_mg0icecThN1s0kwxdo2_500.gif) in some instances, [cold and distant](http://i99.beon.ru/25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lo2wj6UJS81qg2kzko1_500.gif) in others. The supernatural [transforms](http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/35200000/-Kawaii-Itsuka-Tenma-no-Kuro-Usagi-kawaii-anime-35243469-500-283.gif) the Holy Grounds when it intrudes where otherwise a [calming](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5q1v9SJ9C1qe39a1o1_500.gif) and [bright](http://i.imgur.com/ufDwNWp.gif) palette dominates.

Nothing really on the side of direction or animation. Surprisingly consistent with no noticeable drops in quality. Fights could have been handled better. [The camera](http://i.imgur.com/69s6j.gif) likes to stay in close range and that doesnt do any favors when trying to make sense of the sparring.

Silly but fun ride that leaves you wanting to know more about the story:

* [](/s "Who is Lil / Lir? What is her relation to Cross and the military?")
* [](/s "What is The Prophecy? Is it tied to the Rapture spell cast in the possession episode?")
* [](/s "What is The Church? What are their objectives? Why are they framed as an oppositional force in relation to the military?")
* [](/s "How is Hinata still alive? What form has he taken? What is he setting out to do?")
* [](/s "What significance does Aomi have? She seemed to have an ability to sense the supernatural and responded very casually to it during her first on-camera encounter with it.")

[PV](http://www.crunchyroll.com/a-dark-rabbit-has-seven-lives/a-dark-rabbit-has-seven-lives-official-preview-580796)  Courtesy of CrunchyRoll. The English voiceover is hilarious.

[OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCFux6oynh4)  Naked, crying, underwater loli female lead, dichotomous childhood friend, and battle poses. The sequence matches the energy of the track well enough and it gives you a sense of how any other-dimensional world is characterized by its color.

[ED 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtgInYihfLA)  In love with this track and its chanting, call-and-response lead-ins with heavy use of vocal effects, and build-up to its chorus. While some of the imagery lies beyond what was explained in the show, whats shown is arguably its best asset: the color work and its infatuation with fantasy worlds, all tied to the character bound to that element.
	
[ED 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCW01JpohlA)  Alright, chibi Andou is admittedly adorable.
	
Itsuten is a goddamn mess, but theres probably a decent story in there somewhere. If you can overlook its deficiencies and are a fan of fantasy-adventure that isnt light on the [ecchi](https://33.media.tumblr.com/4fd58edc6a780ab08aacea548c750180/tumblr_miqfenRARR1qjn3rno1_500.gif) or [lolis](https://38.media.tumblr.com/8aba74c73c64586e1b5a29f699962986/tumblr_mioyexJ6YB1qjn3rno1_r1_500.gif), youll likely find something enjoyable here.

Wow, the awful then not-good-but-not-terrible-enough-to-rant-about-the-week 1-2 show combo. How do you get through these things? I doubt I would've made it halfway through either of the two first episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
**Oregairu** I have to say this show is different.... and I like it. Hachiman's words, while sounding almost stereotypically pretentious/adolescent-deep, actually ring a lot of truth. The characters are likable and it's pretty bizarre to see so many of the actual people I know being represented by anime characters with their ideals. 

And while I know the anime is poking fun at the whole romcom genre, I really want Hachiman x Yukino happening sometime >_< 

**Angel Beats** 
Dang, quite the feels ride indeed especially episode 10 (I think it was this one). Even though the few amount of episodes rushed things, for the timeframe it was pretty well done. Suffers from the "too many characters to care about" syndrome but the MCs make up for that. 

>> ARTICLE
**Glasslip, finished**

From all the circlejerking I expected some bullshit twist, as in the worst ending ever complete with time-slips and/ or guillotine gorillas whose feelings are fragments of glass and once the guillotine gorilla feelings trapped in the glasses of glasses girl join the lights of the meteor shower everything will resolve itself in the most nonsensical way, queue slideshow of happy pairings, the end.

[Unspecific Glasslip Spoiler](/s "But this was worse. I feel betrayed not only by this anime but also by all the people saying it would be terrible.  This is the end of all plots, the end of all messages, the end of all character developement, the end of entertainment.") If anyone knows the "Neverending Story", Glasslip is what eats up that world.

**Pupa, finished**

Watched the uncensored version and if anyone else is planning on watching this to check off one more legendarily bad anime I advise to do the same as it reveals how badly done the gore is. At the point of episode 6 I was whishing for it to be porn. Putting aside that I've yet to see good horror in anime, a 4-minute format doesn't help in creating a dark atmosphere. It works decent as a trashy experience to ridicule though.

**Kemono no Souja Erin, ep. 32**

I'm really liking this anime. Some events in the first part were incredibly touching. For a childrens show it certainly doesn't shy away from depicting a cruel reality, but it stays true to its target audience by keeping things simple - and that kind of reduction works so well with its messages and depth. Very, very beautiful. And the opening song is absolutely amazing.

**Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu, ep. 6**

I started my road through this epic and am really liking it. I was afraid it would go over the top with a vast universe and fry my brain with more characters than I could ever be bothered to care about, but so far it's really good at avoiding this issue and making it easy on the viewer. The style is great and I enjoy not having to look at spaceships shooting each other for minutes (it focuses on the fate of the crew or battle-strategy instead). Also KircheisxReinhard OTP. When the ED didn't play at the end of ep 7 I had to go to youtube and watch it there because I missed it.

**Akame ga Kill, ep 9**

Dear god why. I've read some things about it and thought it'd be horrible and after it beat Nagi no Asukara in the favourite anime contest I wanted to confirm. And I confirmed. I thought it wanted to depict [](/s "killing as something meaningful and real") in the first episode, but dear god was I wrong. It wants nothing. Except maybe sell figures of the harem cast. This is one of the most laughable shounen I've seen since Fairytale, like a school-project where teenagers combine ideas from their favourite shows but something went terribly wrong and it became an anime no one could possibly need and got unleashed into this world. I'll continue watching in the hope that [](/s "every singly one of these unbearable paper-cuts die and in the end Akame's sister sacrificing herself for her- no! Akame sacrificing herself for her sister who then has a change of heart. Esdeath realizes something about humans or life or the universe and kills the prime-minister and marries the king. In between some more killing and dying that means absolutely nothing. I want to spectate as this show deliberately runs over the cliff, shatters in the abyss and then drills its way into a magma chamber.")

**[Hanasaku Iroha](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9289/Hanasaku_Iroha)** (1-3/26)  
I started this today and I can't tell yet if I like it or not. The whole situation is infuriating. 

**[Kanon (2006)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1530/Kanon_(2006))** (1-24/24)  
I watched Clannad (but not yet Afterstory) and saw a recommendation for this. I think I may have liked this more than Clannad, and I definitely cried more. I really like the character of the MC of this and Clannad, that jokey, pranky type.

**[Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai (Unbreakable Machine-Doll)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17247/Machine-Doll_wa_Kizutsukanai)** (1-12/12)  
Another generic light novel battle school harem. I still enjoy this type of thing though, but in the end I didn't find myself invested in the story at all.

**Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai Specials** (1-6/6)  
Some ecchi specials. Nothing really worth noting except that unlike a lot of these these specials tried to tie themselves together with a theme and subplot about the nature of magic and spirits. A nice touch but I didn't really understand what they were getting at.

**[Hidan no Aria](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8630/Hidan_no_Aria)** (1-12/12)  
An interesting premise but I found it a bit repetitive. 

**Hidan no Aria Special** (1/1)  
A decent special. Nothing much to say about it.

**[Mashiroiro Symphony: The Color of Lovers](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10397/Mashiroiro_Symphony:_The_Color_of_Lovers)** (1-12)  
This was a lot of fun and a lot of drama. [Spoilers](/s "it's refreshing to watch a high school slice of life harem anime with a definitive romantic conclusion.")

**Mashiroiro Symphony: The Color of Lovers Picture Drama** (1-2/2)

**Mashiroiro Symphony: Airi ga Anata no Kanojo ni!?** (1/1)  
Kind of creepy.

**[Black Bullet](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20787/Black_Bullet)** (1-13/13)  
The only thing I knew about this going in was that I had seen an image of a guy covered in laughing lolis. This is full of surprises. It's hard to to fully describe without getting into spoilers, but its tone and themes aren't what you expect going in. I'd recommend it if you can get past the young girls.

**Isshuukan Friends. Specials** (1-12/12)  
Short entries from Kaori's diary. A nice addition to the anime.

**Corpse Party** (1-4/4)  
I heard many times that this is the goriest anime around, and was left disappointed. To me it's a one trick pony - "look at these intestines, isn't it gross?"

**[Zetsuen no Tempest](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest)** (1-24/24)  
Really, really good. It good incredibly tedious in the lead up to the half way point, but that is the only flaw I noticed.

**[Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (My Little Monster)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14227/Tonari_no_Kaibutsu-kun)** (1-13/13)
I've been half way done with this for over a year. Finally watched it start to finish. I wasn't missing much, the last few episodes are more of the same. Still fun though.

**Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun: Tonari no Gokudou-kun** (1/1)  
...Interesting, but odd and largely redundant.

I missed last week's thread so if you don't mind here is my last week too.

**[Toradora!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!)** (1-25/25)  
I had been meaning to keep up with the Christmas rewatch but I stopped after 2 episodes. I'm glad I came back. Overall a great show, that stumbled a little in my opinion with the ending. From what I heard, the ending to the light novel made more sense, [spoilers](/s "because rather from leaving for more than a year apparently with no contact, she left for six weeks, and was back for the start of their senior year.")

**Toradora!: Bentou no Gokui** (1/1)  
Average. Watched for the sake of completion.

**Toradora!: SOS!** (1-4/4)  
Struggled to get through this for the sake of completion.

**[Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/849/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu)** (1-28/28 plus movie)  
This was a lot of fun, I don't know why it took me so long to watch it. The movie was so hyped up I felt a little disappointed. It was entertaining, and well animated, but from what everyone said to me I expected to get my mind blown. I'm looking forward to the spin off. Endless Eight was interesting. I thought it wasn't going to get bored because I was still okay by episode 3, but it really dragged on. I'm a little disappointed we never got to see any [spoilers](/s "day repeating humour such as predicting events to your advantage or freaking people out. I wonder what happened on the two days Nagato said they didn't go to the festival, I think she might have gone postal. I felt really bad for her the whole time, I was expecting a mental breakdown at any moment, having the exact same conversation and answering the same questions 15000 times.")

**[Isshuukan Friends.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21327/Isshuukan_Friends.)** (1-12/12)  
I started this last year and forgot about it. It's a really sweet story.

**Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (53-64/64)**

What a ride its been. In total, due to my slow anime-watching pace, it took me over two months to watch this in its entirety. While I haven't been FMAB's biggest fan in my past reviews, I will emphatically admit that it's ending is fantastic. It wrapped up every character's end perfectly, although just a little too perfect for my personal tastes. I think that the animation was great especially in those last 4 episodes and I truly will miss these characters.

Regarding the series as a whole, it started out on a fantastic high note. It's premise, tormented characters, and engaging OST immediately grasped the viewer. The first OP and ED are probably some of the more memorable ones from the series. Unfortunately, the series did suffer from pacing issues following the immediate start. One aspect of praise was the show's occasional grimness and I wish it had followed a more serious path rather than its shounen path. I found the show to be very entertaining but it also has very awkward transitions from serious plot to comedic shounen moments. Towards the later half of the series, the plot got kind of convoluted and many of the character motivations/actions were a bit off.

I also didn't enjoy the character designs much. For instance, I think the character design of Rose was atrocious and I feel that Envy, Mustang and Hawkeye's character designs are also lacking. In total, its truly the base character designs that I dislike due to their extremely round heads, and poorly drawn hair.

In total, I feel that FMAB is a good series that just happens to be interspersed with great moments and not the other way around. Entertaining? Yea. Deserving of its spot on MAL? No. Still, fun series and worth the 64 episodes. **8/10**

EDIT: **Katanagatari (4-6/13)**

This is a very good series. After the first 2 episodes, I got used to the very heavy dialogue driven episodes. The animation, choreography, and character designs are all spectacular. The little nuances that are implemented into the writing like Shichika's use of "However by that time you will be already torn to pieces" and the physical closeness between Shichika & Togame never fail to make me genuinely smile while watching. I love the boldness and confidence in the writing and I think that it shows through the blatant reveal that [spoilers](/s "Shichika will have to kill his sister in the next episode"). In episode 6, seeing [spoilers](/s "the little girl have to deal with her bitter loneliness after her village was wiped out") was pretty emotional. Other highlights include [spoilers](/s "episode 4 where Shichika's sister brutally murders the 3 maniwani, and in episode 5 when Shichika gets jealous for the sake of togame.") Heartfelt, touching, (sometimes even jaw-dropping) moments like these are rare in a series, and Katanagatari is accomplished enough to earn these at least once an episode. Can't wait to finish this series up in the next week. **8/10**

Oh sure, in my subjective opinion, if you're looking for an amazing SOL show, **Barakamon** is fantastic. It's not just a shallow run-of-the-mill SOL, instead it has amazing character development, great VAs, hilarious comedy, and a relaxing tone.

If you're into romance, **White Album 2** has great drama, complex characters, and a great OST as well. (If you like movies, **Hotarubi no Mori e** is a romantic short-film thats only 45 min long. One of my personal top 3 movies.)

For comedies, **Nichijou** is a must. Stunning animation, and hilarious comedy, and although occasionally it can be hit-or-miss, this subreddit  (and myself included) generally accept it as one of the funniest anime out there.

If you like sports anime, **Ping Pong the Animation** is a must. At first glance, the animation will make you turn away in disgust but you'll get used to its intentional style by the first episode. Id personally categorize this as more of a character-study anime with ping pong as its backdrop. With the realistic setting where not everyone can win, Ping Pong the Animation asks heavy questions like "what does it mean to be successful? Winning? Happiness? Status? Achievements?"

If you like well-animated action shows, the recent **Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works** is up your alley. Its the prequel to Fate/Zero, and while in my opinion its shallower than Fate/Zero in terms of themes, it is still very entertaining. 

Hopefully that helps! This list ended up a little longer than expected but just some miscellaneous movies that I think are fantastic are **Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away** if you ever find yourself in the mood for a movie

Thanks, this is really cool of you

I interested as to how you felt FMA:B to be convoluted as I have never heard that complaint before. I do agree with you about the comedy though.
>> ARTICLE
I felt that after the halfway mark of the series, when the core group was separated after the Northern Wall battle, FMAB started to spread itself a little too thin. The plot started moving much faster than it had before, and it also started to introduce (relatively) a lot of new characters to the group. This was the primary cause of my saying that the plot was convoluted, because at one point, the narrative was following an enormous amount of subplots and groups: the splintered Homunculi, Roy Mustang, all of Mustang's compatriots, Ed Greed and the Chimeras, Alphonse Scar May, Pride, etc. I thought that there were too many moving pieces of the puzzle (which may have been partially intended by the writers) but the significance of it was that the very complex plot covered holes in the character motivations. [spoiler](/s "Roy Mustang snaps on Envy despite there being little to no foreshadowing that he was extremely unstable in his quest for revenge. The chimeras had little reason to fight with the group after getting away from Kimblee.") However, I definitely don't think that this ruined the show or anything. Just a minor gripe

**[Nisekoi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18897/Nisekoi) (1-20/20) (+OVAs)**

Anyone else preparing for Season 2? I really love Shafts works and wasn't disappointed with Nisekoi. The camera angles, the faces, the head tilts, ahhh it was all there. I really feel the Shaft visuals carried the show through and made it very enjoyable to watch. Best show of nothing happening haha, looking forward to season 2!

**[Seitokai no Ichizon](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=5909) (Student Council's Discretion) (1-12/12)**

**[Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10464/Seitokai_no_Ichizon_Lv.2) (Student Council's Discretion Level 2) (1-10/10)**

Holy crap why does no one talk about this show? It was one of the most hilarious harem comedies I've seen. Ken is one of the most likable harem leads I've watched, very similar to Ayumu from Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka. The girls were all very likable too and I ended up loving pretty much every single character in the show. The references to other anime were hilarious and the interactions between the cast was spot on. I watched the show on a whim and fully enjoyed it, again very surprised I've never seen it mentioned. 8/10 show.

**[Zankyou No Terror](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror) (Terror in Resonance) (1-11/11)**

Was an alright show. I was expecting more "All according to plan" antics and thought it was going to be more of a mindgame show, and it was for the first 3 or 4 episodes. But once it shafted the main detective to the side and introduced Five it seemed to lose its direction to me. Wasn't a bad show for what it is. 
>> ARTICLE
I also thought that Nisekoi was a very, very average harem/anime that was completely and utterly carried to the realm of 'decent watch' by SHAFT.

The direction of the series was excellent, even if the story and lack of anything of any substance happening, ever, held it back as a whole.

[**K-On!! \(7-26/26) + Specials**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7791/K-On!!)

[**K-On! Movie**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=9617)

How to say it, this series just works. Watching high school girls eating cake and drinking tea. I guess the appeal is in the unrelenting optimism, and ofc the moe aspect. Also I found the music to be pretty decent, no rice no life. For the movie I liked how they actually did the English correctly (for the brits), rather than the infamous engrish.

K-on!! - Rank 12 (10/10

K-on! Movie - Rank 8 (10/10)

[**Nisekoi (1/20)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=18897)

Basically Toradora, at least that's my first impression of it. Raku is a pretty standard kid despite his background, Chitoge is an abusive tsundere, Onadere is the nice girl who never speaks up (because if she did the series would've have ended by the first episode), and male childhood friend is nonexistent outside of 1-2 speaking lines. That isn't to say its bad though, its pretty entertaining. I'll refrain from picking best girl for now, since I might get shredded to pieces by certain fanbases.

Up next:

1. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (13-64)
2. Monster (11-74)
3. Fooly Cooly

Despite being on spring break I didn't watch much anime because of college basketball.

**Legend of the Galactic Heroes 39-47/110**

These episodes were good. [Spoilers](/s "Reinhard taking over Phezzan was a bit unexpected. I can't remember if he explained that was actually going to do that or not. I thought he was just going to use the Phezzan Corridor and not do anything to the country. The Alliance seems screwed right now... but I'm only 47 episodes into a 110 episode series so I'm sure Yang will find a way out.")

**Haiyore! Nyaruko-san 10-12/12 -> Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W 1-3/12**

I found a website that explains every reference in this show. It's staggering. I feel like I get around 10% of them. If you're bored watch the first episode and see what you get, then go [here](http://nyaruref.blogspot.sg/2012/04/haiyore-nyaruko-san-episode-1.html) (ep 1 spoilers obviously) and realize you suck at this anime thing.

Right now I'm in the middle of **Zankyou no Terror [6/11]**

I never got time to fit it into my schedule while it was airing, so now I'm giving it a try. I'm really liking it so far, it's got a really good concept and great characters. But the ending is key so I hope that it holds up till the end. I've heard stories that it doesn't finish as strongly as it started.

Plus my Spice and Wolf Rewatch started today, so I'm watching that everyday now as well :)

**Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn (4-7/7)**

This was actually my first foray into the Gundam universe, which may or may not have been a good idea. I researched a bit of "lore" if you will before watching, so it made enough sense for me to follow the story. It had a very slow start but quickly gripped me in its final episodes. I particularly liked the characters of Full Frontal and Marida Cruz.

**Guilty Crown (22/22)**

I finally decided to watch this for a variety of reasons that may or may not have had to do with Hiroyuki Sawano and Tetsurou Araki. I knew going into this that it was not going to be that great, but felt I should watch it to see if it really was as bad as everyone says. And was it? Well, yes and no. There were a plethora of writing and dialogue issues, a very convoluted plot full of holes, and fanservice in places it really shouldn't have been, however I can't say I didn't enjoy it. As awful and convoluted as the story itself was the music, animation, and one or two good characters (see: Ayase) kept me watching. 

**Haikyuu!! (6/26)**

I love me a good sports anime, and this seems to fit the bill. The main characters are really likable, and it seems so far that for a sports anime this one is relatively realistic, at least compared to more dramatized sports anime like Ippo or Kuroko (which are still good, just in different ways).

I just finished **Mushishi's** first season, and I loved it. I have always been keen of "artsy" and unorthodox approach to all forms of art, and Mushishi wasn't any exception.

Started downloading a lot of my favorite shows/movies, so just a bunch of rewatching.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Episode 25-55~:**

Still a great show, but not as interesting the second time around without any of the mystery.  Last episode I watched had the fight between [FMA:B] (/s "Kimblee and Alphonse+Heinkel") and [] (/s "Sloth and Armstrong siblings") which were both great.

**Sword of the Stranger:**

Second time around for this one as well and got bored waiting for the good fight scenes to happen.  Spends too much time developing characters who don't really matter.

**Redline:**

Third or fourth time watching this.  I really love the soundtrack in this movie, especially during the races.  Animation is fantastic and I really like the character designs.  Ending is a bit weird, but still enjoyed it.

I just finished watching **Inou Battle wa Nichijoukei No Nakade** (When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace) today.

The humorous way in which the author deals with the chuuni syndrome, plus the realistic way the author views himself and the way he behaves really clicked with me. I don't usually like harem anime, but all the characters in the show seemed genuinely likable in a very non-pretentious way.

Kind of sad that there's no second season because [End of Ep 12 Spoiler](/s "I really want to know what the deal is with the Fairy Wars"), but I guess I'll have to read the light novel to find out :)

Also, there's a current rewatch going on for **Monster** and **Spice and Wolf**, so I kind of want to watch one of them too. Any recommendations on which one?
>> ARTICLE
I heard the lns for inou battle are actually not that much ahead from where the anime ended, i think just one volume that wasnt adapted i think, not certain though
>> ARTICLE
I'm hosting the monster rewatch,  so I'll say that one =P.  Really though,  it is my favorite anime of all time,  and I think it's something that everyone should watch.  Has the most amazing storytelling,  characters,  aesthetic... I just love it. 

I do like spice and Wolf a lot too though.

Just started watching Ep 1. Already getting creepy vibes from the very beginning, lol.

The episode 5 & 6 discussion thread is going up today! :D

And yes, very creepy.

I started watching Gundam Unicorn last night. I downloaded the first episode on my phone but never got around to starting it (seriously, 59 mins!), but finally did last night... then continued halfway through episode 2, fell asleep at around 2am. Woke up at 6:30, finished the second half of episode 2 then watched half of episode 3. I'm stuck there for now, perhaps I'll wait until next weekend to watch more b/c of papers to write.

I've had the OST for Gundam Unicorn for a while, all 4 discs, and that stuff is GLORIOUS. Hearing it in the show is just amazing. I was watching on my phone in bed, so perhaps my speakers failed me a little bit, but it would be nice if the music was a little more emphasized in the show. As it was it seemed slightly relegated to the background (but still beautiful). I may have to watch with headphones in next time. Maybe on the bus to school or something like that.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think the soundtrack might come through better with either headphones or bigger speakers. But it is true it's more put to service than allowed to shine for its own sake in the anime -- from what I recall, I like how it's used in episode 5, though.

Spice and Wolf 1-5, really looking forward to how their relationship develops!

**Mekakucity Actors**

I'm usually averse to Shaft's style, so I did not even give this a thought back when it first aired. What made me pick it up was finding a link in /r/animemusic that pointed at [this cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aM983e_pNc) of a song from it, and its bittersweetness got me interested.

So far, I'm 3 episodes away from the end, and quite enjoyed it. I like when anime gives normal, innocent kids tragic back stories and have them live through urban fantasy drama, and this was no exception. I also think Shaft's style matched the story and was able to present it well, and it's making me considering going back for a 4th attempt to get through Bakemonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
**Full Metal Panic! Eps 3(?)-24**

I really don't remember what episode I started with this week but I think it was 3.

Watched the first two episodes back when I bought the show a few months ago but neglected it for a while and just came back.

Overall, I'd rank it a 7. Kaname kept going from likeable to really annoying in my book, though Luci Christian's strong performance made me ultimately like her. The dub cast was pretty solid, and I can't really remember anyone being too awful.

My biggest gripe is the "The Wind Blows at Home" three parter. [Spoilers](#s "All the marines aside from the token girl were assholes and I didn't feel bad when any of them inevitably got killed. I was more relieved they were finally out of the story.")

Also [Spoilers 2: Electric Boogaloo] (#s "Gauron continually coming back from getting blown up was annoying too, and apparently he's in The Second Raid? Dammit. He's not even a good villain, just evil for the sake of being evil.")

FMP reminded me of Gundam 00 what with mysterious, essentially magic power sources, secret organizations policing the world, and unlocking potential in humans.

---

**Gargantia on the Verduous Planet eps 3-4**

Another old purchase I haven't touched in months so I watched a little more. It's entertaining enough and has some nice fish-out-of-water moments. The language barrier is a nice touch too.

---

**Sora no Woto eps 1-3**

I don't even remember how I found this but so far it's a nice show. 

The odd blend of WW2 era stuff with future-tech is strange, as well as the Japanese school in a country that seems to be fantasy Switzerland. Not complaining though, I like weird anachronisms in shows, as long as there's a decent explanation.

The characters all seem good enough, though the other Private is kind of annoying. I really like Rio and Noel so far. Rio has a nice seiyuu and Noel has a cute design.

The music is good too. Nice OP by Kalafina, catchy ED, and nice OST by Michiru Oshima. The Amazing Grace rendition in episode 3 was good, though I hear it gets drove into the ground pretty hard in later episodes.

What I'm really wondering is [Spoilers 3.33](#s "Does that weird skeleton in the lake ever get explained?") I don't actually want an answer to that, I'm just wondering out loud.
>> ARTICLE
> The Amazing Grace rendition in episode 3 was good, though I hear it gets drove into the ground pretty hard in later episodes.

I never really found that the song was drove in the ground, it was certainly used a lot, but not to the extent that it was annoying. I quite like the song actually, and the full orchestral version from episode 3 gave me chills when I first heard it.

I finished Hunter X Hunter. I am now going to take a while off anime so I can deal with the void. Instead I'm going to finish off the last 2 routes of Grisaia, then go back and get all the bad ends.

**Katekyo Hitman Reborn! 46 - 100** 
The Varia Arc was quite good and very entertaining. [Hitman Reborn spoilers](/s "Tsuna vs Xanxus was badass"). I'm in the middle of the future arc now and the pacing is so slow. [Hitman Reborn spoilers](/s "a good 20 episodes just to get into the base") As of now its a pretty typical shouen but fun to watch. Tsuna has some pretty solid character development and power ups. So far **8/10**

^^my ^^unorganized ^^thoughts

**Blade And Soul 4-13/13**

I told myself I'd go back and watch everything I've dropped, so I started with le Blade And Soul. Also, it's directed by the same guy who directed Texhnolyze, so I was curious. I originally dropped it during spring due to it boring the hell out of me. And now that I gone back, guess what: [Spoilers](/s "it still does"). 

The voice casting and acting was atrocious. It was done by Gonzo, so it looks like vomit. The characters are almost non-existant, and the music is quite bad. Pretty much everything about this show sucks, but that's usually the case when you try to adapt a [Korean video game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9jUtpZ9eCI). 

The only thing that was enjoyable was the *hilariously* bad and entirley CGI [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYiMnWlI3pQ). **3/10**

**Bleach 73-79/366**

More filler. But hey! a new [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s94SBuQ99U) by Beat Crusaders, so that's good. **[Enjoy this totally irrelevant video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWr7DpsJ_VU&feature=iv&src_vid=vlKc7scdwto&annotation_id=annotation_2338749267)/10**

**Casshern Sins 24/24**

Probably one of the best looking art styles I've seen in a while. Casshern Sins looks simply [beautiful](http://i.imgur.com/lKo61FA.png).

It's a bit slow paced, which can throw a lot of people off. It's also episodic, but a tweest in the middle of the show sort of kicks the plot. The middle part of the second could have been better. Bretty good. Also, one of the best [OPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CekDIGxNprE) ever. **7/10**

**Ergo Proxy 23/23**

It had quite a few interesting ideas, but never really did anything with them. 

The animation was quite inconsistent at times. Sometimes it looks like [*quality*](http://i.imgur.com/cmGeiF4.png), and other times looks like [QUALITY](http://i.imgur.com/gdBMrJc.png), but Manglobe's never really been consistent with their original works. 

The game show episode was pretty cool. **6/10**

**Glasslip 13/13 Rewatch**

I like Glasslip.

I don't think it's perfect however. The "fragments" were pretty stupid, those could of just been wiped out completely. The way they displayed dialogue was kinda [weird](http://i.imgur.com/gVH5yN8.png), and at times had this "filter" to [them](http://i.imgur.com/KTdSKZn.png)

I did like the relationships however, and relationships (teenage relationships to be precise) are the main focus of Glasslip. It's a pure slice of life, and I think it did it fairly well. Plus all grils were [qt](http://i.imgur.com/So60M6q.png) Also, this show needs more doujins. **6/10**

**Jojo's Bizarre Adventure 1-3/26**

Not really into it so far, but I'm hoping it gets better. **Pretty manly [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4to1-4vaTU0)/10** 

**Monster 1-4/74 Rewatch**

Old Madhouse is pretty cool. **[Kickass OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n86hgIXc1BM)/10**

I think I'll start Kaiji this week.
>> ARTICLE
JoJo certainly gets better. I wasn't really into it, but it came recommended from a friend who's opinion I really trust, so I decided to give it more of a shot than I normally would have. It definitely picked up around episode 10 for me.

Also, that OP might actually be my least favorite out of the series.
>> ARTICLE
* Carnival Phantasm: 1-12/12 | That was weird but mostly amusing. 8/10.
* Fate/Zero: Onegai! Einzbern Soudanshitsu: 1-6/6 | This reminded me most of the Tiger Dojo (and in fact, I'm fairly certain [that](/s "the girl in the room is Tiger, which was a pretty neat tie-in to the VN, since I'm sure it 'inspired' Tiger to go on and found the dojo")). It should definitely be watched [as](/s "each hero dies"). 7/10.

I've had a lot of free time these past few weeks, so I've gone and picked out some anime that others here and on /r/animesuggest suggested.

[**Natsume Yuujinchou**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou)

Currently on season 2, this anime is incredibly touching and entertaining. Each story is so unique that you almost forget that it's an episodic series, with a formula in mind for each episode. This anime can develop characters better in an episode than most other anime can in a season. You'll often find yourself tearing up for characters that were introduced only 10 minutes ago. I'm really glad there's still 2 more seasons to go.

9/10

[**Heroic Age**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2002/Heroic_Age)

From the get-go this anime had exceeded my expectations to the point that I marathoned all 26 episodes in a few days. The art is endearing, the characters are well written, the story is grandiose and striking. The show's potential suffers from average animation at times, but during plot-heavy fights they step it up big time and really go ham on their budget.

8/10

[**Nausica of the Valley of the Wind**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/572/Kaze_no_Tani_no_Nausica%C3%A4)

After finishing Princess Mononoke a week prior, I thought I'd delve into another Ghibli film. What I love so much about Ghibli's films is that their main characters are so strong, they really emit this aura of heroism in their actions and behaviors. Nausicaa is no exception, and being a woman made it even better. When the movie was near its conclusion, I didn't want it to end. It felt incomplete, that there was another story to be told. That's a symptom of extraordinary world-building. Well done yet again, Studio Ghibli.

10/10

[Death Note (18-37/37)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note) - Finished watching Death Note last night and damn, that was one hell of a ride. The entire story was so well-written and interesting, and all the characters, I thought, were likable for their own reasons and all had their own interesting motives. I personally loved the battles of wits between Light and L [Death Note Spoilers](/s "And later Near and Mello") and it really made me want to look into similar shows and added a few to my PTW list. Overall, I was very pleased with Death Note and a big shout-out to the friend who made me watch the first two episodes. Now, to watch the live-action movies...

[K-On! (Re-Watch)(12-13 + Live House)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On!) - Finished my K-On re-watch a few nights ago and it was just so satisfying. K-ON is a series that holds a really special place in my heart and watching it again just solidified it's spot even more. It was possibly even better the second time, and I even changed my opinion on best girl (I'm so sorry, Mio.) during this watch.

[Kill La Kill (6-7/24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18679/Kill_la_Kill) - Caught up on last week's episode on Netflix and continuing to watch through Toonami's airing of the KLK dub. I really loved Ep. 7's look on how the ranking of Goku uniforms affect people's daily lives and living conditions, and I felt (while the concept has been done a lot) Kill La Kill did it really well. Plus, Mako was a bad-ass when she was fighting Ryuuko.

*The week ahead*: Starting Code Geass tonight and most likely either my rewatch of K-On!! (2nd season) with it. May put a pause on Geass later this week, as I've been intending to wait til the end and marathon Rolling Girls.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass is the most similar show you'll find to Death Note so if you enjoyed one you should enjoy the other. Lelouch is actually a bit more cooler than Light too. 
>> ARTICLE
>Lelouch is actually a bit more cooler than Light too.

That's an understatement.

Finished **Working S2** and **Nisekoi** this week. Both were a lot more fun then I thought they would be. I wish I watched Nisekoi when it aired since discussing it would have been a blast I bet! I think I've picked out my favourite and it might be the first "harem" anime that I actually enjoyed.

I just just started **Yozakura Quartet** so I'm hoping that's as exciting and fun as it sounds
>> ARTICLE
just a heads up if you're watching "yozakura quartet hana no uta" make sure you watch "hoshi no umi" in between episode 8 and 9
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I have the little [chart](http://i.imgur.com/AZ8GqrE.png) ready at all times. Hopefully it's not too confusing or a debatable order (like Haruhi)
>> ARTICLE
I remembered someone recommended me watch Kaiji (I think it was in relation to my admiration of Death Parade and it's game based moral story). I finally got over the "odd" art style with the eye-poking noses and all. So I got into the story, and at first I was like, "really... rock-paper-scissors? what is up with that?"

Then I got past 4 episodes, and all the complaints had gone away. I am at episode 15 right now, and I am constantly impressed by the fucked up nature of the games. 

This show is pretty dark. I like it.
>> ARTICLE
>I am constantly impressed by the fucked up nature of the games.

Oh, you have seen NOTHING yet my friend...
>> ARTICLE
Not that much this week.   

[**B Gata H Kei: Yamada's First Time**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7817/B_Gata_H_Kei) (1-6/12) - Interesting show. Is this a legit romance one? I never would've expected from reading the summary. It's good. The jokes kinda remind me of Seitokai Yakuindomo.  

[**Nisekoi**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18897/Nisekoi) (13-15/20) - I just started watching this again this week after putting it "on-hold" for so long. Maybe if I finish it, I'll watch the second season. The Waifu Wars are too strong in this one! I'm still undecided on whose side I'm on. I might even be on no side! The harem keeps piling on. And there will be more characters introduced, right? Crazy. I wonder how this will end. Maybe a harem ending? Maybe Ichigo actually [conspiracy theory](/s "gave out keys to multiple girls, hoping that he has a harem")? That would be a really funny way to end it. So many fans would be mad though.

Currently watching [Nodame Cantabile Paris Hen](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1698/Nodame_Cantabile). After watching [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4477/Nodame_Cantabile_Paris_Hen), I decided I should finish watching season 2 of Nodame Cantabile. I watched the first season a while ago, enjoyed it, but never had time/forgot about the other seasons.

**[Tokyo Magnitude 8.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=6211)** 1-11/11

Went into this not knowing much and it kicked me right in the feels. 10/10

**[His and Her Circumstances](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=145)** 1-26/26

Bit of an oldie but quite enjoyed it, however seems they ran out of budget towards the end as the quality drops. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
**Star Driver**  
Finished this. The 2nd half was really good and that last few episodes were unbelievably good. I liked it a lot, but it's definitely not everyones cup of tea. (Rating: 7,5/10. 8 on MAL)

**Katanagatari** (up to ep5)  
Interesting story and a wonderful leading main couple. The 50min episode format is killing me though. Still highly enjoying.
>> ARTICLE
**Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai (9/24):** The story seems to be picking up. I am getting tired of the [higurashi spoilers]( /s "abusive uncle storyline with Satoko. I understand how relevant it is, but there have been too many episodes on it."). I also noticed that Keiichi's [minor spoiler] (/s "parents are around now. It's subtle and trivial really, but it took me by surprise.").
>> ARTICLE
Finished Dennou Coil this past week. Been posting that fact in a lot of the Shigatsu threads because it also is a show about young kids dealing with loss. I thought it did an incredible job portraying natural unforced emotions and feels. [I honestly cried more](/s "over Densuke than I did over the entire Shigatsu show.  Definitely shed a few tears when Ken read Kanna's diary for the first time and when he finally got to say good bye to her. ")  It was definitely a bit slow at the beginning but holy moly those last 10 or so episodes had me glued to my seat. 

I also rewatched Kino no Tabi. [The last episode](/s "still hits me like truck.")
>> ARTICLE
Technically still airing I think, but I watched the first two (0, 1) episodes of Saekano - How to raise a boring girlfriend- .

The amount of meta in this show and well though out design(?) so far has been really good, that I really wish I had picked this up sooner.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching "problem children are coming from another world aren't they?" I'm having a grand old time

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Toaru Majutsu no Index. I just hit episode 32 of FMA:B and episode 10 of Index. I am really loving FMA so much! I honestly don't know why I took so long to start this series. It's always been considered as one of the best shows in anime and I can see why. Great characters, interesting story, good fighting animation, and so many scenes to make me want to cry. I love this show :D I'm also liking Toaru Majutsu no Index as well. The main reason I started Index was because I've seen so many gifs of the MC  punching the shit out of people and god do I love 
his character.  He can be pretty generic at times but so far he's really carrying the show. I don't remember her name but I want to see more of the chick with brown hair and her little 'Judge' sister that keep popping up randomly on the streets when there's a commotion. I also fucking love the school teacher whenever she comes up XD I've never seen a character like her before and oh man is it great when she gets screen time
>> ARTICLE
Finished the Big O. That was fantastic. I needed to do a bit of reading to understand the ending but it wasn't too bad. Dorothy is legimately one of the best characters I have ever seen. Really, the entire cast was packed with incredible characters. 9/10

Started Monogatari Second Season. Bat still a best. Up to episode 11. Jiangshi arc was really good.
>> ARTICLE
Code geass first season episode (15/25):

I went in with a pretty high expectation and to be honest so far i have been a little dissapointed. The reason is that nothing ''special'' have really happend. Other than that i have really enjoy Code geass and characters (Lelouch is the man). Well beside two characters that really bothers me and that is Nina and Suzaku. 
So far a 7/10 but i expect it to get a even higher score when im done because im pretty hyped for what is coming next
>> ARTICLE
**Tamako Market + Love Story (Completed) -** I thought this series was fantastic, but I think it would've benefited from being a bit longer (likely a testament to how enjoyable the characters were). The movie was a great way to end things though, so I'm not upset by it.

**Black Bullet (1/13) -** I just started this, so I can't really say much about it, yet.

**Inferno Cop (Complete) -** One of the weirdest things I have ever seen. It was both pretty funny and pretty unsettling at the same time. It left me completely speechless, and I might have to rewatch it just to collect my thoughts on it. Luckily it's pretty short.

I spent last week watching Clannad, Clannad After Story, Hajime no Ippo ep 24-67, and I just finished Fate stay/night.

**Highschool DxD (1-9/12)**

I've had this show on my PTW for a while, and I decided to follow along with the rewatch. This show is great. Action, plot, and *plot*. What more can you ask for?

Asia is clearly the best girl here. That's really all I have to say about it.

Black Bullet

I have trouble explaining it, but the show just *worked*. It was ridiculously enjoyable to watch and managed to keep a relatively fast average pacing pretty much the entire show.

**Gintama**: Man show is still good and getting through it slowly. The Yagyu arc is a really good arc. gintama teaches so many thigns on what you should not do and stuff.  I was wondering, what are the key episodes to watch if i want to watch the new season in April? Im up to episode 80.

**High School DxD**: two words. oppai! Boosto! really fun and cool show.

**Monogatari second season**: Oh man Hitagi End was so good for what it was. I loved it from Kaiki's point of view. [](/s "still sad about what happened at the end") 

**Chuunibyou season 2**: really good and stuff and a lto of chuunibyou. It was a fun series and I want more of it! 

**Durarara!!**: watched an episode for good times and I learned a couple things that I didn't know first time around. DRRR is best.

I watched Valvrave the Liberator seasons 1 and 2. Although it's rather tropey, especially the first episode I really enjoyed it and actually could develop an attachment to pretty much every character. That's really rare for me. A fun and tragic mech adventure done really well for the most past.

**Yu-gi-oh! 5D's (154/154)**

9.5/10, became one of my top favorite anime. I enjoyed it more than the original. The series has a mature atmosphere and the plot is indulging. The entire society is ruled by the game. The duels were intense, on the edge, and game breaking. I was marathoning it to 2AM everyday. So good I put currently airing shows on hold till I finished it!

If I had to criticized it...trap cards! The opponent will ALWAYS have the right trap card to counter the move.

Short intro: 
Yusei and his gang are in Satellite, the original Domino City which is in ruins and poverty. Satellite citizens are forbidden from Neo Domino City, the new main city. Yusei wants to go to NDC to reclaim his stolen Stardust Dragon card from Jack, duelist king of NDC. Jack is their former friend and the Seto Kaiba of the series. Spoiler Yusei becomes a felon. 

DO NOT WATCH THE DUBBED 4-KIDS [tongue feels sour] VERSION. It's a complete slaughter. Subtitles, Subtitles, SUBSTITLES!!!

I skipped Yu-Gi-Oh GX but plan to watch it. Some people say GX is better than 5D's but I have to see for myself

I've been watching Berserk. I just finished episode 13. I'm liking it a lot so far. It's totally different from what I normally watch but it's been recommended to me twice by two different friends so I figured I'd give it a go. Glad I did. The soundtrack is AMAZING outside of that OP lol

All 3 seasons of Shakugan no Shana (the third season in one sitting, that was a fun day) and their specials. Next up I've got to watch Shakugan no Shana S, which is only about 4 episodes i think.

Pretty cool anime, has an interesting plot with a mostly serious atmosphere, but still has the odd funny moment to it. Some parts weren't explained as much as I'd have liked, but a little bit of remaining mystery never hurt anyone.
>> ARTICLE
Chronologically, S actually comes after season 2 and before Final (The last OVA of the 4 leaves off with some sort of foreshadowing for Final. Because the time gap between production of S and Final was rather large, the foreshadowing did lead me (and mostly everyone else) the wrong way the first time I saw Final, heh.), but most of the content isn't really that relevant to the main arcs, and are standalone OVAs.

Robotics;Notes. 

I don't understand the hate it gets, obviously it is not a Steins;Gate but that doesn't make it bad in any way. The show is pretty fun and entertaining and that's good enough for me.

I've played so much DBZ Xenoverse I just had to rewatch DBZ. I never watched the KAI versions so I watched all of that. 

I have to say, it said that it was remastered but I didn't notice any real improvements. It wasn't until I got to the Buu saga that the quality really jumped up. I had forgotten how hilarious Trunks and Goten are together. Either way, it was fun rewatching all of it again. Got me even more pumped to continue playing Xenoverse.

I know the Buu Saga is technically currently airing, but it's an old one so I guess it doesn't count.

I also started watching [Overdrive](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2112/Over_Drive) since I saw it recommended on a thread over on /r/animesuggest. I have to say, not real crazy about it so far so I might not finish it. The MC is just too god damn weird and random, and not in a good way.

http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/welcome-to-the-nhk

So, after some energetic anime (Baccano, Durarara, Katanagatari, HunterXHunter) I decided to start on something a little different. I've seen people reference and talk about Welcome to the NHK before, so I thought I should give it a shot.

What did I expect: Maybe a bit of a slice of life anime that might feel similar to something like Barakamon.

What did I get: [Minor spoilers](/s "A borderline suicidal hikikomori that just can't say the right words or get out of his depressing situation.")

It's been a weird ride so far, that's for sure, but I do think it was worth picking this one up (currently about 16 episodes in). If anyone wants a more serious anime with so far good characters, then Welcome to the NHK should be good for you.

I also started rewatching One Piece, but that is my favorite series of all time, so any review or comment would be highly biased :P (10/10)

**Fate/Stay Night:UBW (12/12)**

For the longest I have trying to get into 3 series: Fate, Monogatari, and Index/Railgun. Now actually looking at the wiki, I have taken the plunge into Fate and Index/Railgun series, (Monogatari will come later, *something something* best for last). I started with UBW due to me wanting to take the Anime-only route and experiencing the VNs later. 

I've heard of various characters in the series, due to wallpapers/comments/Posts/Contests, but never really knew how great they really are. From the first episode (Prologue), I loved the visuals/characters/music/lore that gave me the *mysterious* vibe of its story, (All thanks to ***Based Ufotable***). I would talk about each introduced character individually but I'd rather not have 100 million sentences declaring my love for **Best Girl Rin**. 

I seriously can't wait to get started on the new season happening this April, and get to participate in the Discussion threads.

I'm close to finishing **Nisekoi** and so far it's ok, most of the girls are entertaining to watch, but then there's Raku, who is at times incredibly annoying. I have no idea how he won against Dio in best guy contest.

Highschool dxd(complete) : well, this was my first ecchi anime and I wanted to start with something good. It did live up to what I expected, which was not much to begin with. Decent animation, decent plot (maybe even good by ecchi standards) and a whole lot of fanservice.   
    
Highschool dxd new (episodes 1 to 8): wanting to continue in the world of ecchi, i picked up the second season too!   
It's better executed than the previous one and the story has taken a nice turn so far. What irritates me is that now every fucking  girl in the series has started to fall for the damn MC. Well, we will see how this goes, but it's been a really entertaining show till now. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a good ecchi with a good plot.

Watching Kanon 2006 right now. I think I like the gags and jokes more than Clannad. I like both the MC's, but like the Kanon MC slightly more cause i just think he's funnier. I see similarities between Clannad, but don't think its fair to compare to AS, since AS seems like a completely different anime. 

My biggest peeve with Kanon is all the lines about the girls knowing some secret about the others girls. "be kind to her", "be nice to her", "someone close to you is hurting", "someone close to you has always liked u". Obvious foreshadowing is annoying. Other than that, every arc has been pretty enjoyable so far.

Should I watch Air after???

[spoilers](/s "damn it, maybe its cause I'm marathoning it, but the fox arc and Ayu's arc is so similiar, that I'm kind of getting sick of the magic of this town. It's making the MC's situation feel so tragic. Everyone person he meets has a sad story or doesn't exist. wtf ")
>> ARTICLE
I thought Air was better then the first season of Clannad. Air's ending also leaves alot open for the viewer to figure out but overall the series is very enjoyable. If you liked Kanon I would defiantly consider watching Air.

Toradora 1-7, Was pleasantly surprised, so far have been laughing non stop. Is it just me or does it seem like these type of things, far too frequently, take depressing turns seemingly randomly, well so far ToraDora has not done that.

Also Nichijou, screw the professor, tiny little witch.

**Welcome to the NHK (Completed)**  
Well that was interesting. I'm going to be honest here. This show had a lot of potential, and I kind of felt like it could have done something more. The show kind of stagnated in the middle with the exploration of the different facets of the otaku lifestyle, and little to no progress was made. The ending was great, but the buildup to it kind of came out of nowhere. I mean, we know next to nothing about Misaki for most of the show's run-time, and all of a sudden [she] (/s "tries to kill herself because of her lifelong regrets and self-esteem issues.") Still, these were some of the most engaging characters I've seen in anime, and the music was fantastic. Overall, it was good. 

**Inferno Cop (Rewatch)**  
This show is so confident in its own ridiculousness, and I absolutely love it. 
>> ARTICLE
I strongly recommend the NHK manga then. It fleshes out Misaki and the other side characters a lot more. The ending of the anime regarding Misaki was actually an anime original and different than the manga.

**Yuru Yuri (12/12)**

I only picked up this anime because the third season was announced and people said this show is hilarious. Having finished it - Yuru Yuri somewhat of a mix bag for comedy due to its repetition on some of the jokes, but I personally found them to be enjoyable and easy to digest. 

Its a light hearted comedy mixed with in with some yuri and moe, what else could you possibly want?

I don't know why the characters sporadically keep mentioning a character named Akarin though (this is a joke for people who watched it already).

On an unrelated note if you mispelled Yuru Yuri to Yuri Yuri nothing would change about the anime.

**Durarara!! (19/24)**

I only really have two words for this anime: interesting and confusing. The narration is superb while the exposition is unconventional, Durarara!! is what I'd like to describe as a quirky anime. That's not to say you could write it off as quirky and leave it as that, as there's some good character substance which interweaves with some plot development. 

I found it hard to grasp the concept of Durarara!! until after pretty much the first cour/arc. There's lots of great characters in the show and I would say the show pretty much gives a football stadium worth of space for characters to breathe and flesh themselves out through their backstory/character interactions.

Regardless of how I feel about the anime by the end, it's bravery to try and weave together the story through several different character perspectives coupled with its constant episode-long flashbacks and great characters will warrant itself a positive rating at the very least.

**Mekakucity Actors (8/12)**

Thanks to my great/horrific habit of watching anime based off of how much I like their OP/ED song from Osu! - I began watching Mekakucity Actors without any fucking clue as to what the anime is even about, though the comments have clued me in a little on what's going on. Its not a bad anime nor would I say a superb one either, as the show jumps between different character perspectives with what at first glance seemed like a disjointed/non-existent plotline.

While I am rather indifferent to liking the anime as a whole, chances are it'll be either good or above-average in my personal books. Some of the animation drawings can be somewhat lackluster though Shaft's artistic direction helps the characters and background pop out a bit - even if it might share a lot of similarities with the Monogatari series. Being entirely ignorant to what the anime is even about, it could probably stand to have half a cour more worth of episodes but I'll see how well the anime wraps everything up in 4 episodes.

**Hyouka (1/22)**

Not much to say based off of one episode, but I am fucking impressed by the production quality however for a slice of life. The protagonist seems interesting enough to warrant watch some more - but whether or not it will be better than Oregairu remains to be seen as I loved Hachiman a bunch.

**Cencoroll (1/1)**

Very impressive efforts for a single man, I want to watch the second film when it comes out. Everyone should give this indie film a try. I personally really liked the short film but I can't really describe why I like it.

**Kara no Kyoukai (1/7)**

Going to have to watch the rest of the films to say anything more, but can someone clue me in on which order I should be watching? They're supposedly not in order are they now?

With finals done and most currently running shows heading into their final stretch, I decided to start my spring break with a couple shows I just haven't gotten around to yet.

**Amagi Brilliant Park** -- I'm 2 episodes in and it's got this great sense of fun and wonder and I'm actually really interested in how Seiya will go about trying to rehabilitate the part and also how he'll come to interact/bond with the denizens of Maple Land there. I've had a pretty poor track record with enjoying a number of KyoAni shows (mostly out of preference), but this one just seems like it'll be a great ride.

**Ping Pong The Animation** -- I'm only an episode in, but I've heard great things and what I've seen of the groundwork for the characters seems very solid so I look forward to the rest of the series.

**A Certain Magical Index** -- Two episodes in on this one and I admit I'm going into it with a bit of a bias of having absolutely loved Railgun and having attempted to start Index back when it was airing but just never having really been able to get through the first episode. It's pretty good, but it hasn't really shown me anything that really makes me want to stay either.

The Princess of Kaguya. 

The Second to Last Ghibli Film before they went into Deep-freeze. 

It's beautiful despite some moments that had me wondering if their budgets had dipped low. (Some Frames without too much In-Betweens along with just simple pencil Sketches) I suppose it was the art style. 

It was interesting, yet I felt that the timing & exposition can be much shorter.

I started and finished "Humanity has Declined".

It was great. The 2-3 episode arc was the best format for the show; the best episode was still the manga one with Y. The series kind of lost it's charm after that with the whole time-loop episodes. But regained it's composure at the end with the school-arc and queen-episode as well.


>> ARTICLE
Started watching **Spice and Wolf** and I LOVE it. I wasn't sure what it was going to be like considering the circlejerk in this sub over it but it is very sweet and the OP/EDs make me very happy. I listen to them every single episode, which is incredibly rare for me to do for any anime. 

Other than that, I was rewatching **Death Note** and hit the part where [Death Note](/s "Light finally manages to kill L") so I'm probably going to stop there and watch something else now. 

Also, my friend introduced me to [TFS DragonBall Z Abridged](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6EC7B047181AD013) and it's pretty great.

Second week of spring break, which means no marking and no lesson planning, which means tons of anime. 

**Gosick 1-3/24**

I was in the mood for another mystery anime after Another, and I can't say this one is scratching the itch. My first impression is that Gosick falls into the Sherlockian category, which isn't my favorite mystery category; the tricks are too easy in the first arc. I'll put this on the back burner for now. 

**Kara no Kyoukai 3/7**

Kara no Kyoukai is certainly picking up now. The 3rd movie is my favorite one thus far. The previous two, due to its anachornic nature, was somewhat difficult to follow and or I feel like I couldn't get the most enjoyment out of it. This felt a lot better since it feels a lot more isolated in terms of how it connects to the other movies. I have to be in a very specific mood to watch Kara no Kyoukai though, so hopefully I'll finish it soon and that I won't have to remember too much from previous movies. 

**Hunter x Hunter 122-148/148**

It's done! I think the [](/s "Chimera Ant") arc started out amazingly, but it kind of slowed down near the end during [](/s "the attack on the palace.") My favorite part of Hunter is [](/s "the various creative ways to use nen, and I feel like Meruem and the chairman were too 'straight up shonen' rather than strategic/tactical about their nen use") which lessened my enjoyment near the end and why I took so long to finish it (it's been about a month or two since I watched Hunter). The last arc was extremely enjoyable for me though. Overall, 9/10

As an aside, with minor last arc spoilers, I enjoyed [this reference](https://imgur.com/gjnWJed). For those unaware, the mangaka for Hunter X Hunter married the mangaka for Sailor Moon, and you can see a kid playing with Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask dolls. 

**Aria 1/13**

The perfect relaxation anime. Again, one that I'll need to get in a specific mood to watch, but I'll definitely enjoy more Aria when I'm feeling stressed and need to unwind.  

**Golden Time 1-24/24**

I feel like Golden Time is Korean drama in anime form. They even have the [](/s "amnesia") trope. This was extremely enjoyable and hit a bit close to home, reminding me of a previous relationship. I especially enjoyed the [](/s "unreliable narrator") "trick" they used, having [](/s "the main character suffering amnesia but us not knowing it for sure until later on in the series.") Overall, 9/10

Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's (5/13)

Loving this season a lot more than the first, which I didn't think was possible. The first season was emotionally intense and had the right kinda action to become one of my favorite magical girl series. First season took a few episodes for world building before going into the action and story,  whereas this one just came out guns blazing in the first episode. That was a really nice change and despite being an older(ish) series, the action scenes really hold up and are some of the most enjoyable/interesting fights I've seen in a magical girl anime. I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes since this seems to be more of a story of conflicting ideals and fighting for a purpose rather than just straight up good versus evil like in the first season. Also, it's wonderful to see Fate again, as she is by far my favorite character and Bardiche is just such a bro. And another opening by Nana Mizuki is quite wonderous in that regard too.

I am finally getting around to watching Bakemonogatari because I kept seeing it recommended and every time I went to check it out the description put me off because it sounded like your average supernatural shoujo harem thing.

Bakemonogatari has a terrible description on most sites. It's really more like verbal abuse, the anime... with some random ecchi moments and light supernatural plotlines. Probably one of the more self-aware shows I've seen. Also, you just can't beat the constant, brutal one-liners, [such as](/s "Could you not spit while you talk? I don't want to catch your virginity.")

**Katanagatari (7-12/12)**

Not really sure how I feel about the ending to this one. [spoilers](/s "I felt the ending was certainly unsatisfying due to Togame's death. Now I don't think that the death of Togame's character inherently sours the ending. However, I believe that the execution of her death and the change in the audience's perception of her character certainly does. For reference, specifically I'm talking about her plans to kill Shichika. I've heard others praise the ending because it turns Togame into a tragic character, but I was left unsatisfied at the lack of catharsis with her death. Additionally, the plot got pretty convoluted with Shikizaki's intricate plans to destroy the Shogunate (which ended up failing anyways). With that in mind, I felt that ending was a lose-lose situation for all parties involved. Not one character truly got a satisfying ending, again withholding catharsis from the audience.") However I digress. My thoughts above, though they may be negative, did not ruin my overall conclusion about Katanagatari. They are more like my thoughts on the last episode alone.

On the other hand, as a whole, Katanagatari was a fantastic series. I must give praise for incredibly unique animation and great choreography. I guarantee that these will be some of the most one-of-a-kind character designs you will see in anime. I enjoyed how this series stayed very far away from any tropes common in anime. Though it takes an episode or two to get used to the dialogue heavy 50 minute episodes, the writing is very  witty and ironic. It loves to employ little nuances that are guaranteed to make the audience smile. The little nuances that are implemented into the writing like Shichika's use of "However by that time you will be already torn to pieces" and the physical closeness between Shichika & Togame never fail to make me genuinely smile while watching. I love the boldness and confidence in the writing and I think that it shows through the blatant reveal that [spoilers](/s "Shichika will kill his sister, shown in the preview for episode 7.") In episode 6, seeing [spoilers](/s "the little girl have to deal with her bitter loneliness after her village was wiped out") was pretty emotional. Other highlights include [spoilers](/s "Episode 4, where Shichika's sister brutally murders 3 maniwani, and in episode 5 when Shichika gets jealous for the sake of Togame.") Heartfelt, touching, (and sometimes even jaw-dropping) moments like these are rare in a series, and Katanagatari is accomplished enough to earn these at least once an episode. **8/10**

**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (12/12)**

Pretty much the description of a fresh and dynamic humour. 

That last scene pissed me so much 

[Nozaki-kun] (/s "When Chiyo says that she'll always love him and she says something like "I love you" outloud. He says that he loves fireworks too. -_____-")

**Toaru Majutsu no Index (12/24)**

I don't know how to describe it but I like it so far. I hope that Accelerator isn't that weak because I started this series only for him. 
>> ARTICLE
When they say Accelerator is the strongest that is usually true but against people like touma who have the perfect counter he is useless.

Also the best parts happen in the rest LNs which arent adapted yet. 
>> ARTICLE
The last scene for Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun  made me laugh so hard yet it also made me want a second season.

If you loved Accelerator you should watch Index II. The last arc in the season focuses a lot on him and is arguably the best arc in the Index anime. 
>> ARTICLE
**Sword Art Online (17/25)**

Honestly, this is nowhere near as bad as I was expecting it to be. From the way a lot of people talk about it, I was almost expecting it to be borderline unwatchable, but it was surprisingly decent. The animation is generally well done, Yuki Kajiura does her usual stuff for the music, the voice work was good, though I don't really like Kirito's VA, and the writing was pretty solid.

However, those are about the highest compliments I'm willing to pay SAO. It might not have been bad, but it sure as hell wasn't that good. I could go over my criticisms of this show, but I'm pretty sure that they've all been said many, many times before. 

Of course, these are all just my impressions based on the first arc. Maybe they'll change once I finish the second arc and go on to watching the second season, but for now, fuck it, I'll keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I just recently finished SAO and had the same opinion. It isn't great but by no means is it as bad as some make out. The first arc and the last arc in SAO II in particular are quite good. That being said the second arc in season 1 100% deserves all the hate it gets. It literally destroys everything that was good about the first arc in like 3 episodes. Had SAO been just the SAO story, used the arc 2 episodes to better flesh out the world and characters it could have been a pretty good show. However the inclusion of the ALO arc reduces it to just average.
>> ARTICLE
**Mobile Suit Gundam (10/43)**

I'm really liking it so far, it's starting to pick up and I can't wait to see what happens. Really like the mech designs. Gundam, Guncannon and Char's Zaku are especially cool. Char is my favourite character at the moment in the show. I don't really mind the one fight per episode format but I could see why others would. I don't know what to start after MSG, maybe GaoGaiGar or a non-mecha show like Ping-Pong or Tatami Galaxy or Bebop.
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched The 8th MS Team? It takes place at the same time as Mobile Suit Gundam, but in a different region. It is really good and helps expand the events/battles during the One Year War.  

If, for analogy sake, MSG was Band of Brothers, The 8th MS Team is The Pacific.

**Black Lagoon** (10/12): Watched it after it won the "Random Anime from My Plan to Watch list that I should watch next" poll that I put up on last week's Rec Tuesday Thread.

I'm really loving this. If John Woo and Tarantino made an anime, it would probably be this. It'll probably take Steins;Gate's spot in my  top 5 favorite anime. The music, the action, the characters, so goddamn good, especially Revy. 

If you're deciding whether to watch this subbed or dubbed, pick dubbed. It's much more fitting since 3/4 of the main cast are of American descent and mostly takes place outside of Japan.

*Fun Fact*: Revy, Garcia, and Roberta's English VAs all starred in an animated show where friendship triumphs all (not Fairy Tail).

I started BL: Roberta's Blood Trail this weekend. Be sure to start that after you finish the main show, as RBT is essentially 5 more episodes that take place shortly after season 2.

I really can't stand the plot armor in Black Lagoon. One moment, specifically, that stands out was when Revy was leaning against some guy's car door, with the guy inside, talking to him. The guy pulls out a gun, starts shooting at her and misses *every* shot. She wasn't even a foot away when he started shooting.

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica (12/12)**

Never judge a book by its cover, as Madoka Magica first few episodes is an illusion of your typical magical girl genre. I did that once, having only watched the first episode of Madoka Magica and dismissing it outright - thinking that my friend was trolling me by recommending Madoka. After some time has passed I gave it a second try after he remarked I should give every anime at least three episodes before dropping it.

Needless to say I was hooked after I saw through the illusion and is now one of my favourite anime (rated 10/10), also some of my favourite characters (Madoka & Homura). Animation is surprisingly good and the visual aesthetics is incredibly different from most anime, coupled with good voice acting and music ("Colorful" by ClariS and "Magia" by Kalafina and a few other tracks inside). Loved the voice actor for Madoka, not particularly sure why - for some reason it seemed distinctive to me.

I could pretty much go on and on praising the anime. Its a shame that my friends could not see past the facade Madoka puts up before unraveling its true nature.

**Guilty Crown (9/22)**

It doesn't take very long for me to know and understand why people were complaining about Guilty Crown. To me, Guilty Crown is a spoiled potential for something greater, but that's because of its production value in its great visuals, animation and music. Even if I were to turn my brain off about the story I don't know if everything else holds up with its jarring character development/pacing and not having enough action scenes to thoroughly enjoy. I already feel like I'm going to give the series a 4-6 with how things are panning out, but I feel like finishing the series before giving a final grade.

**K-On! (6/13)**

I can see why people like K-On! because I can't help but keep smiling and laughing at the show. I love the colourful protagonists, though I'm a little less reserved on Tsumugi (aka Eyebrow-chan) but that's pretty much her personality - reserved and calm which serves as a stark contrast to the others and only makes everyone pop out more.

I also appreciate it because its helping me get through Guilty Crown as I watch two episodes of Guilty Crown and am being relieved by K-On!

**Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1/1)**

Despite being the first(?) Ghibli film which should mean it hasn't aged very well, Valley of the Wind should have been a very good anime at its time. It was unreasonable for me to rate it by today's standards on its visuals and sound, so I felt giving 7/10 was a reasonable and sensible choice after watching it. I did enjoy it but I don't really have a whole lot to harp about it.
>> ARTICLE
Not to nitpick but I'm certain Nausicaa has a quality of animation that not only holds up today, but exceeds a surprising amount of shows. Also whilst it isn't as good as some of his other soundtracks,  I'd say Joe Hisaishi did an excellent job as always
>> ARTICLE
Yes you're right, the animation is good in Nausicaa. When I say visuals, I usually exclude animation from it - which is to say visuals is for aesthetic and the quality of the background/characters, I wasn't specific enough. As you said, relative to some of the more modern anime, most of the animation in Nausicaa is very fluid and much better (though imo film benefits more from fluid animation).

Also as for the sound, I actually just mean the sound effect, which I should have said instead of just "sound". Our advances in creating sound effect has pretty much made anime from the 80s sound very jarring. The music is perfectly fine in Nausicaa - though personally its not very memorable to me.
>> ARTICLE
**Shinsekai Yori (25/25)**
This is why I watch anime. An incredible show with a world so fleshed out that you almost feel like you are living there. It manages to avoid most of the tropes that such anime typically use. The characters were a little weak and sometimes felt more like a POV for the viewer than anything but still better than many others. And the overall storyline was just amazing, gripping me from start to finish, making me question the meaning of my existence. The soundtrack was also pretty good, effectively enhancing the mood of any given scene. And I liked the ending too (first found it on Osu actually) 

10/10 Don't want to watch anything else now
>> ARTICLE
**Amagi Brilliant Park (13/13)** 

Solid series. It gave what it promised. A happy and fun "adventure". I laughed and I cried. Many loveable characters. I liked the concept of saving an Amusement Park. Also the whole rapper name thing was really funny and clever.

**Ping Pong The Animation (11/11)**

I was hesitant to start this series due to the art style. I'm glad I did start it. I got used to it after like 5 minutes. Only after the first episode I was sure it would be in my top 5. Then we got to the middle and it was top 2 for sure. After getting used to the art I started to really appreciate it. The art and animation are amazing. I don't even want to explain why it's this good, I want people to go in blindly. I can't even describe my feelings towards this series. Just purely amazing. Also the OP and ED are top notch. One of the best opening I have ever seen. I highly recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
That last episode of Amagi was great, Pure fun and sillyness.
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari (12/12)**

Finished this awesome ride. I have to say this show really doesn't waste potential.

I have no idea why Shichika would be considered a bad character by some, his bland personality at first serves a purpose in the story as he is a sword who slowly gains a more human side.

All characters play a part in the story and the action is just a joy to look at as well. Last episode was sad, but very well done. Ends with the message [](/s "history is written by the winner"), it's a really simple one, but often forgotten.

You can dislike this show if you want, but at that point you'll have been thorn to pieces.

**Hotaru no Haka** (rewatch)

It's been a few years, I actually love this movie. It really shows war from the perspective of someone who is affected by it instead of the usual glorious action angle often seen in media.

It's not enjoyable to watch at all, but at the same time I'm very glad I rewatched it, there are things that aren't made to be enjoyed and this is most certainly one of them.
>> ARTICLE
> but at that point you'll have been **thorn** to pieces

was that on purpose?
>> ARTICLE
there are people who think Shichika is a bad character? hes one of my all time favorites! 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. His change throughout the story is one of its most interesting aspects too.

I have seen this criticism before, but I honestly find it really stupid as his personality can be explained by the story and his development is really, really good.

His personality fits well with everything else, if anything it's a strength of the show.
>> ARTICLE
**Psycho-Pass (19/22)**
Over the past couple of weeks I've been watching this with my mom. She has always been a fan of crime/detective stories so this is right up her alley. It has actually been quite interesting seeing her development. In the beginning I had to be the one suggesting that we'd watch an episode or two, and she had problems distinguishing each character from the other. Now she often comes to me and ask if we should watch an episode, and she actually sounded happy that there is a second season. 

**Monster (9/74)**
I had heard people talk about this show a lot, but the "astronomical" (I know it's not, but my attention span is quite short) episode count has put me off. I finally decided to give it a chance, and I was hooked from the first episode. The fact that an animated show can actually scare me is amazing to me. Granted it's not Stephen King terror, but for an animated show, in the first 10% of it, it's quite impressive. I can't wait to continue it!
>> ARTICLE
I believe there are 22 episodes of Psycho-Pass. Not sure if it was just a typo, but don't want you to get confused!
>> ARTICLE
**Spice and Wolf (6/13)**

I may not understand half the economics in this show but it's still fun to watch just for Holo alone. Now I understand why people hold Holo to such high regard, she's absolutely amazing on screen. I love the way she speaks (watching the sub). Hard to fathom that she has the same VA as Ryuko and Kallen. Koshimizu NAILS the wise and proud qualities of Holo's character.

**K-On!! (8/26)**

I've been slowly trudging through K-On!! Perhaps watching 1 episode a day before going to bed. It's a good anime to unwind too. K-On is something you can just put on without having to worry about anything bad happening to the protagonists.

***Chihayafuru*** ***(25/25)***

This show was really good.  I kept on putting it off, but once I watched the first episode I couldn't stop.  I really like the more realistic feel of the show and how the main characters don't win every match.  The characters learn from their losses, and it's awesome.  Plus for once I actually like how a love triangle is executed.

***Chihayafuru Season 2*** ***(1-12/25)***

Basically more of what I've said above.  

***Fate/Zero Season 2*** ***(12/12)***

This is probably one of my favorite anime at the moment.  I loved the characters, especially after Kiritsugu's backstory.  Plus the Waver and Rider friendship was just awesome.

***The Devil is a Part-timer*** ***(12/12)***

After hearing a lot of praise for this anime, I decided to watch it, and I wasn't disappointed.  The comedy parts were almost always pretty funny, albeit there wasn't any real tense moments/conflicts.  

***Inferno Cop*** ***(13/13)***

10/10 this is the best anime of all time.
>> ARTICLE
I just started Chihayafuru (S1 ep. 13) after putting it off for a long time. I haven't cared for a character this much in quite awhile. The plot is pretty simple so far, but it's executed so incredibly well.

Dammit, I really need to finish fate zero. I'm like 4 episodes away from finishing, but I keep putting it off.

**Cross Game 50/50**

Went into my top 10. Fantastic show. I almost yelled during the final game and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Probably the most fun I've had related to baseball in years. I'm not usually into sports anime (Saki is the only one I can think of and Chihayafuru is in the pipeline), but I binged the show in 3 days. Would have been 2 if work wasn't a thing.

**Sora no Woto 7/13**

Watched the first episode almost a year ago, but never continued because I also watched the first episode of Hanasaku Iroha which I then binged and forgot about Sora no Woto unfortunately. Started it again with the re-watch group, and like most re-watch groups I didn't stick to the schedule. Should be done with it today since I'm about half way through.

**Saint Onii-san**

This was really funny. Been in my watch list for awhile. The OVAs were funny and the movie was event better. The pool and sauna scene was probably me favorite.

**Aira: The Animation 13/13**

With the new series announced I decided to finally finish the last 4 episodes of this after I started in January. Its slow and thats perfect for me, just do 1-2 episodes a day. Its also one of the few shows where I bought all of the DVDs before watching it. Worth it so far.
>> ARTICLE
I've been debating on whether or not I should start Cross Game. I loved the manga, but I finished it so long ago that I only remember bits and pieces of the story. What did stick with me is the bittersweet feeling I get whenever I see the title, and knowing how Adachi manga usually end I'm not sure if I want to re-live the experience.

[A Certain Scientific Railgun (5-24/24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6213/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun) - I have no words. I can't begin to express how much I absolutely loved Railgun. The comedic elements were good, the animation was some of the best I've seen recently, don't even get me started on the soundtrack. I loved the characters and how they interacted with each other, and a big thing for me was each of them felt unique within the show, it didn't really feel like any two characters served the same purpose. There was a wide variety of fleshed out side characters, who I thought were all serviced well. Color me definitely impressed, and I'm definitely planning to watch S after I force myself to watch the Chuunibyou dub.

[Kill La Kill (1/24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18679/Kill_la_Kill) - Started watching the dub of Kill La Kill. So far, really enjoying it. This is my first time watching KLK after intending to for a while, and it's awesome so far. The colors and action are both bright and flashy and the show definitely tries to set itself apart from other shows. I can definitely say, so far, my two favorite casting choices are Christine Marie Cabanos as Mako and Sarah Anne Williams as Nonon (Though there might be some Madoka dub bias in there)

The week ahead: Planning to watch the dub of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! for the first half of the week, then start Railgun S after (eventually moving on to Index)

Season one impressions [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2s34qu/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cnlqd3b).

Obligatory statement on how the humor and visual design holds from the first season. Subtlety of movement, lighting, abstract set pieces all contribute to whatever gag or emotionally-driven moment is currently at play. KyoAni gave Chu2Ren its full attention. [It](http://i.imgur.com/emxWRJq.gif) [also](http://i.minus.com/iB16LCvUzbI7G.gif) [retains](http://i.imgur.com/g0vjZtO.gif) [its](http://i.imgur.com/JH3Mmbh.gif) [quality](http://i.imgur.com/cIYsjJX.gif) [of](http://i.imgur.com/sHhxD3x.gif) [being](http://i.imgur.com/PuJw33w.gif) [highly](http://i.imgur.com/j4Y3EVC.gif) [giffable](http://gfycat.com/SorrowfulPerfectHorsechestnutleafminer).

The main things going on in Ren are the stability and progression of Rikka x Yuuta and Sophia confronting the consequences of the decision she made in relation to her chuunibyou. For one reason or another, I felt kind oftepid towards the story. Not that there wasnt stake or substance in it, but I think other elements dragged down the impact that it had.

* [Rikka x Yuuta](/s "While there were a few grounded moments, their dynamic stayed in a doting father / aloof daughter area when I expected them to be more cognizant of when to drop the chuunibyou act and to be able to relate to one another in either case.")
* Sophias hang-ups: I enjoyed this aspect of the show the most, though that really echoes the common opinion. Still, the most inspired direction and shots seem to follow the best offering. Ill likely remember [](/s "the train sequence where Sophia fantasizes her relationship with Yuuta for a while. Commendable work.")
* Nibutani and Dekomori: I dont even know what to make of them. You could attribute Dekomoris continued attempts to out Nibutani as Fake Morisummer as a means to bring that side of her out or interpret it as a pillar of their friendship. However, the central vessel through which they directly acknowledge one another this season [](/s " is a rapey imposter pushing herself on Dekomori. Why? Nibutani is already in the drama club. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to draw parallels between acting and chuuni? Isn't that in itself a validation of Morisummer as a part of Nibutani? Doesnt that help build on the ideas from Chu2Koi?") I just feel like the staff picked the worst possible way to bring these two together.
* On chuunibyou: So from what I gathered Chu2Koi asserted that chuunibyous effect is dependent on how it incorporates into the individual. Dekomoris case is portrayed as healthy because she is aware of when chuuni is appropriate and has the ability to interact gracefully with both her chuuni brethren and the rest of her peers. [](/s "Sophia used chuuni as a means of denying her romantic feelings, so it makes sense that her resolve is challenged. She even comes across as a catalyst for Rikka to move past this weird stagnation shes found herself in this season. In order to progress in her relationship and as a person, shell have to lessen her reliance on her delusions or else she may lose what she has socially when those around her move forward. You cant indulge yourself at every end. Yet Rikka loudly proclaims that she wants both. Why? Why does this not ever turn against her? Does this not reject the message that made Chu2Koi so great? Wasnt the whole point that a damaging or unhealthy application of chuuni begets a damaged and unhappy person? Was this somehow absolved when Sophia moved on by defeating the dragon?") I hate that the show shortchanged Rikka of growth when she was the centerpiece of Chu2Koi and its most emotionally resonant moments.

[ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3cFZs1obmE): A call-and-response affair between the main seiyuus that works just as well as the ED of the first season. Surprising amount of nudity. Not really sure how I feel about that.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion 26/26**

I started watching this about four days ago, and finished yesterday. One thing I noted was that people vastly exaggerated how much of a crybaby Shinji actually was. I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that, for the majority of the first half, they focused fairly well on keeping it about the mechs, and their pilots. Somewhat less so during some of the latter episodes, when characters start [Spoilers] (/s "taking trippy introspective sabbaticals that, I'm sure, someone else could pull great meaning from, but they're just 2deep4me.") Regarding the TV ending, I was fairly unimpressed with episodes 25 and 26, because it just felt like the series ended with a whimper, rather than a bang. That, however, was rectified with...

**Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion 1/1**

The alternate, and indisputably better ending to the series, it started off with [Mild Spoiler] (/s "the whole scene where Shinji jerks off to Asuka's comatose body"), which was kind of wierd, but it went straight from there into some hot and heavy action, which was what I liked about the first half, but still managed to cram enough religious symbolism and metaphor into the latter half of the movie to fill a couple of books with. I was much more satisfied with the ending of the movie, as it felt there was much more closure to it.

**Usagi Drop (11/11)**

Great show, really liked the two main characters and their environment. It's pretty simple yet beautiful. I like the whole coming-of-age type of story, like Wolf Children a bit. It doesn't have an amazing story or anything, but it's a show that puts a smile on your face after every episode. 

Going to give this an 8/10, lovely show.

Kind of meta I guess? Every time Usagi Drop gets mentioned people say to not read it.

And I haven't even read it so what I say should be taken with a grain of salt, but I know what happens. Apparently there's a huge shift in tone and the ending is severely lacking in explanation of character motives. If you want to know what happens: [Usagi Drop manga](/s "it goes from nice and cute slice of life dealing with family and parenting, timeskips to highschool drama, and the ending is an strange and sudden incest is wincest type deal which may go against the show's themes").  Again, this is mostly hearsay. Check it out if you want to judge it for yourself.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that people should judge for themselves but warnings are there for a reason. I wish I could unread the manga...what you described hits it on the head. The shift in tone is fine, but the lack of character motivation for the ending is just...so...frustrating.

**FMA: Brotherhood 31-58/64**

Oh man this show is just flat out amazing. I love that every character serves a purpose. Every scene serves a purpose. The story is really interesting and I actually hate the antagonists. The fights are all really well done. There's really nothing I can fault the show for. Some say the comedy is poorly timed, but I think it's fine. It has simplistic animation to accompany it which seemed like a shortcut at first but it just adds to the charm.

Hopefully I'll have time to finish it tonight. 10/10 because I know the ending won't disappoint.

Edit: I forgot, I watched **Katanagatari 4** the other day. It had probably the best fight I've ever seen in anime. I don't think anything will ever top it. The episode 3 preview sure didn't let me down. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the fourth episode was probably one of the best episodes I've seen in a long time. Really nice animation, the fight was intense and how the sword looked was really badass.

**Baccano!(16/13)**

Yes, I included the OVAs.

Well, I don't feel I can say anything too interesting I guess. Since I'm really out of the loop as a media geek actually, so I'm not that familiar with the 30s Americana, my only experience with that setting is The Godfather *game* and snippets of the movies. So I do appreciate Italiano families popping each other's caps, but I'm not gushing over it.

And another thing, while the stories are rather simple and there can be made an accusation for the author jumping loops and hoops in order to confuse you, I do understand where he's coming from and why he made that choice. And it is partly to deny writing conventions of a linear easily understood story and he goes through wormholes of ideas and then establishes a connection between them by fleshing them out. You can write *anything* that comes in mind and excites you without a worry because you can flesh it out and connect it to original event the idea spurred from. It's definitely something born from deriving possibilities and ideas, generating them on the spot within a holistic system and keeping it grounded in a certain setting. This process does unnecessarily complicate things, but at the same time, it keeps the viewer on edge.  
Usually more psychedelic titles would want to throw the viewer off, but here, *it's the norm*, so get your coffee mugs for this. Mood swings, changes of settings, change of characters, change of attitudes, scenes, repeated stock footage as well, it's all here.

If anything *the directing, the screenplay* save this show and make it what it is: *pure unadulterated fun and a celebration of media of any genre*. It is experimental at times but the transitions are done in a more soft manner, no SHAFTING cuts here thankfully, we're shown the location and even the time to switch between the storylines with the different settings and cast. Takes quite a bit of getting used to, but once the pattern settles in, it becomes a natural process. The rule of cool aspects show up in the latter half of show as well, along with more dynamic directing, as if it wasn't already.

*The plotlines* are rather simple, but the way they're intertwined with tangential connections, it's a quirk of the show which some may not appreciate once you stop being fascinated at how it gets away with that as well. Since I do understand why and how that came to be, I don't find it as amazing, but I won't deny the show's good usage of that. One is about an Alchemist seeking immortality, the other is about Mob hunt against a delinquent, and the thrilling Flying Pussyfoot threadline with murders and twists at every corner, probably the main storyline. Of course there's the information brokers who help the viewer keep up with the show and make the connections clear and confirming their presence.

*The characters*, honestly, they're mostly ideas. Miria and Isaac have the most presence, solely due to being the comic relief and the embodiments of the author's quirkiness, the rest have their rule of cool and life philosophy to carry them, be it **MURDER IS FUN**, *for the good of many* or just *a personal value* that you treasure. On paper they sound so much cooler, but on screen, mostly the designs save them from being completely flat, and this is where the Dub becomes sorely needed to add authenticity to the setting as well. It's because of some altruistic tendencies shown, along with quite a few amusing or amazing life philosophies, and a [good](/s " Faustian aspect rigged in"), I can tell that the author gladly plays around with said concepts however they can be applied while having a certain sense of groundedness in the ridiculousness. Alas I won't remember their names as much, since that's not really important either I'm afraid.

So the first half is setup, the second half is revelations and tying up what it got going, the OVAs tie up most threads and give some insight on a few characters that needed it, though I feel it wasn't really necessary to introduce a whole new murderous bastard who incessantly talks, especially when you left Ladd Russo to bite the snow and rot in a cell. 

Vino was the most fleshed out murderous bastard out of all of them, the romance did made him more human than you'd think of him. He is capable of compassion as well. Rachel(the fatigues mechanic girl) was the one that made the strongest impression on me from a design aspect, just her stoicness and actions made her badass on screen for the few moments she had.  
[Jacuzzi and Nice's gang](/s ", altruism more or less, selfless compassion. From a wimp to a total badass that doesn't feel jarring or unsettling, it is incredibly natural to see this character progression.")  
Szilard the alchemist, the greedy bastard, he's a villain, that's it. Ennis' arc is what makes up for it, along with [Czeslaw](/s "(the immortal kid)") getting with her.  
Firo(the kid with the fedora) is just an upstanding gentleman with a good heart, taught by Maiza(the immortal with the potion recipe) I presume, [speaking of whom,](/s " I'm glad someone understood the Faustian gambit everyone accepted, though I do question why didn't he just absorb Szilard whenever he had the chance to spare himself the trouble, by now he should have a good eye for people!")

And those are the people I remember and matter the most to me. It was a fun ride, but with Claire and the VP of the newspaper weren't as really necessary I feel. Along with just being left breadcrumbs for an ending. Alas it is still an ending and most threads were given some sort of conclusion before another idea spurred into mind to be written in as "a thing" and leave it hanging.

So... if I was really critical, it wouldn't hold up much, but the execution well made up for what it was doing, adapting the seemingly chaotic storytelling, each mood presented in a clear fashion without being jarring. For every dodgy key frame it had witty dialogue to make up for it, or a sharp dealing between families, or just a plain badass moment.

**The iDOLM@STER (1-6/26)**

**Photo Kano (13/13)**  
Someone in here recommended it in one of those *"sell a bad anime as if it were good"*, I should have known. I thought it was going to be another generic harem show like the ones you usually get when a visual novel gets an anime adaptation. Boy I was wrong. I expected another slightly-below-average show but it was far worse than that, it was pretty bad. Some of the girls were ok, though.
>> ARTICLE
started:

**Non Non Biyori** (2/12)

Man, what a good show. After coming up kind of short with Is the Order a Rabbit? and Kiniro Mosaic, this reminded me of what a great slice of life show can be. Cute without being too schmaltzy, funny without being overbearing or playing too much to type, and incredibly relaxing, I'm very excited to continue this.

**The iDOLM@STER** (3/26)

I'm not really sure yet whether this show was under-hyped or overhyped. I've heard it described as the best idol show out there, and so far it's done a very good job of handling such a large cast of characters and giving them interesting and distinct character dynamics. It's been a really fun watch, the art is wonderful (in the same style as **So Ra No Wo To**, which I loved), and I've found it both very funny and very sweet. However, it's been a little more harem-y than I had anticipated - that is to say, at all - which doesn't make it bad but gives it sort of a weird flavor that I wasn't expecting. So far a very solid show, especially for something based on a rhythm game.

finished:

**Kiniro Mosaic** (12/12)

A pretty good slice of life show with an interesting angle (foreign students in Japan) that they made really good use of. A few too many overused jokes and characters kind of diminished it, but overall I liked it a lot and am looking forward to what they do next season.

re-watched:

**Hanamonogatari** (5/5)

I posted last week that I wasn't sure how I felt about Hana, so I decided to make another go at it this week. I'm really happy with that decision, too, because on re-watch I loved it. While yes there's a lot of talking and abstract ideas brought up, they're all woven pretty tightly around Kanbaru's story and the weird events she finds herself a part of. Possibly one of my favorite stand-alone arcs.

continued:

**Neon Genesis Evangelion** (20/26)

**Card Captor Sakura** (4/70)

I think we have similar taste in shows so I'll suggest: Barakamon, Usagi Drop, K-On, Hanasaku Iroha, Chihayafuru, Hyouka, and Hanamayata.

**[Golden Time (11/24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time)**

I started watching it on February 2 of this year and I am done with the first 11 episodes so far. The emotional rollercoaster is serious, I am currently not sure where my opinion of Tada Banri stands. [Spoiler] (/s "When it was first mentioned that Tada Banri had serious amnesia it added a layer of depth to the anime I did not expect but one that I like.")

**[Gintama'](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9969/Gintama) (22-28/51)** - Several good episodes, including a crossover with [SKET Dance](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9863/SKET_Dance). I also watched their crossover episode but I'm not including it in this post since it's in the middle of the series. [More in the weekly thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2v3dxz/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_223229/)

**[Sakura Trick](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20047/Sakura_Trick) (12/12)** - In the daily group discussion. Only one episode that I didn't watch for [last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ufmnt/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/co82b1q), and it unfortunately seemed kinda out of character for Mitsuki. Overall not a bad series and it defies a number of the stereotypical school romance tropes, but fits a fairly specific niche if you want to find it highly enjoyable.

---
**[Shin Sekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) (1-8/25)** - Wow. This is the first series in a while where I wanted to marathon the whole thing after seeing the first episode. There's a fantastic amount of world building in the first few episodes and it's paced incredibly well. There's a large mystery element to it as the main characters also try to figure out the world they're in and I'm greatly enjoying exploring it with them.

---
**[So Ra No Wo To](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To) (1-5/12)** - I really only started watching this because it involves music, but I got yet another strange setting from it. This one's more of a mashup of existing cultures rather than a completely foreign one in Shin Sekai Yori, but it's still different enough to make me wonder what happened. I like most of the characters but still don't know much about a couple of them yet.

---
**[Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari) (4/15)** - This was supposed to be the week I watched a lot of this series, but then the Shin Sekai Yori and So Ra No Wo To daily groups both started this week and they seemed like more interesting shows. So far they've been more interesting than this one, too. I'll probably rewatch Mayoi's arc as a whole because it's been a week and I don't remember much about it already.

**Dead Leaves**

Well, this was a "What the fuck did I just watch?!" kinda movie if there ever was one, but it was awesome. It's like they took the intermission cards from Gurren Lagann, animted them like Panty and Stocking, then injected it with the insanity of Kill la Kill and FLCL. I never thought I'd see an anime that out-crazied those shows, but Dead Leaves made all four look about as exciting as Glasslip. On top of being batshit insane, it's also extremely funny and chock full of great one-liners. I loved all the characters, especially Retro. The art style was unique and the character designs interesting. Overall, it was a fun and zany ride. 8 outta 10

**Gintama** (15/201)

Man, that pet show episode was great! I think it was one of my favorites so far.

***Gundam Build Fighters (25/25)***

***Gundam Build Fighters Try (17/??)***

Both series are really great! I really dig the cast and mechs of the first series more on average, but my absolute favorite mech of the two series is the r-Gyagya. I'm really not a fan of any of the other mechs in Try! I started collecting/building some gunpla a couple weeks ago, so these series are great for learning the mechs!

A couple weeks ago I also watched Gundam Unicorn which was fantastic! I hope I see more than cameos of the Unicorn/Sinanju in Build Fighters Try.
>> ARTICLE
It's kind of unreal how Build Fighters turned out to be great. Before the first season aired I can't remember anyone anticipating that it would be nearly as good as it was.
>> ARTICLE
I was pleasantly surprised also! I loved it right from the get-go. All the characters and mechs were fantastic, and the music was spot on. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not an expert, but apparently some of the key staff members are big Gundam fans themselves and I suppose their affection for the material shone through.

**Revolutionary Girl Utena (4/39)**

This one is interresting. There are almost more budget saving mechanism in this than in Inferno Cop but the story is really interesting so far. Granted at the moment it still feels predictable, but maybe something will change

Edit: I also really really like the Maincharacter even if her revealed reasoning is a bit simple
>> ARTICLE
**The Devil is a Part Timer! (7/13)**

This show is absolute fun. I am shocked that it took me this long to start watching it. The completely hilarious premise, the interactions between the main cast, the self-awareness, the fact that characters consistently fall down the stairs at the "Devil's Castle", and the background gags are just some of the many reasons to watch this show. It's too bad that it's only a single season.
>> ARTICLE
WE might still get a season 2. No final word. Though hopes are fading.
>> ARTICLE
**Ergo Proxy (23/23)**

I've been on a sci-fi kick lately so I picked up Ergo Proxy knowing pretty much nothing about.  From the start it was really cool, dystopic, sci-fi mystery with so many questions that really pulled me in.

Now that I finished Ergo Proxy, I have a feeling that the last third is so screwy because by the time they decided what they wanted what it wanted to be between a dark dystopic sci-fi mystery and philosophic commentary, they just didn't have enough time to put the pieces together smoothly.

Still was quite the ride, the atmosphere for most of it hit its mark and I think pretty much all of the characters were interesting and memorable. It tried to do a lot and didn't hit its mark for everything but I have to give it credit for trying, its very unique and was well worth my time, flaws and all.

**Final Verdict: 8/10**
>> ARTICLE
**Hajime no Ippo** 18/75: So far so good. I can really understand why people love this show. It can be kinda cheesy, but I've loved every second of it so far. It has it's flaws, but unless you're watching it specifically to criticize it you'll love it.

**Berserk** 25/25: I finally get why this show is a classic (and why so many shows are just Manga/LN bait). I saw the whole series over two days and finished the Manga the next day. The animation and music don't stand up to more recent shows, but the characters, story, and voice acting are way, waaaaay above average. If you're going to watch this you have to read the manga when you're done because it's just that good.
>> ARTICLE
**Mirai Nikki (6/26)** I had been putting this show off for a few months and only just started it. I'm not sure what to expect since a lot of people say it goes downhill but so far I'm enjoying it a lot. Great marathon show.... just wish I had the time to marathon it. I don't really like the MC but Yuno is amazing. I love yanderes and I'm personally more interested in her character than the show's story. 


>> ARTICLE
**Nekomonogatari:Kuro (4/4)**

I think it was the weakest part of the Monogatari Series so far. I didn't really care for the plot (not the "plot") , dunno why. 6/10

**Oregainu (1/12)**

Only saw the first episode so far, but seemed somewhat interesting, the protagonist is a good character, the other 2 girls not so much.

**Ghost in the Shell (rewatch)**

I saw the first GITS movie 2 years ago and I didn't remember much of it. Now I watched it again and liked it more than the first time, but I think it lacks a bit of worldbuilding and exposition. The action, direction, visuals, atmosphere and soundtrack were great. Interesting themes. VERY similar to Blade Runner, one of my favorite movies. 7/10

**Monogatari Series: Second Season (5/26)**

Wow, Tsubasa Tiger was the best arc so far. Very very good, much better than Neko:Kuro. Hanekawa's character development was really well done and her interactions with Senjougahara were very interesting to watch. Araragi appearing in the end was just plain badass. [Just look at him](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130806031831/bakemonogatari1645/images/6/65/Koyomi_second_season.jpg)

**Tatami Galaxy (11/11)**

I heard good things about this one, especially the ending. I certainly liked the series but it is somewhat hard to watch all in one sitting. Personally I enjoyed episodes 6-8 more than the final two. I would recommend it to others but I don't think it would be everyone's cup of tea.
>> ARTICLE
**Shin Sekai Yori**

Amazing show, such a mind fuck. Having read/watched Game of Thrones I thought it unlikely that another series would be able to pull comparably gut wrenching plot twists and tragedies, and Shin Sekai Yori definitely proved me wrong. Does an excellent job of getting the audience to care about the characters, then savagely beats the audience for caring about the characters. Extremely well thought out and internally consistent plot; I really can't think of a single plot hole which is very impressive considering how intricate the story being told is. It felt like every single little detail of every episode was significant, and it was nice to watch a series without a bunch of fat getting in the way of enjoyment. While I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, overall I'd give it a 10/10.

**Little Witch Academia**

On the other hand, this is something that I totally would recommend to everyone. 26 minutes of pure, carefree, unadulterated fun. Nothing really groundbreaking but it accomplishes everything it sets out to do very well. Plus it's only 26 minutes and it's on crunchyroll for free, just fuckin watch it cmon. 8/10 for me.



>> ARTICLE
**Shinsekai Yori 1/7**

Most of what ive been watching has been stuff that is airing, but I had heard so much about this series on this thread I just had to give it a watch. So I watched the first episode and later that day I was browsing the sub and saw that somebody had started a watch/rewatch group for the show. I was so excited that I would have people to discuss and theorize about this show with. Also watching an episode a day keeps me from bingeing and helps me better enjoy the show.

That aside I am loving this show so far, the music and art are both top notch, the story seems to be taking an interesting turn. I have heard that the next episode (8) caused a lot of people to drop the show when it was airing. I am still looking forward to the rest of this show, and I look forward to discussing it on the watch/rewatch thread.
>> ARTICLE
**Tokyo Pig or Sunny pig** 6/61

This probably will get buried since this isn't a mainstream show and this is r/anime but I really want to illustrate how much this show meant to me. I first watched this show back in China when I was 4 or 5. This was before even pokemon or digimon aired and it helped me enjoy animation and story telling in general before i even understood what animation is. In short, the plot is about a boy who discovered he has reality bending powers and his adventures mainly with an pig sidekick that resulted from his powers. There are plenty of comedy and breaking of the fourth wall and laughs to be had. I vividly remember the first time i experienced regret was when I overslept and missed the final ep, only able to catch the last few minutes of it. When I eventually moved to the states and started getting exposed to more mainstream titles, I gradually forgot about this and other shows i saw when i was a child. When I started to get tired of the rehashed plots and shitty cardboard for personality characters i saw in mainstream titles every season, i craved different things so i experimented with vns. But even vns with its even more ridiculous plots and characters couldn't satisfy me. I was only recently that i realized how much the old anime shows meant to me, before i knew that these shows were dubbed from Japan. Rewatching Tokyo pig honestly makes me enjoy anime again. Sorry about the rabble but I really just want to see if there exists other people like me who want to see shows like Chibi Maruko-chan being upvoted here other than shows like the monogataris and the same shitty urobutcher-approved crap that get upvoted everyday.

Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster (6/6)

A very short, six episode OVA that was a blast all the way through. It's written and directed by Hideaki Anno, who created Evangelion, and many of that show's themes are shown throughout Gunbuster and done splendidly. 

What I really loved about it was the fact that many of the events that go on in the show are scientifically accurate, well you know, except for the giant f'n robots. It's a great space mecha anime that has amazing character writing!

> But if you have seen it the rewatch value is probably low. It wasn't funny enough to watch again and there aren't going to be that many 'I missed that' the first time moments.

You'd be surprised. There are a number of subtle things that I didn't catch on the first time but came up in the Christmas discussion club, and /u/iblessall's massive screencap collection provided a lot of insight on the art direction side. The dub is also worth a shot if you watched it with subtitles the first time (and vice-versa).
>> ARTICLE
Yup, I'll echo this. 

I was pretty worried that it wouldn't be as fulfilling an experience the second time through, but some things hit me harder this time than the first time. Something things didn't hit me as hard, but I was left with a much deeper appreciation for the show as an artistic effort after the second watch. 
>> ARTICLE
I love Toradora, it's one of my favourites. I love the characters and their interactions, and overall I think the drama was very well done. 

I've seen people talk about it being melodramatic, and upon rewatcing scenes I can agree that some are over done, but I never felt that in the moment of the show. There are shows that make the melodrama apparent by being in your face, just forcing the situation and intended "feels" moments upon the viewer, and they really take me out of the moment. It ultimately leaves me with a negative impression of the scene/show because it feels fake, forced, and sometimes even condescending. Toradora, on the other hand, always felt natural; I cared so much about everything that was happening and who it was happening to that it doesn't matter if parts were exaggerated. Anyways, I liked the show. A lot.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Seitokai Yakuindomo, I finished the first season and the OVAs that come with the first season. Sex jokes the anime is what it's also known as and goddamn, it's no exaggeration. Sex jokes are lurking in every corner, the girls are hot, the characters are all unique and interesting and there was a lot of fan service... but I didn't care about that cause I was really having a blast and it made it so much better. I'd recommend the anime if you're just looking for a "just-for-laughs" or "feel-good" anime.

**LovelyComplex(3/24)**

This is often reccomended as one of the better Romances and because I kinda felt like watching one (and the issue of height complexes may be applied to me too), I gave it a shot. 

After the first three episodes I can say that I definetly will watch this one to the end. The comedy is fine and the characters are quite entertaining but its also a Shoujo and as such has a few elements that have always somewhat annoyed me.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion(24/24)**

This was one hell of a ride and Im glad I finally got around watching it. 10/10 no need for words here.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Love com a couple years ago, and it was the first subbed anime I ever saw. Tbh, it never really seemed like a good romance story at all. It was mostly forgettable. The OP of the first half of the season was good though.
>> ARTICLE
**Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai (7/24)**  

After nearly a year, I picked up the show again. I was really glad for the recap at the start of episode 6, but most of it I remembered. I am really happy that [spoiler](/s "Everyone is beginning to remember the various timelines").  

I think my problem with the series is that, to me, it cannot seem to balance the plot progression very well. Sometimes there would be episodes that absolutely nothing happens and do not affect the story in the future at all. They were not set up as red herrings either, but they are just there and do not come up again.  

However, when they go into the plot, it is done pretty well. I can't wait to see how the next episode will be done.

MSG: 0080 War in the Pocket EP2: 

The kid is portraying young kids very well. Sometimes though I feel that the show needed not to really have a gundam theme to it, and could have been standalone to some extent.

>> ARTICLE
Between LCS, playing League of Peasants, watching airing shows, school work and working part time for my parent,  I fucking hate how little time I can dedicate to watching non-airing shows, especially those that are very good. I managed to fit 1 episode in but I am definitiely thirsting (heh) for more. 

**Nagi no Asukara Episode 5/26**

I can't really decide my feelings but this episode was probably my least favorite. 

Hikari felt uncharacteristically mature which felt more like a plot-moving change rather than a natural one. He generally is unable to do the right thing without putting his feelings first. 

Chisaki's conflict is pretty cliche along with the love polygon + line. I've already been half spoiled on the romance so I'm not too enthusiastic about it. 

I don't want to be too harsh and rash since I'm only a few episodes but both Miuna and Kihara-kun(kek) have close family that are associated with the sea. I hope they somehow make Kihara's backstory unique as well as interesting without creating too many similarities to Miuna's. They strangely seem to be ignoring Kaname's backstory though. NnA consistently ties multiple conflicts within each other and creating foreshadowing for each following episode but Kaname has had little to no hints about him (iirc).

I *really* hope they center an episode or 2 on Hikari's dad and his struggles with the people about Akari's decision. I think its coming but probably not in the fashion that I want it to. This show has been extremely good at connecting and caring about each cast member though.  

Manaka knowing about Chisaki's affairs is definitely gonna bring out some suffering that I'm kind of looking forward to and kind of not. On one hand, I thirst for drama but on the other hand, I don't really respect any of the romances between the main characters so far. 

I'm increasingly disliking the David-esque Kihara too. He's too emotionless yet understanding that the combination makes him a bit too unrealistic and definitely unnatural between what usually is a really realistic portrayal of middle schoolers. 



>> ARTICLE
I really want to watch Nagi no Asukara because it's visually stunning, but man, I don't think I can handle a bunch of angsty 14-year-olds. 

Only one episode in and I've probably rolled my eyes about 600 times already. 

I guess what I'm trying to get at is...is there any compelling drama aside from, "my girl (who I never had the confidence to actually ask out) is totally crushing on this new guy and that ain't gucci!"?

I mean, there's clearly some unrest between the two cities, but if that's all just a backdrop for teenage love pentagon I doubt I'd be able to stick with it.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm...

This show probably isn't right for you then. Its full of angsty 14 year olds (though it typically does it really well compared to other shows). 

That conflict that you are speaking of does get resolved fairly quickly (at least on the surface). Which is probably what you are looking for since you seem more annoyed by the fact that it exists. 

While I predict that it does offer more than the angsty teen drama, if you couldn't survive 1 episode, 6 would be impossible.

>> ARTICLE
Thanks. 

Yeah, I was more annoyed by the piling on of drama. Angry fish (boy)friend already has a reason to dislike illegal fisherboy; did clumsy fish girl really need to be infatuated with him right off the bat too? Slow your roll Mr. Writer. Give the story some time to breath before you plunge it headfirst into the hormonal hellhole of teenage relationships.


Guess I should reserve judgement though. I have no idea where the writers will take the story.

I'm on mobile right now so I can't really write a long post about it but I started **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood**. I had always wondered if it deserved the praise it gets and have discovered it does, and then some. I'm about 16 episodes in I think and have loved every minute.

**Xam'd: Lost memories (26/26)**

Quite the unique show with some fantastic animations (because Bones) and really nice music. However I did expect a lot more action but instead the story and characters came first (especially in the second half of the show). That's obviously not a bad thing because the story was really interesting but I did wish it had more action scenes to make use of the great animations. Still a really good show tho.


>> ARTICLE
**Neon Genesis Evangelion 13-19/26** (along with the rewatch as a first-time viewer)

NGE is heading into its endgame, and, wow, I'm extremely surprised. The characters are great, and I'm amazed by how much it has been able to mesh together (comedy, action, drama, romance? Not really, but there's a bit there) Will finish by the next week, when I'll be able (maybe) to give more impressions.

**Shin Sekai Yori 1-6/25** (along with the rewatch as a first-time viewer) 

SSY is slowly building up, but it's great up until now. I'm definitely hooked by the story, the world, and the characters.

**Ping Pong The Animation (complete)**

A few weeks back I said Kuroko no Basket was, imo, the best sports anime I had watched. Well, Ping Pong came and completely obliterated my expectations. The writing and the characters are so good. I loved everything about it. The dynamics between Smile and Peco are incredible. 10/10

**Kiniro Mosaic (complete)**

Such a happy anime-desu. I found myself gleeful as fuck as soon as I finished the first episode-desu. It really cheered me up-desu.

**Voices of a Distant Star**

I'll probably end up watching ~3 episodes per day, rather than marathon.

One of my best weeks in a long time.

**Chihayafuru Season 1 & 2**

Real good stuff right there, blew through both seasons in a matter of days. Gives you some great insight into Japanese culture that's been uncharted in other anime. Traditional tournament style anime I would say, but not your regular sport, in this case it's Karuta, a japanese poem/card game, where you rely on good reflexes, speed and memorization. Good story and plot, big fan of the characters. Can't really think of anything bad about the show either. Also in my opinion this gives the most accurate school portrayal of the anime shows I've been watching. **PS:** Continued with the manga afterwards and it holds up to the anime and I can't wait until (if) Madhouse makes a third season. **10/10 both seasons**

**Barakamon**

Some good comedy right here, comedy isn't really my favorite genre but it holds up and I enjoyed it a lot. **9/10**

**Usagi Drop**

It was a really good show and it got me thinking about what I'd do in a similar situation if I was in Daikichi's shoes. Quite entertaining and thought provoking. Characters and plot were both good and it left me with a desire for more. Still haven't checked out the manga since I've heard bad things about the continuation. **9/10**

**Kokoro Connect**

Found it to be quite good, with some interesting developments. Interesting characters, setting and story. However it left a lot of things unanswered and I wasn't a big fan of the love triangle. Still **8/10**

**Natsuyuki Rendezvous 4/11**

Got started on this after I finished Kokoro Connect, however by that point I was quite tired of love triangles so I decided to take a break with Natsuyuki. Otherwise it's somewhat entertaining.

**Shinsekai Yori 8/25**

After I put Natsuyuki on hold I picked this up. As a Fantasy fan I'm really enjoying the world building in SY, liked the characters during the first arc, however [minor spoiler](/s "since I'm no big fan of Yaoi") I got a bit turned of some of the characters and the show. Still have big hopes for Shinsekai though.
>> ARTICLE
**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders (14-24/24)**

Well it's more Jojo, so what's not to love. Not much really needs to be said, you know exactly what to expect from JoJo and it delivers. The only thing is that I slightly miss is the use of Hammon, the focus is entirely on fighting with stands which makes it feel like the characters themselves do less in the fights. This change in fighting styles isn't a bad change its just a change. Still an awesome series and I'm glad to be be up to date and can watch along weekly with the Eygpt Arc


**Sukitte Ii na yo (Say "I Love You") (1-13/13)** 

I'm not really sure what to say about this show. It was medicore more than anything. Follows the cliche of the most popular guy, wanted by everyone, somehow falls for the most unpopular girl in school. The romance between the characters was quite nice but the moments of drama sometimes appeared quite forced and the ending itself felt quite lacking, there was no closure it just felt like the ending of your average episode not the final episode. I'm not sure what i expected from the ending... just a bit more than that. This show seems more like an encouragement to read the manga as there may be more to gain from this but not something I will be pursuing. As I said, average series but romance is one genre that I feel is hard to do right and good shows are far and few between.

**SpaceDandy 2nd Season (1-3/13)**

It's more Dandy, something i could never complain about. It's more of the same dandy adventures in space and that's exactly what i want it to be. No real change from the first series just 13 more episodes to enjoy and i cant imagine it to go downhill from here. The same with JoJo, you know what to expect and this show gives you exactly that.

More than I expected, saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCRHM2MSsZ0) thought it was too adorable and needed to give it a shot.

**Nazo no Kanojo X (13/13)**  
  

Fucking hell this show. This is the most cute, erotic, disgusting and pure thing I've ever watched, everything was good and fun, making points about relationships without hindering the overall theme of the show being two kids in love. Man I wish the manga was fully translated

Sora no Otoshimono, enjoying it. It's silly enough that the fan service doesn't come off as creepy, I actually genuinely like the characters and the story is ok. Anytime chibi Ikaros is on screen it's guaranteed to get a chuckle out of me. Subbed version very much over dubbed, because personally I think subbed Ikaros captures the idea better and also Tomoki sounds like he was recorded through a phone in the dub.

I have missed a lot of major titles so far. Part of that is due to me just flat-out not being interested in them. Yet part of that is also due to the fact that there's just so damn many anime out there that I really want to watch. I've had to prioritize somewhere and now, in my push towards 500 completed entries, I'm prioritizing some of the more popular titles I've missed. Last week, it was Death Note. This week, it's...

**Samurai Champloo**

I kinda have some mixed emotions about this. On the one hand, it's exactly what Watanabe does best. On the other hand, it felt like a reverse of Bebop in that the influences were just different. Instead of being about space cowboys and jazz, Champloo was a confluence of late-Edo era samurai and modern urban style. And the feel just didn't work for me all the time. 

A lot of things did well for me. The slow movement towards the destination (derided by some as never moving the plot forward) actually helped bring the point home to modern people that it takes a really long fucking time to get anywhere on your own two feet. After all, in a trip like this, the journey itself *is* the plot. The action was brilliantly done, with fight scenes that actually felt more like a Kurosawa film than the cheap Hong Kong wire-gig feel that far too many anime have adapted. 

On the other hand, I really did have some issues. The characters felt really recycled: Mugen is basically Spike with a sword; Jin is basically Jet with hair; Fuu is essentially Faye except with smaller... errr... I mean... in a kimono. Yeah. Kimono. There was really no difference in the cast between Bebop and Champloo, and it lost some significant style points for that. 

Another problem I had was that it didn't grab the eyeballs. You don't have to be flashy or bright or anything like that, but the backgrounds still need to be more than just simply there. And comparing Champloo to some of Watanabe's other works, like Bebop or Apollon or even Terror, the backgrounds just weren't as detailed or interesting as I expect from a Watanabe anime. 

And finally, three episodes just flat-out felt out of place for me. The graffiti episode was a complete waste of effort, trying to bring all parts of urban style into the anime and failing miserably. I liken it to the Pierre Le Fou episode in Bebop: it did nothing but fill in 24 minutes of running time. And if the graffiti episode felt forced, then the baseball episode was even more out of place. Because there's nothing that says "samurai" to me like a deathmatch baseball game. And let's not mention the recap episode at number 11, lest I despair entirely. 

All in all, it was still quality. It just wasn't Watanabe's best effort. At all.

Score: 8/10  
Recommendation Level: It's a probably-should-watch title for just about everyone. Even grumpy bastards like me.

I find it ironic and confusing that you mention "Pierrot Le Fou" over episodes like "Mushroom Samba" or "Toys In the Attic." Could you elaborate a bit more on why you feel this way about "Pierrot Le Fou?"
>> ARTICLE
Because Pierrot Le Fou was the weakest Bebop episode for me, followed closely by Waltz For Venus and Toys In The Attic. An unbeatable assassin brought down [spoiler](/s "by a toy cat and a throwing knife")? Even *my* sense of incredulity couldn't stretch that damn far. Pierrot was the weakest villain of them all, at least in terms of story and background, and the entire episode served no purpose but to put Spike into mummy-mode again. That's it. Nothing else. 

Toys... Yeah. Toys is a generally weak episode, yet it does show one thing that is actually important about the background. You see, a solar system is a huge amount of area filled with mostly nothing. We didn't see if very often, because the crew was always going places via the Gate system. Yet the scale of all that emptiness is brought to the forefront in Toys, as the autopilot setting has them at (going off of memory here so I could be off by a lot) a full 18 days away from Jupiter during the final showdown with Ed's pudding. For that one piece alone do I place Toys higher than Pierrot. 

And Samba, much like Toys, showed another little detail about the problems inherent with space travel. With very little around, there's no place to go when things go pear-shaped. We're so used to being able to swing by the corner store and stocking up on enough to get by that we don't pay much attention to being too far away from supplies. Yet when the crew is out of gas, out of food, and out of patience with each other, that is precisely when Samba serves well its purpose. Everything that came after that? Not so much. But the setup is more than worth the oddities that come afterward.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. Very interesting read.

I think where we differentiate is in how we watch the show as a whole. You're noticing things about the setting a lot more than I did. I will note that what Samba emphasizes is emphasized pretty early on in one of Faye's first episodes where [she's](/s "trapped in space, out of gas and food, radioing for help, only to end up back on the Bebop").  

I find myself attached more to characters and how they developed, or, sometimes, how the story is presented.  [Finding out](/s "his motive, or in this case lack-thereof, and every thing that made him how he was really enveloped me. The cat phobia was something I found really well executed. It's hinted at in the beginning, revealed in the middle, but not actually explained until the end. The finest touch being that the cat had different colored eyes and how that played to Spike's favor, unbeknownst to him, due to his also differently colored eyes.")

All in all, it comes down to how we see it, which made your comment all the more fun to read. Thanks for the response.

**Kimi to Boku (13/13), Kimi to Boku 2 (11/13)**

I'm really liking this anime series. It's funny and laid back and just all around enjoyable to watch. Nothing too serious to digest. 
>> ARTICLE
**Bakemonogatari**! It's one of the best anime that I've seen and I regret dismissing it as just a boring harem anime. While, yeah, it's a harem...the -monogatari series is just so beautifully done and the story is awesome. Also, does **Death Billiards** count? I know that a currently airing anime (the oh-so-awesome Death Parade) is based on it but...it *is* its own movie...I'm waiting for the stream to buffer and it's really good so far.
>> ARTICLE
Death Billards was released in 2012 and is not dependent on Death Parade nor does it spoil anything about it, so i'd say it counts. Still, it's an awesome OVA. Glad they're making a 12 episode anime with it, wish they would do the same with Little Witch Academia, another OVA from the Anime Mirai 2012 competition.
>> ARTICLE
I finished up Seitokai Yakuindomo, great anime and hilarious too. Started Nagi no Asukara, talk about wiplash.

Haven't been able to write as much (or watch much of anything that's airing) due to midterms, gomennasai.

**Bleach 30-31/366**

Why so few episodes? Well, I actually wrote some notes on these episodes on muh notepad BUT then my laptop crashed. I made the fatal mistake of not saving it and the rest is history. Also, midterms. All I can remember is *Ichigo did things*. **feeling like a failure/10**

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood 57-60**

Shit's getting realer than it was already. **diez/diez**

**Fairy Tail Movie/175**

Since I was strapped for time, thought I'd watch FT's movie, *The Phoenix Priestess*, which is about the same length as 4 episodes. And man what is it really [*ehhhhh?*](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/632/211/aa0.png). It wasn't that good. I'm actaully in the process of writing a review of it for MAL. **[Lucybutt](http://i.imgur.com/pferINo.png)/10**

I've started watching Oreimo and also continuing Gintama (currently #217) it's funny because Madao's voice actor also voices the Dad in Oreimo. The characters even look a like so whenever the dad comes on screen I keep wanting to laugh. It's good stuff 
>> ARTICLE
**Space Dandy (4/13)**


I can see why people had difficulty describing this to me. This show has an atmosphere that I wasn't sure anime were capable of handling well. It's totally ridiculous but confines itself *just enough* at the right times to pull off some pretty clever punchlines (i.e. the zombie episode). Probably should have watched this sooner.

**Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (aka Haganai) (8/12)**

Dropping this; It brought one or two new ideas to the classic "start a club & build a harem" type, but had neither the comedy nor plot (or romantic) development to keep me held beyond this.

Such an underrated show.

I've been trying to finish Cowboy Bebop. Got it on Christmas Vacation on a whim and it's fucking excellent. actually just watched what I now believe to be my favorite episode today, "Pierrot Le Fou."  Now if only The Complete Series included the film.
>> ARTICLE
**[Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) (11-19/26)**  
I'm doing the rewatch and I'm liking it a lot more than when I first watched it 4 years ago! I've got a friend re-watching it too and neither one of us has seen the movie so we're gonna watch it together once we finish the series, it's gonna be so dope.

**[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](http://myanimelist.net/anime/849/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu) (1-18/28)**  
I'm finally getting to watching this, I'm doing it chronologically. The Endless Eight is really testing my patience, I really can't believe they did this. I hear the movie is really good but it's 3 hours, I'll have to find some time to watch it when I finish the series.

**[Memories](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1462/Memories) (1-3/3)**  
7.5/10. This is a series of three short films written by Katsuhiro Otomo, whom you might know as the creator of Akira. The first one was the best, it was really dark and intriguing. The second one offered a bit more laughs, and the third one was really interesting to me as well. There's a variety here but the common thing among them is that they're all good, definitely check this out.

**[Cromartie High School](http://myanimelist.net/anime/114/Sakigake!!_Cromartie_Koukou) (16-20/26)**  
Pretty funny, I dig the antics and style of humor but I just have a hard time paying attention watching shows like this sometimes.

>> ARTICLE
**Spice and Wolf (13/13)**  & **Spice and Wolf II (6/12)** 

I really like it even if it is a little slow paced. It actually amazing me how interesting economics can be. Holo and Lawrence are so cute. I keep hearing that there isn't really any closure in the end so I've been putting off watching the last few episodes after I watched the entire first season in one night :P. 
>> ARTICLE
**Monster (57/74)**  
You know when a show is so good that it completely absorbs you in its story and leads you to ignore pretty much any faults it has? Well, Monster has done that for me. This show easily makes it into my top 10. It's been a long time since I could look back at nearly every episode of a show and say that I honestly enjoyed that episode, and given this show's length that's an impressive feat. Every character, every scene serves a purpose, nothing is wasted. I could go back and look for flaws, but then I'd be putting effort into making sure I enjoyed something less, and why would I do that? The way all the characters are connected feels a little convenient, I guess?

**Hanamaru Kindergarten (8/12)**  
Well what do you know, Gainax can pull off moe! I was skeptical of this show at first, given the main story follows a 5 year-old girl with a crush on her kindergarten teacher, but this show is one of the most harmless things in existence. It's not an innocent show, given the things the children discuss (And how do they know about those things anyway? They're in kindergarten for God's sake!), but it's still cute nonetheless, and dangerously so at times. Oh, and get this. It has actual character development! 
>> ARTICLE
**Steins;Gate (1-18/24)**

After putting off this show for a few months, I finally decided to watch it. I was totally prepared to fight through the first 12 episodes, since I'd heard they were super boring, but I was hooked by the second episode. 

So far, I definitely give it a 9/10. I can't wait to see if it becomes a 10 for me.
>> ARTICLE
I've been sick for the past week, so I've been away from school. 

I finished Bakuman season 1, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, Kokoro Connect (including Michi Random), and I've started SNAFU. 

Bakuman is good, and I see it has good reviews, but for some reason I feel it lacks the hook of other really good shows. Still fun to watch and somewhat educational. 

Sakurasou was super cute and a bit tearjerker-y (for me at least). The beginning was a little bit hectic and confusing, but overall I really enjoyed it. 

Kokoro Connect... I can't believe I hadn't watched it before. It's super cute (I love the artstyle) and funny, but I didn't think Kokoro Connect alone was fantastic. It was only after I watched Michi Random when I thought the series as a whole was amazing. 

AAnnnndddd so far, SNAFU is looking good! I love the artstyle and animation, so I'll have to see how it goes.

**PSYCHO-PASS (x-22)**

Finished it, after putting it off for quite a while. Enjoyed it quite a bit. Akane and Kogami are two of my favorite MC's in recent memory. The character interactions were great -- especially those between Kogami and Makishima. Really enjoyed the show, will watch season 2 eventually. 

**Kill la Kill (x-24)**

THIS SHOW WAS AWESOME. I know most people enjoy the second half more than the first half, but I think I enjoyed the first half more. That being said, I still enjoyed the 2nd half significantly.  Great show, highly recommend. Also, the soundtrack was awesome.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (x-64)**

Definitely deserving of the #1 spot on MAL. Really great show. The ending was the best ending of any show I've ever seen. An instant favorite. I'd only put it behind Monster (I don't anticipate anything taking the #1 from Monster).

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (x-11)**

I've been watching this show extreeeeeeeemely slow, but I have a feeling that's about to change. Episode 11 was amazing. Definitely my favorite episode of the show. I teared up, heavily. I can't describe in words my feelings for that episode, but I'm super excited to continue now.

**Girls und Panzer (6/12)**

I'm really enjoying it so far, i'm not too far into it yet, but i find the characters to be pretty likable, and despite the CGI, i really like the tank battles.  if i had to give it a score from what i've watched, it'd be a 7/10.

Hunter X Hunter. Gotten through episode 32 in about a week. As someone who enjoys Shounens and the typical framework they can have, HxH is a great version of that framework. Watching the Hunter Exam section reminded me very much of the Chunin Exams (I know HxH came first, but I saw Naruto a long time ago) in so many ways, but it actually focused on the characters instead of the political crap in Naruto. Now I'm partially into the Heaven's Arena arc, and I love the actual character development that a lot of Shounens refuse to have. I have a feeling this will reach near the top of my list by the time I finish.
>> ARTICLE
Enjoy the ride friend, there are many ups and downs (for the characters as well as general quality of the show) and now that I'm done I miss it a lot.
>> ARTICLE
I personally felt the Hunter Exam arc felt too dull (except the scene where Satotz is running, that was fucking brilliant), but I'm really glad I finished it because it turned out to be an amazing shounen. I honestly almost never picked it up because it looked really childish (and Gon's stupid haircut), but I'm glad I did.

Good luck having a social life before you finish it ;)

***The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya***:

Had a few gripes, but was overall a very good show.
>> ARTICLE
I had a week off work this week, so I was able to get a good few watches in. Keeping it succinct:

**Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun**: This one really surprised me. I expected it to break my very decent anime streak, since it looked generic - I just wanted a light watch after SSY finished. However, the unusual MCs hooked me from the first episode and I found the first half of the show a real departure from most in this genre. The second half wasn't as good (Haru's antics got annoying, among other things) and the ending was godawful, but overall it was well worth the watch. As a character, Natsume in particular had a lot of depth. 6.5/10!

**Toradora**: This was my 50th anime watched (I know, I'm a foolish newb) so I wanted something fairly acclaimed. Long story short, this now sits in my top 3. Loved the cast, the writing, the chemistry between the two leads, pretty much everything. My only criticism is that there was a bit of dissonance between the mood of the first half and the more dramatic second, probably more than there needed to be. Still an amazing series, 9.5/10!

**School Days**: I'd heard vague things about the ending, but otherwise I went in blind. Why did I do this?! I was hating Makoto inside the first two episodes and it only spiralled downhill from there. I give the show some credit for being atypical and drawing emotion from me (hatred/disbelief definitely counts), but it was utterly infuriating to watch and the character motivations were all over the place. Days later and I still want to throttle that asshole. Maybe the VN is better? 4/10.

> The second half wasn't as good (Haru's antics got annoying, among other things) and the ending was godawful, but overall it was well worth the watch. As a character, Natsume in particular had a lot of depth. 6.5/10!

I'm not sure what others thought of it but that's pretty much my opinion too. I wouldn't mind having a couple OVA episodes following Natsume instead of Mizutani.

Chihayafuru.  
Really interesting, I like that kind of sport-ish anime.  
When I finish it, I'll watch either Sci-Fi Harry or Scrapped Princess.

Knights of Sidonia - 12/12

I liked it. Animation aryle was jarring at first but I got used to it. Action was good, sound design was excellent. A couple of twists and surprises but nothing crazy. Looking forward to S2.

Psycho-Pass - (8/22)

Not bad. Story lines are pretty good. More violent than I thought if would be. Akane is moe as fuck.

Aria the Animation - (6/12)

Oh man I love this so much. Watching one a day to maximise viewing length.
>> ARTICLE
**Neon Genesis Evangelion (11-19/26)**

I've been watching alongside the rewatch that's going on (although I should really actually comment in the threads) and I'm enjoying Eva. It's a little different from what I initially expected - I thought it would be more consistently strange from the start, whereas it seems to just be heading in that direction right now. Although it doesn't always keep my full attention, the characters are good, Shinji in particular, and I can see why it's the phenomenon that it is.

**Hidamari Sketch x 365 (10-13/13)**

365, which takes place *before* season one of Hidamari, is more or less the same lovable show that it is in season one, albeit with an all-around better look to it. Hidamari Sketch as a whole is a great show for both getting a laugh and relaxing, and 365 improves on that premise.

**Kino no Tabi (11-13/13)**

Kino was an interesting watch for me - I'm good at rushing through slow shows with not much plot to them in a short amount of time, but I just finished Kino after having started in September. It's one of the few shows that has made me sit down and think over just about every episode. What it lacks in excitement, it really makes up for by putting forth interesting ideas.

**Tamayura OVAs (4/4)** and **Tamayura: Hitotose (12/12)**

After finishing Aria and hearing about the upcoming finale movies to Tamayura, I decided to give it a go, considering they have the same director. Tamayura's main cast, in my opinion, is a pretty average one - I wish every one of the main four girls except for Fuu would tone down their characters regarding their hobbies just a bit, but otherwise, they're alright. Tamayura's a very nice feel-good show to just relax with.

**Ghost in the Shell**

If I'm being honest, I couldn't really stay hooked while watching GitS. It felt like a lot of nothing was happening between all of the important scenes. I did enjoy the themes the movie presented, though, and I'll probably continue on to the rest of the series some other time.

Nichijou was pretty hit or miss for me.  Sometimes difficult to watch.  Kurenai and Yamato were pretty good, but I can't help but think that Yamato could have been better.  Uchouten Kazoku was surprisingly...very good.  I never hear anyone talk about it, and I don't know why.  Too early to comment on Tatami Galaxy, but my hopes are high.

bit a of slow week for me as I used most of my time to catch up on this season anime (still am behind on a couple of shows):

**Madoka Magicka (completed)**: I FUCKING LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!! I loved almost every aspect of this show and thought it was amazing in every way. words cant describe how good this show is.

**Gintama** **48/201**: classic Gintama as usual. the only character i really hate it that plain guy with the glasses who only use should be to answer doors and do the stuff that Gintoki doesnt want to do.

**Steins;Gate (rewatch)**: ah i am liking this so much more since my first watch of this.

**Kill la Kill (rewatch)**: watched this on toonami yesterday since a lot of people want to keep toonami alive since its time slot was shorten an I must say the dub is good. I love Mako's dub voice hand's down.

**Hellsing** (13/13): I marathoned this after a friend recommended it to me, mostly because I had nothing else to do. It was okay, but it felt a bit unfinished.

Not sure if this counts because it is still running, but [Detective Conan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/235/Detective_Conan). Currently watching season 10 and I enjoy both the the story and a lot of the filler episodes since they don't really feel out of place with the way the show is presented. Though I know a lot of people skip them due to the sheer amount of episodes there is in the series.

 I always loved watching the show when it was airing on toonami/adult swim. I love the methods and trying to figure them out. Plus it's soundtrack is [pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI7vJyJ9CGc) [damn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWFN2wAS2XU) [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=856xT1AQyeA).

**MAGI: the labyrinth of magic (8/25)**

I'm really liking this series so far. I wanted to watch Magi: the kingdom of magic when i realized there was a prequel. I hope i'm not spoiling myself inadvertently by watching it first, but I read in a MAL review that chronological order was the best watch order. The characters are relatable, the world is pretty well developed, and the animation isn't top notch, but the story and writing is good enough for me not to mind it much. It's a good anime to watch while there is nothing else to do.

**Ao no Exorcist (18/25)**

Let me just say it right now: I didn't expect the setting to be this. I went in expecting a Fullmetal Alchemist-like universe, with the protagonist traveling alone the steampunk world... Apparently, I misunderstood the show. It's a high school shounen, like 90% other anime. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but still...

The art is pretty good, especially when the [MC](/s "uses his powers to fight pretty much anyone"). I just feel like there could be less drama and illuminati conspiracies with Mephisto. Otherwise, the characters are all unique, the music is amazing (that first opening, tho), voice acting is pretty good... Though I sometime feel like stuff that could've been done in ten minutes that filled up an entire episode, or when the episodes are outright fillers/unnecessary to the plot, could be avoided. Overall, 7.5/10 so far.

**Steins;Gate 6/24**

Finally getting around to watching it. I saw the first ep last year and didn't think much of it, but kept reading people's comments about what a good show it is and decided to give it another try. Holy shit it's getting good.
>> ARTICLE
The first half is a bit slow, but once things start speeding up in the second half they don't stop.

It's one of the rare shows that kept getting better each episode. One of my friends said he'll lend me the VN for Steins;Gate, so that's what I'm gonna do next.

The kids on the slope

I really wish there was more romance anime as realistic as this. With a satisfying end especially the manga. This came at a perfect time because I just read the manga ending of usagi drop. _
>> ARTICLE
***Usagi Drop Specials*** - Nothing too special, it's josei cuteness.

***Devilman OVAs (Birth (1987), Demon Bird (1990), Apocalypse (2000))*** -  Based on Go Nagai's *Devilman* manga. The first OVA is the origin story with lots of exposition, the second is a direct continuation with pretty much end-to-end fighting and gore, and the third is after a time jump with greatly changed art style (late 1980s/early 1990s vs 2000). While the first two have a straightforward beginning-middle-end three-arc structure with serviceable endings, the third movie feels very incoherent and muddled with a cliffhanger ending that doesn't do anything. IIRC, the third movie isn't based on any actual event of the manga, so it seems like an anime-only ending. I doubt there will be a fourth OVA. 

The action of the third movie is much more slick, modern, and lacking the detail-oriented grittiness of the first two. The monsters of the third OVA just aren't scary. Since these adaptations didn't really delve too deep into the psychological horror stuff that the manga did, and went for more of the visceral Cronenburg-style body horror and gore, I consider that a big minus.

**Baccano! (also the special)** The animation and sound/VA was really good, but I got lost near the end (didn't really seem like everything came together). Reminded me of FLCL to an extent.

**Shin Sekai Yori** I picked up and dropped the anime a while ago after r/anime sang its praises. Those continuing praises here caused me to pick it up again this week and finish it to see what all the praises were about. Whilst I can see why someone would rate it highly, it certainly didn't seem like a 10/10 anime to me. It didn't have much impact on me tbh, and there were numerous points were it just seemed sub-par. Didn't care much for the characters either. Also, didn't like the whole "humanity is horrible!!!" trial thing at the end. It didn't succeed as an entertainment medium, or as a artistic (make you think/feel) medium, for me at least. I wouldn't say I was disappointed, since I wasn't expecting much, but I certainly wasn't impressed. 

**Cowboy Bebop (6/26)** Pretty enjoyable show with a good dub and music. I have a feeling I will enjoy it but that it won't make it into my top 10. Faye Valentine is super hot.

**Akira** As good as everyone said it was. Just an overall solid movie. 

**Ghost in the Shell Movie** A visually impressive movie. The sounds were so old-school though. Decent plot. Character designs were good, but the characters themselves weren't developed much. Nothing too amazing, but nonetheless enjoyable.

**LOTGH prequel movie** I'm just about to watch LOTGH, so I started with this movie. Nothing too amazing, but it set things up nicely. If the length were longer I probably would've gotten bored, but at an hour it was the right length.
>> ARTICLE
**Durarara! (21/25)**

Been meaning to rewatch the series and have doing so in the past week or so bit by bit. I watch the series while it was airing the first time around. I *would* have liked to watch it dubbed, but nope. I'm not watching 480p dubs. CR and/or Aniplex fucked that up.... Debating whether to watch the episodes for the 2nd season after the rewatch or let more episodes build up. 

**Madoka Magica movie III: Rebellion**

People complain the ending of Akira made no sense. Rebellion went above and beyond that. I'm a guy who is a sucker for 'deep' anime (Hello Legend of the Galactic Heroes!) and the last 30m confused the fuck out of me.

Will probably start watching Parasyte and maybe finishing up Terror in Resonance sometime this week.
>> ARTICLE
**Asobi ni Iku yo!** - Finished - **7/10**

First of all, the plot is beyond retarded. It really is. Nothing really makes sense and is utterly ridiculous but it only adds to the hilarity of it all. Second of all, the main cat girl is so fucking pretty. And the ending if just the best.

**Amagami SS** - Watching - Seen 21 out of 25

Shows based on PS2 dating sim? And it's good! No seriously, it's amazing it doesn't really get repetitive. And choice of girls is amazing! Though, I skipped the 3rd one because I really didn't like her voice. It also uncovers the true reason to why Japan was nuked (hint : Hitler reaction video; you will know when you get there).

**Golden Time** - Dropped after 7 episodes

I gave it 7 episodes and I have to agree it had it's very good moments (mostly ep6), but I really dislike Kaga-san and I don't really the MC at all. All the relationships are weird.

**Mahou Shoujo MadokaMagica Movie 3: Hangyaku no Monogatari**: I watched Mahou Shoujo MadokaMagica last week and this weekend I had to watch the movie. I somewhat regret watching it, because I felt like it undid everything the series were about in the last 20 minutes of the movie.

**Sword Art Online** (1-11/25): In 2013-2014 I watched almost no anime shows, and decided to pick it up once again in 2015. One show I had to watch is SAO :p I kinda like it, though I was [quite sad](/s "when Sachi died and later on Kirito hears her message + song")

**Yu yu hakusho (33/112)**

After finding myself rewatching the gon v pitou fight a quarter of a million times i figured i needed to fill the gaping hole left in my heart by hxh in some way, so i picked this show up. Given it was an interpretation of another manga by Togashi, i had convinced myself that i'd struck gold. Saddly though, the show has thus far been a disappointment. I had read that the dark tournament arc was going to be fantastic, and it's definitely better than the preceding arcs, yet it's still nowhere near as good as even the worst hxh arc. Perhaps i just haven't gotten far enough into it.

In all honesty though, i take it to be my own fault for expecting another hxh. I also reckon the outdated art has, perhaps somewhat unjustly, left a significant negative impact on my experience. I'll probably still finish it though, as i'm now in far to deep to be able to drop it.

**FATE/Zero 17/26** - I was bombarded by /r/anime and frieng how avesome this show is and how I must watch it and... all they do is talk. They fight like 10 min in all the episodes I watched. Art style is nice, animation lacks smoothness and only decent fight was Saber vs. Lancer.
Story is ok, but characters lack some depth. Probably my impression is due not digging deeper into the story (visual novel) but I want my anime to be complete without having to refer to  external sources. Still I'll watch the rest and than watch the newest Fate and I'll see how it goes.

While I'm still enjoying the second season immensly, I must agree that most of my favorites are still in the first season. The biggest reason for me though that the first season has a leg up on the second is the soundtrack....I just really miss some of the first season tracks
>> ARTICLE
While I can see where you're coming from, I like the fact this season has focused a bit more on the everyday aspects of mushi affecting humans. Ginko isn't really a point of view character this time around, he just happens to show up at opportune times. The first season in comparison was all about Ginko and the mushi-shi.

It sort of reminds me of what happened with Snake in Metal Gear Solid 2. The first episode with the brewer stumbling into the mushi-shi meetup was much like Raiden meeting Snake. By taking the former protagonist out of the spotlight, they become that much more mysterious and legendary.

I finished Clannad After Story and the two OVAs.

The OVAs weren't really much to talk about, IMO. Maybe because they were alternate reality stories, I didn't take them seriously.

As for After Story, it lived up to my expectations and went beyond them. AS was hyped like hell for me but the hype was met.

I see a lot of comments about how Clannad itself is just average or a bit below average and is more like a chore you have to do to get to AS. I completely disagree with that. Yeah, the first few episodes were hard to get through because of the art, voices, exaggeration, and personalities but I quickly forgot about all the reasons I disliked the show. In fact, a lot of the aspects of Clannad that I disliked ended up becoming aspects that I actually enjoyed. I loved watching Sunohara's shenanigans. I loved when Aiko would run after Sanae, saying that he loved her bread. And even though Nagisa's frailty and shyness was a source of irritation at first, those same traits helped me really appreciate her persistence in trying to set up the drama club and the play. Clannad definitely isn't flawless but it certainly wasn't a chore to go through for me. 

I don't, however, disagree with comments that say that the last arc of After Story is the real gem of this series. Sunohara's arc was alright. I love his character but his arc didn't really impress me and I thought the whole "onii-chan" scene was more weird than funny. The arc with the cat was actually disappointing and the arc with the two rival gangs was straight up bizarre. At that point, I was completely baffled by how people could say After Story was better than Clannad. 

Then Okazaki's real story kicks in and I understood. After Story, up until that point, was incredibly melodramatic, unrelatable, and just weird at points. When the story finally began to focus on Okazaki himself, things suddenly became so much more realistic. I won't go into too much detail about this part but I have to say, this was the most down to earth and believable part of Clannad.

[Clannad AS Spoilers](/s "Nagisa's death didn't really have an impact on me and I knew it was going to happen at some point. I would have been more surprised if it didn't. I thought that scene was what made everyone cry during AS and was supposed to be the scene that gave AS its reputation.") 

No. Oh no. Not at all.

To me, it's what happens *afterwards* that makes AS the tear jerker that it is. Unlike many series, AS doesn't have just one highly emotional scene that makes you bawl your eyes out. AS has 6 *entire damn episodes of this*. It breaks you down over and over again. You cry because of depressing the story is. You cry because of how happy the story is. And you cry because of how unfair things get.

[Clannad AS Spoilers](/s "Okazaki's relationship with his father was always the most interesting relationship in the series and I was kind of disappointed up until the end about how the relationship was kind of ignored. But AS dealt with it *beautifully*. The realization of just how much our parents sacrificed is something that many of us go through and that part hit home *hard*. Seeing Okazaki realize how much he had misunderstood his father, seeing him realize how he mistreated Ushio for 5 years, seeing him realize that he was a worse father than his own father, already had me in tears.")

[Clannad As Spoilers](/s "AND THEN THE FUCKING SCENE IN THE FIELD HAPPENS. *First thing from daddy*. WHY. JUST WHY. That really was, hands down, the most emotional thing I had ever witnessed from any form of entertainment (comics, shows, movies, books). I was crying so much from that scene that I don't think I really paid full attention to the rest of the episode.")

But it doesn't end there. Things certainly get happy at times but there are still some hard hitting scenes, like the dango song lullaby.

As for the ending, I thought it was okay. I think it would have bothered me more if After Story had ended at the scene in the snow. 

Overall, I gave After Story a 10/10. It has its flaws, but I was able to overlook them and realize that everything had been done for the sake of character building and making the last arc even more emotional.

Now, I have an understanding of how After Story ended but I'm still confused on the details. If someone could explain how Fuuko and the cat are related to the town's legend, that would be appreciated.

**[Gunslinger Girl](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=134)** (8/13) - Though slow-paced and suffering from mid-2000s animation quality, it's really starting to grow on me. I'm enjoying the bittersweet character vignettes a lot. At first I didn't know what to think and was expecting a plot to appear, but now I'm glad it has remained episodic. It mirrors the lives of the girls that we do not know much more than they do, and do not see much more than they do. Little is explained, just like there is no need for them to know much more than what is currently going on. A nice break from anime's typical exposition heavy style.

**[White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=18245)** (3/13) - Watching this because I'm seeking more melodrama like School Days might have been the wrong choice. These last three episodes were disappointing and now that all the girls are revealed I find myself considering dropping it. Don't really like masculine tsundere girls, even if she is perfect for the protagonist. And the poor appropriately named Setsuna is basically the Minmei here - too perfect, and a little tragic, but just not the one the main character needs to boss him around.

**[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=13601)** (22/22) - I originally dropped this because I had little faith in it, and it brought back bitter memories of UN-GO. I really dislike pretentious, white haired antagonists, which made it even harder to want to watch. And in the end, I still didn't like him. My girlfriend loved him, though. The end could have been better, but maybe I was disappointed because I was expecting a surprise or something what with how everyone kept saying there were lots of "feels" in this show. But overall, I enjoyed it once it picked up (and once I forgot about that stupid internet arc) and would recommend it to people who want a sci-fi thriller.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously stay with it. What makes White Album 2 good is the dynamic between three very flawed characters. I admit, the first few episodes are anything special, but it improves significantly soon.
>> ARTICLE
You should keep up with WA2, the first 6/7 episodes is just setting the scene up to the concert, as well as learning about the characters, persona's and their motives then it gets more interesting when it uses all this to create some well done drama.


Plus for more School Days type melodrama, I feel the original White Album would be a better match up for it as the protag from WA was more Makato-like.


I preferred WA2, but if more school days type you'd like then you should also check out the original.
>> ARTICLE
I've missed last week's, so forgive me, but I'll cover two weeks' worth. Didn't get a lot of shows done, because, well, you'll see.

###**Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko 4-8:**

**Episodes 4-6:** Watched with /u/animeclub, [you can read the full notes for said episodes here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2dgowz/anime_club_watch_22_denpa_onna_to_seishun_otoko/cjpl4zb). Here's the summary:

[Spoilers](/s "So, Erio is trying to get to be part of society again, but society is rejecting her.") On the social level, this part of the story is worthwhile. But as far as characters' personalities, pains, and growth are concerned, this part of the story is all sorts of a failure. It's the slow part of the story, just passing the time.

I'm watching the BD release, and while quite a few scenes and faces are fixed, all too often you see faces that are half-drawn. This is everywhere, and well, this is one of the better-looking Shaft shows, in some sense - less about the minimalist visual design, but they actually draw people and backgrounds here. [Example of poor art](http://i.imgur.com/PXF57Nt.jpg), and no, it's not in-between, we stick here for over a full second.

Those episodes were actually weak, and the 6th episode's full-facial blast of "anime-comedy" and "Shaft-dialogue" wearied me. I hope we're getting back to the drama soon.

**Episodes 7-8:** This show... episode 8 was actually solid, it was even *good*, I think. It gave us the adult in the show, and showed her as an adult, as a nuanced character, conflicted, unsure, and trying to do the best as she can as she cares for others, rather than as the silly haremette she very consciously presented herself as previously.

But sadly, that just further reinforced how meh episodes 4-7 were. Episode 3 had a character undergo change, but it was too soon, so rather than dive right into it, they stopped any real further progress until episode 8, using "multiple angles covering the same time period" to make it feel less of it, but it was just tepid Shaft RomCom. I hope from now on things will be allowed to progress, and change, and *grow*, but I doubt it, the original author planned another novel/season to tie things up, and in these sort of shows nothing's really allowed to change until the conclusion, so not holding too much hope, but I will finish it.

###**Hunter x Hunter 2011 episodes 1-133:**

Yes, really. All those episodes.

**Episodes 1-28:** I wanted to watch something, and semi-marathon it, and not worry about anything, so this is what I picked. My goal is to watch roughly 5 episodes a day. If I wanted to marathon this show, I'd already be in the 50s or 60s. I want to catch up to the show just as the final episode airs, which is projected to be in September.

I found it interesting how unlike many shounens where "the gauntlet" is the second arc, after we get to know the characters, here it's the first. And yes, our characters are OP from the get-go, but there are more OP charactes, and here's our "Power of Friendship!" and friendly bickering, and learning to overcome adversary and growing stronger while fighting.

Killua is a brat, but oh so cute. A big part of him seems to be how he doesn't only have to win, but crush the opposition. To him, winning isn't what matters, but proving he's superior. [Spoilers](/s "There was also the seed of tragedy, which his father is aware of - *promise* to not betray someone, so when he inevitably does (not just because that's his character, but because that's how narratives work), it'll crush him even more, as he had literally made a blood-oath to not do so.")

I really liked the Zoldyck family theme-music, the music, and the parts with Canary, and everything about it actually reminded me of Princess Tutu, and yes, the "tragic" part with the father as well. And anything that reminds me of Princess Tutu is a good thing.

Currently at the tower bit, which is sped-up, but we'll get to the point at some point. I knew Wing's voice actor, [Seki Toshihiko](http://myanimelist.net/people/129/Toshihiko_Seki) was very familiar for some reason. I knew he was Reito in Mai-HiME from the sound of his voice, which surprised me, since it's been a few years since I've watched that and he doesn't have that many lines there. No, the reason he seemed so familiar was cause he's the dad in Gingitsune :)

Still watching, but it's not the best shounen I've watched thus far. Yup, I know I'm still early, so this is the judgment regarding the spot where I'm currently at.

**Episodes 29-133, Discussion and spoilers by arc.:** Before we begin, surprising tidbit, Hisoka's voice actor? He was Squeaker in Shin Sekai Yori.

So, erm, yeah. The *original* plan was to watch 5 episodes a day. In the first week, I was at 5.8 episodes a day. The past week, it's been 12 episodes a day. So much for that plan, eh? Well, the plan is to conclude the Chimera Ant arc by Sunday, or Monday, then take a break until September 20th or so, and watch the remaining arc in one go. But, as we've seen, *plans*, right?

**Heaven's Arena Arc:**

Ren, Ten, Nen... it's all the same concepts as we've seen in other series, but here we see how they can be acquired, and how they can essentially *infect* people with them, I mean, [spoilers](/s "if you get close to or smacked from a Nen user, and you survive, you yourself can become a Nen user.") What does that remind you of? *Diseases*, where you can become inoculated and a carrier, should you survive.

What else does it remind you of? Hazing. [spoilers](/s "The trio which beat up the newbies, they had a "rude awakening". And then they go to give it to others. Hisoka though, his goal wasn't to hurt the kids, but to protect them. If they couldn't pass his Ren, then they'd die or get permanently damaged by the other long-timers, and Hisoka wasn't willing to have his future prey damaged, so he gave them a test, that when they passed it he could at least trust them to survive what followed.")

Gon shows us here how he's all about setting his own goals. He defines what a victory is for himself, so he will compete beyond the original scope if he thinks the original goal isn't sufficient, but he won't go for "victory" when his goal is only [spoilers](/s "to return the badge to Hisoka"). He knows what he can or cannot do, and sets his sights in accordance - farther, or closer to hand.

**Yorknew City:**

Here and in Greed Island, I like how each character mentioned previously, or each thing done, has relevance. Hisoka's powers in Heaven's Arena? Used here again! And when this arc ended, [spoilers](/s "it was obvious to me Crohllo will be relevant in the future, and even after Green Island, I can tell it's not the last we've seen of him.")

This was Kurapika's arc, and when Kurapika cross-dressed, it was especially easy to think of him as a girl. Even now I have to stop myself before I type "Her" to refer to Kurapika.

The villains, who even consider themselves to be villains, but yeah, are they all that different from Gon and his friends? [spoilers](/s "They care for their allies as well. They will disobey orders, they will *die*, to help their friends live on.")

I really liked this arc, but it's hard to point out any one thing in particular. I liked the fights as well, how you can see characters adapt as they go along, how they revisit their powers, their knowledge, and their resolve.

We've also had Neon, who was annoying, and we've had games of seeing what we do or do not know, and some good music. I think it might've been the most "shounen" arc thus far, in terms of how much raw emotion was on display here. There were quite a few scenes where people faced off, especially when [spoilers](/s "Uvogin") was involved, where it felt somewhat like Akame ga Kill! in here :P

**Greed Island:**

Is this Sword Art Online? [spoilers](/s "If we kill them here, we're really killers?") Is this Log Horizon, with how we actually think of the ways a culture would emerge from a game's rules?

I actually liked it when people considered how player behaviour would be affected by the game's rules, how you'd hunt down others when the game makes it easier than obtaining the cards on your own, how you can cry about their behaviour but it's what min-maxing pushes towards. Except, as someone who had work designing a game that isn't "close-ended" I can tell you, the emergent properties of such a game are so vast that they only work so long as players don't actively try to break them. But you should at least try to make sure it's not actively rewarding unhelpful behaviour.

And then it hit me, [spoilers](/s "I wasn't sure how, but there should be some coalition victory. The goal of the game is to *defeat* the game. It's only the *players* whose goal is to achieve individual victories. And so, it was clear that when players keep fighting, and using up cards, they're actively making the collective player-pool get farther away from finishing the game, as they hoard cards, and use them to fight one another, rather than work together.")

It was nice then that the [spoilers](/s ""Pirate City" part did in fact require cooperation between players"). And man, that match-up was really cool. Razor was a character straight out of american comics, or JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, as well.

Another thing that I wondered about, which they touched upon somewhat, [spoilers](/s "was why not help the players "stuck" in the game exist, and thus free their consoles? Yes, it's time they have to spend, but it'd free consoles. Get them "Escape" cards and free their spots. What *still* isn't clear is why Tsezgera didn't have all the players working with Mr. Battera work with him to make obtaining cards easier, or at least tell them the basics, including how to obtain cards, what to look out for... stuff like taking out your book when challenged, just to make obtaining cards easier.")

Why? Because in the end he still was in competition with them for Mr. Battera's reward, which is a silly situation to create when you want the game to end, rather than saying you'll give him money anyway or something.

I really liked Biscuit, in large part due to her voice actress, it wasn't just an issue of liking her voice or thinking it fit the character, but that it was *well-acted*. Why do I think so? I can't really say, but there you have it.

[spoilers](/s "It was nice seeing The Phantom Troupe here in terms of how we still follow up on the universe, and they're big players within, but it still felt somewhat detached. But guess it beats just giving us "Here's what they've been up to over the past couple of years" in one big fell swoop in the end.")

**Chimera Ant (up to episode 112):**

You thought this show was a shounen battler, right? Nope! It's Gon's quest to create himself a harem, as every person he fights with or against falls in love with him :P

I have a lot of stuff to say, but the arc isn't over yet, so I'll probably save it for after it's all done. Honestly, so much had been going on already, and we're not yet done, that it could've easily been two arcs, and could fuel any number of write-ups. About the ants, about striving to be better, about relationships, about defining who we are...

I just want to say that episode 94, with [spoilers](/s "Yandere Palm") was *really* bad. [spoilers](/s "Palm") was a bad one-note non-funny and almost insulting character from the get-go, for its depiction of... everything. Romance, insanity, whatever. She was awkward to *watch*. [spoilers](/s "But then when she went full-crazy after her date with Gon?") I was disappointed, I thought they might be stopping with that treatment of hers, but it was just so it'd be even more pronounced when it resurfaced. That episode left me very disappointed with the show, for once.

I really liked Knuckle's power, it came off as really fresh, and amusing to see something of the sort in the setting. Cheetu's voice acting is another thing I quite like, and I'm always amused when I see the noir-style gruff koala-assassin.

What do I think of episodes 113-133? Damn, this is like 3 arcs at the very least. Yes, things are related, but they're also related to what occurred in previous arcs. So much to go over here. I'm keeping teeny tiny notes, about 11k words for the first 133 episodes. I might churn something out later, though it might be slightly less serious stuff. You can have whole *shows* out of the content in Chimera Ants, and considering the length, you really could.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yea Hunter X Hunter is one of the best long animes. It's so well adapted to the manga and the artwork is gorgeous. Also... there are absolutely no fillers and, as you said, episodes 113 - 133 are stunning.
>> ARTICLE
My 113-133 point was more a reflection on the whole Chimera Ants arc, exemplified here.
>> ARTICLE
I would really like to see your opinion on episodes like 116, 126 and 131 (and another one you didn't see yet). Those are in high regard and I enjoy reading your write-ups.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, 116 and 131 are steps on a journey, you can't analyze them in a void, they're completely meaningless on that level. Utterly so.

Most of what draws people to episodes 131 and 126, if we're honest, is the spectacle. Yes, there's the [spoilers](/s "sacrifices, and deaths, going on"), but in the end what these mean is that a small arc comes to a closure, or that we're supposed to see a point as being enhanced. Episode 131 honestly wasn't really all that, aside from the spectacle, and the *investment* people felt. I actually liked its first half a lot more, the part where we see [spoilers](/s "Killua second-guessing himself, and the reflection between what he thinks and what Pouf says"). The "COOL!" moments in the end didn't impress me all that much, and didn't have as much emotional investment from me as just seeing [spoilers](/s "Killua stand there unable to do anything"), but on that front it was just one episode out of several with the same thing.

Likewise, in episode 126, I actually quite liked the spectacle, and the music used was really good (can't wait for Chimera Ants arc OST for Pouf's theme, as well as Netero's, and the generic "danger" theme playing throughout). It was the culmination of the arc about "Humanity versus Ants", specifically about potential, and I could say more about that here, but I'd rather not, due to length, how it actually is a thread that was woven through the entire arc, etc. It's about individuals fighting together for the collective, and how the collective brings forth the individual. There is indeed a lot you can say here about the mirroring between Netero and the King which the King missed, and which wasn't actually explained by the narrator, for once.

Episode 116 was pretty good. If episode 131 is supposedly the "culmination" of this arc that had been going on since the very first few episodes, then episode 116 is where it was all made explicit, where the hidden tensions sprung loose. But I think the reason it stands out to people is because that is where [spoilers](/s "Gon went all Annakin, abandoning his hope, abandoning the archetype he's been standing in for the whole time, where we see that he's the one with darkness lying underneath, while Killua is the one that can draw back"), and again, it might be a bit cynical of me, but I really think most people are drawn to this episode for the "Oh snap!" bit, rather than what it actually stands for.

What does it actually stand for? There is no change here. This is like how Madoka could be seen as a commentary on Mahou Shoujo, rather than subversion. When you think of the situation in Madoka, you realize that should you peel off the glitter, it's the exact same thing in most Magical Girl shows. And likewise here, Gon didn't change in episode 116, we've just been able to finally see how he's been from the get-go, and also how most shounen battlers protagonists really are, when all is said and done.

So yes, if anything, even episode 131 is interesting to me, it's more the themes present there that are present in general, and are actually more explicit in other episodes, and in other shounen series. These episodes just stand out. The culmination of episode 126 could be seen in Bleach and Naruto as well, for instance, and for much the same reasons.

Also, watched up to episode 136, where I'll stop until episode 147 is out.

Yeah, I did 1-137 the week that 138 came out. Fucking love that show. When it ends, I will pick up the manga, since thats finally off hiatus.

It's on and off hiatus constantly, since going "off hiatus", so don't hope for too much in the way of stable releases.

Well the fact that it was on hiatus was why I put it off for so long. I know its been inconsistent, but I am going to have to pick it up eventually. The end of the show just seems like a perfect time to do it.

[High School DxD New](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=15451) **(12/12)+(6/6) from the [specials](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=13357)** - This is a pretty damn good show. I usually don't like fanservice, but here it was needed because of the MC and wasn't such a huge problem for me. Well seeing a random boob in a sad scene was kinda...  The anime has everything. Cool and funny characters, *plot* and somehow almost every girl is best girl. If fanservice isn't really a big problem for you I recommend it.

[Sekai Seifuku: Bouryaku no Zvezda](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=20973) **(12/12)** - I loved this show. The art style/animation was top notch. I laughed so many times and yet it had it's sad moments. It showed that it can be funny/lighthearted and yet also serious/badass. [The] (/s "transition between happy/funny to serious when the later episodes came was done really well")
Sadly some stuff were not revealed, but it had a cliffhanger ending so I hope there is a season 2. The easiest way to explain the show [is] (/s "longest anti-smoking russian-ish campaign")
But it's a short nice series, highly recommend it.

[Sword Art Online](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=11757) **(25/25)** - Like a year ago I had watched up to around episode 4 and dropped it(Don't remember why). So yesterday I decided to pick it up. To be honest I wanted to, or rather expected to hated it. Mainly because of it's reputation in this subreddit, but I really enjoyed it.
[Well] (/s "of course the series has it's problems. The pacing was strange, boom Kirito level 1 and 1-2 episodes later he is one of the best. They should have at least showed us some farming/training. I'm not gonna talk about SAO being a bad MMO, tl;dr: it was  a bad MMO.")
I really didn't enjoy the only swords with no magic and such. But I got used to it and started to like it.
[I was] (/s "happy that Asuna and Kirito became a couple/got married. It wasn't a surprise because of the countless fan art and such I've seen. But still I liked how their relationship got better and better. Really a heartwarming couple. Now it was kinda bullshitty that Kirito became OP and came back from the dead and that he and Asuna came back. I mean kinda unfair.I also didn't like getting new characters every damn episode and them being just for that episode(ex:Blacksmith girl and little loli/beast tamer girl). Well we did see a little of them  at the end and the blacksmith girl being jelly of best girl Asuna")

Spoiler about [Part 2/Second Arc] (/s "I was scared shitless becuase of the damn new opening. Like what the fuck we only see Asuna in a hospital bed and the damn Suguha 24/7. I mean she was a main character in this arc but damn even at the end of the OP it only showed her and Kirito. I was scared that she would somehow seduce him, Kirito is loyal, but still. Also I could be biased because I've read Doujins with her and she was a cheap whore and raped Kirito while he was in-game. Anyway moving on from the annoying bitch. Uhh Sugou  god fuck this dude. I got mad at him and for the first time ever felt uncomfortable watching an anime. Just why did they even make episode 24 for fucks sake.
Anyway I liked the idea of magic, but incantations are so slow and boring. Wasn't a huge fan of the pointy ears nor the fairy wings. The art wasn't that bad, I thought it would be like REALLY, REALLY, REALLY bad. It wasn't great, but kinda enjoyable. It was a huge bonus to see Suguha  being denied hard and understanding that her love will never become a reality. I laughed a lot in that episode heh.")

I liked the show, I may have shitty taste in anime and am a simpleton and I have no idea what's good. But SAO was enjoyable and am sad that it ended ( I do know about Seaon 2) .

Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. Takes a while to get threw a finish airing show since I'm watching 30 airing anime, and working 60+ hours a week. lol

Just watched the one with the zombies, and kept watching the part where they were beating down the zombie cat while hitting it with dildos and swearing in English.

Hang in there because it gets about twice as good at the 6th episode.

Watched the entirety of [Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon) this week. I've toyed with the idea of watching this for a long time and finally got round to it after looking at the recommendations wiki of this subreddit. I am incredibly glad that I was pointed to it as it was hands down incredible. You know that feeling you get early on in a series where you just think "Damn, this is my shit. This is EXACTLY what I'm looking for!" ? Yeah, that's what I got.

From the second I saw Sentaro tapping on some railings with a couple of sticks I just knew it was going to be good, I'm not really a jazz nut but I enjoy the music and the little of splashes of it that the series used added so much! The [sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNVDcV7ldM8) really build on the characters and you get a really good feeling of their relationships just by seeing them play together, it's so freeing to me to see two people playing and synergizing so well and if feels like you can see them communicating through their music.

The actual bulk of the series is made up more of inter character relationships and drama rather than focusing whole heartedly on the music, I actually prefer it this way. Even though the music was top notch, if it had been used repeatedly it wouldn't have had the same effect that it does by just having short bursts of it every 2-3 episodes. The love polygon they had going on actually kept me guessing for quite some time and some of the results surprised me. That's not to say I didn't like them, I thought the decisions the characters were in keeping with their personalities and generally made sense. As for the characters, I felt they were all well thought out and had strong back stories and interactions with the others. Sentaro was such a god damn bro! Who wouldn't want to be friends with that guy! Everything he did just made me like him more and more.

I don't think I've done this series justice with what I've said but what it amounts to is: This series is fucking awesome and you'd be a damn fool to miss out on it!

**[Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) (62-67)** - With this week Gintama becomes the show I've watched the most episodes of! I don't envision any other series passing it since I think all of the longer ones are shonen action series and it's not really my thing. A decent batch of episodes in all; [more in the weekly thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ed9tj/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_6267/).

---
**[Fate/Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11741/Fate/Zero_2nd_Season) (18-25/25)** - I voiced most of my thoughts on the series last week, but I wrapped it up this week. Saber on a motorcycle is one of my new favorite things in life.

[Fate/Zero](/s "It was interesting seeing Kiritsugu's past and it fit with his decision to destroy the grail after he discovered its true nature, though it still hurt to see Saber on the hill at the end. I ended up caring for Rider and Waver a lot more than I was expecting heading into the series, and even Gilgamesh ended up respecting Waver a bit. I had also forgotten that Kariya Matou and Aoi Tohsaka had a history. That was rough, seeing him break entirely and later Sakura just scolded him as he died.")

Overall, a great action series that has me more than ready to see the new Unlimited Blade Works in a couple months.

**[Toradora](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!) (1-25/25)** - Wanted another romantic series after Fate/Zero, and a comedy doesn't hurt. Ended up marathoning the entire series yesterday and loved it, though I don't think it'll land in my top 5 at this point. Some parallels with Nodame Cantabile that I liked with a messy klutz of a girl getting looked after by the male lead. I enjoyed the premise from the start with them helping each other with their respective crushes. Naturally, they'll fall for each other by the end of the series, right?

I cried as I do with a lot of dramatic series, but in this case it was mainly because of Ryuji's mother Yasuko as their relationship hit close to home near the end. I felt bad for their poor (single) teacher who mostly got used for humor as well. Kawashima made for a welcome shakeup in the group dynamics; definitely some interesting relationships between the lot of them.

[Toradora](/s "I like that Ami ended up maturing as well instead of remaining an adversary or obstacle to overcome. Kushieda was also more complex than I was anticipating and I had a hard time pinning her down much like Takasu. At the beginning of the series I was anticipating her and Kitamura dating to throw Takasu/Aisaka off and open them up to dating each other instead. I was still cheering for her and Takasu up until Taiga realized her feelings for him as well, and I felt terrible for her at the end when she got dumped by both of them.")

A couple of plot lines fell short for me, [Toradora](/s "like Taiga's dad where it felt like I was being jerked around (maybe that was the point, to feel she does whenever he shows up). I still don't like the trope where one of the main couple leaves on a soul-searching journey and only returns in the last few minutes of the final episode. It felt less effective in this instance since they had already started dating before then too.") Still, it had all the hallmarks that I wanted from a school romance and I couldn't stop watching it.
>> ARTICLE
So we're gonna secretly take over these threads by linking the Gintama watch-group threads, right?

> it had all the hallmarks that I wanted from a school romance and I couldn't stop watching it.

I could be wrong but I think that's where the popularity in the show lies. It hits close to center but it does so very effectively when so many of its contemporaries fall short in that regard.

>> ARTICLE

Of course; everyone needs to watch Gintama.

>I could be wrong but I think that's where the popularity in the show lies. It hits close to center but it does so very effectively when so many of its contemporaries fall short in that regard.

Pretty much. With a lot of romances it's easy to screw up something along the way to make you either not care about the main relationship or even dislike the characters, and I could have easily seen that happening with Kawashima's intervention here. It's not incredible in any regard but still executed well.
>> ARTICLE
AM I THE ONLY ONE who wanted [TORADORA SPOILERS](/s "Ryuuji to go with Ami instead of Taiga? I mean.... IDK, I just felt like that would have been better and Taiga and him were like the best couple to be friends instead. Also, I didn't like that Kushieda gave up and was left like that. duh.")
>> ARTICLE
[Toradora, about Ami](/s "I won't disagree with Ryuuji/Ami, but he never really showed much interest in her. If Minori had shut him out much earlier (well before the Christmas Eve party) Ami might have had a chance. She probably was the best choice for him from a logical standpoint and they would have a much more even standing than either Minori or Taiga did with him. Ami was right with the mom/dad/baby thing the trio had going.")

[Toradora, about Minori](/s "I didn't like that Minori gave up either, but I'm not really sure what else she could do by that point since she seemed to care more for Taiga than herself. She says she loved Ryuuji from the very beginning but never acted on it; it seemed like his feelings were obvious to her at the beach house - tortured analogies aside - but at the time it sounded like she had no interest. Did she think even then that it should have been Taiga rather than her? Ami hit the guilt button after the student council president election; when Kitamura confessed to Kano it seemed to be the final blow to him as an option for Taiga, leaving only Ryuuji as the obvious choice for her (smart move on Ami's part to make Minori distance herself). Then Minori remained aloof until Ryuuji was about to confess to her on Christmas Eve, and that was right after she confirmed that Taiga was in love with him so she didn't have much of a choice.")
>> ARTICLE
[Toradora](/s "Taiga leaving at the end of the series wasn't a "soul-searching" thing I don't think, it was her resolving to fix her family situation. She had a definite goal in mind. I actually really liked this part of the ending when I rewatched the series, because it makes total sense: All of Taiga's problems from the beginning of the series and all the immaturity she grows past throughout the show was caused by her broken home life. After seeing Ryuuji accidentally damage and then repair his own home life, it only made sense for her to come full circle and go do the same with her own mother. Leaving without telling anybody was perhaps melodramatic of her, but it allowed Ryuuji to realize she's a strong person of her own and he doesn't need to always be looking after her anymore. He respects her decision even if he doesn't agree with it").

It's a cliche *event*, but I felt it was done for such a solid narrative reason and it was so relevant to the main characters' arcs that it worked really well. Toradora does a lot of that, actually, where it takes cliche romcom scenarios and characters but then puts them in brilliant contexts that make them work well.
>> ARTICLE
Good points. While it does make sense, I just don't like where it's placed in the series. [Toradora](/s "I think it's her sudden disappearance that bothers me more than anything else too. I would have been fine with Taiga ditching her mother rather than trying to repair the relationship as well, but that's just me and probably reflects on the kind of connections I have to my own family.") 
>> ARTICLE
[Toradora](/s "I actually agree, I would have preferred Taiga not disappear so suddenly. As I said, it was pretty melodramatic of her. It would have been a lot more mature to just tell Ryuuji and Yasuko "I want to fix things with my family and I feel confident enough to do that now. I'll be going back home for a semester". They would have been upset, but they'd have supported her, and it would have been a nicer ending").

[Toradora](/s "I also would have been totally okay with an ending in which she never returns to her mother and just moves on, probably for the same reasons as you. I have a great homelife and had a good upbringing, but I don't have strong family ties and family-themed series tend not to resonate with me. It took two watch-throughs of Toradora for me to even notice the family theme in the ending, and the only reason I liked it is because I empathize well with Taiga's character").
>> ARTICLE
I just spent all last week watching Toradora, it was hard not to binge the whole thing in a couple of days. But for some reason the show made me anxious and almost sick to my stomach(not in a bad way, just in a 'some of this shit is too real' kind of way. And after the ending I just went outside and laid down for a couple hours. I don't know why. I don't know why the show hit me so hard. 


Anyway, during the week I would watch a couple episodes usually to finish out an arc, and I always read your write ups from last year, mister Pumpky N. Pye. They served as a way to ground me back to reality and that at the end of the day it's only one show. It's a typical SoL romcom and eventually these feelings of regret and loneliness from my own past will pass. I'm rambling, I just wanted to say thanks. 

Thank you, sincerely. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, it is a SoL romcom, but "typical" I don't know :P

It's definitely one of those shows that just sucks you in and convinces you these are real people, and if you relate to it on a personal level it's even moreso, I'm sure.

In any case, I'm glad you got something out of my writeups. Thanks for reading!

I still wonder what the "N" in "Pumpy N. Pye" stands for...

Spice and Wolf I and the OVA. So very good.

**Mawaru Penguindrum (16-24)**

Well this was a mindblow. Probably one of the densest series I've seen, with layers and layers added to pretty much every aspect of the show after every episode. There's no way I caught even half of the subtext. Loved the execution of the series, with flashbacks, both metaphorical and literal (or maybe both simultaneously?) adding depth and connecting seemingly disparate ideas and people that were there from the beginning. Other people have written more eloquently about this series so I'll just leave it at that.

**Sword Art Online (1-25)**

I read the manga, one of them at least, a while ago, and it was awful. But it was an adaptation of an adaptation, so I figured I'd check out the show when in the mood for some junk food shows. I went in with low expectations from both the crappy, crappy manga and from seeing others talk about it. Partly because of this, it was a lot more enjoyable than I expected. 

It was just plain fun, if you ignore the cardboard cutout characters with questionable motivations, weird pacing (I seem to find pacing issues with almost every big series...), random plot devices and deus ex machina. That seems a little critical considering I already said I enjoyed it, but critically, it was a mess. The characters were what I had the most issues with, because honestly, the background art was good enough to sell me on the world even if it was kind of shallow in the end. 

But the characters consistently fell flat. Kirito is undeniably (seriously, is this even up for debate? I honestly want to know because I haven't taken part) a Gary Stu/wish-fulfillment character and actual VRMMORPG Jesus/Neo ([SAO](/s "he literally wins by bypassing the code of the game in BOTH Aincrad and ALO arcs.")), as well as causing every girl he meets to fall in love with him upon first meeting. Asuna was alright, up until the point where she decides that the meaning of her life is *to exist for Kirito,* and [SAO](/s "threatens to commit suicide if Kirito dies.") Seriously what the fuck. And Suguha's entire character motivation makes absolutely no sense. I was hoping the villain might be at least compelling but both were pretty bad, with Sugou just being a caricature. I guess Akihito still has room for development, but I'm not expecting much. 

Characters I liked: Klein was a total bro. I also liked the Lizbeth episode. 

I see why people say the ALO arc is completely superfluous now. It seems like the author was going for developing Suguha as a character, but it failed miserably to offer any depth beyond her (not blood related so it's ok) brocon. Plus it was the nail in the coffin on Asuna's damsel in distress status.  

SAO II looks so far to have improved upon nearly everything in SAO, though character development is still the weakest. With all that said, I still enjoyed it, but the flaws were glaring enough for me to want to rant. 

**Kyoukai no Kanata (1-12)**

Another one I went in with low expectations from mixed reviews. Was better than the bad reviews made it out to be. The plot was a bit all over the place, and the ending was not one, but *two* asspulls in rapid succession, but other than that it was entertaining. The production value is killer (awwyiss KyoAni), so the fight animations were great. Characters were... ok? It felt like the show spent way too much time on each character's running gag, to the point where it sacrificed screentime for actual development. Part of this is to blame on the schizophrenic shifts in tone between serious business and misplaced comedy. Overall, could have been better, more well organized and focused, but an enjoyable experience. Just don't expect anything ground-breaking.

**Accel World (1-5)**

Man that MC has issues. Actual serious issues. I've read that his character design is how he views himself and not how other people see him, and that's an interesting choice. I've only seen the first arc, but hopefully he'll be able to start getting past his inferiority complex and depression at least a little bit. I've seen some hate on the character for being weak, whiny, etc, when he actually has power/agency (as shown in episode 5) at least in the game world, but from what I've seen, he has some deep-rooted psychological issues that cause a disconnect between reality and what he sees. I'm interested in where this will go. 

**Ping Pong the Animation (1-11)**

This show was amazing, perfect even. The only other show that gave me a similar feeling upon completion is probably the Tatami Galaxy (same director, go figure). Everything just meshed together perfectly to make a great show with real characters that felt like real people facing real problems. Every character is so well-developed, even the nameless guy who went soul-searching after the second or third episode. The show is goddamn art. The OP is kickass too. 

In the manga department, I found out **Negima**! has a sequel (**UQ Holder**) and flipped my shit so I read that. Also read **Assassination Classroom**, which is waaay better than the premise makes it out to be. 

Edit: Forgot **Hanamonogatari** somehow. 

Seeing as Monogatari is my favorite series, it's no surprise that I liked Hana. I feel like Kanbaru didn't get as much screentime/development as the other heroines, and Hana definitely made up for that and more. Every arc of Second Season has been amazing, Hana being no exception. Kaiki meat fanservice was A++ too. And that sound Kanbaru makes when she whimpers. And ponytail Kanbaru. There were some spectacular stills too, as usual. Overall, another excellent installment to an excellent series. Now the wait begins for Kizu and S3.

**[Mahoraba: Heartful days](http://myanimelist.net/anime/519/Mahoraba:_Heartful_days)** (Re-watch **6/26**)

After many years I've decided to revisit this show which is one of my all time favorites and for now it is still enjoyable as I remember it.

There is something about an apartment building settings with a bunch of quirky/odds characters living together (more recent example would be [Kawaiso](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21405/Bokura_wa_Minna_Kawaisou)) that is just enjoyable.

>> ARTICLE
I haven't heard of Mahoraba before; it looks interesting so I'll add it to my list to eventually get to.

I marathoned through [Dusk Maiden of Amnesia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12445/Tasogare_Otome_x_Amnesia) yesterday. I picked it at random pretty much with no recommendation.

I really loved it, a very pleasant surprise. It did try to juggle being comedic and suspenseful through-out but I found that it usually hit the mark with whatever it was doing. It made me smile when it was trying to be funny and it genuinely sent a chill down my back when the lights went out.

The standout aspect of the show though was the interesting use of colors and image transitions. It reminded me a lot of the Monogatari series in that way, but not enough where it felt like it was trying to copy. I'd recommend it for that alone.

On the negative side however, I'd thought they wasted a bit of potential when it came to the two supports, Momoe Okonogi and Kirie Kanoe. There were a couple episodes where the spotlight was put on them to good effect, but outside of that they were left out to dry. I was really hoping at some point Momeo [.](/s "would also be able to see Yuuko, alongside Kirie and Teiichi, but alas that never happened."). Though I'll simply attribute this to the series lenth. In the end though, I did enjoy the time they got, and they were certainly treated better than the supports of some other series.

It's a short one so I was able to finish it in a day, and it ends with a satisfying conclusion. Which was a welcome change from some others that I have finished lately.

Hello once again! I missed last week discussion so today my post will be fairly long. Anyway, lets get started!

> **[Gintama: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15335/Gintama:_Kanketsu-hen_-_Yorozuya_yo_Eien_Nare)**  **Rating: gintama/10**

[Keeping it short](/s "All good things will eventually come to end, sadly, Gintama is no exception. But what an end it was. Gintama managed to tell potent time travelling story and stay true to the series ideals. It was glorious, touching, funny and breathtaking as always. There is nothing more I can say about Gintama  it is an amazing show that I would recommend to anyone who likes anime. As for me well, there is still a little hope that we will have more Gintama some time in future, but well see. I predict Gintama-depressions will start in several months, but hell, it would a great excuse to rewatch some superb arcs.")

> **[Shoujo Kakumei Utena (Revolutionary Girl Utena)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/440/Shoujo_Kakumei_Utena)** - **Rating: 5.8/10**

I feel that this anime needs detailed analysis, so it will be slightly longer than usual and in several paragraphs.

[Psychological anime and me](/s "First things first  I did not like this anime. I had fairly high expectations from Revolutionary Girl Utena {RGU}. Well, I like psychological shows just for them being psychological  not sure that I will like the show, but it will be at least interesting and provide something new, not your usual high school comedy stuff. Serial Experiments Lain and NGE are the shows that I enjoyed a lot while Kaiba was a series that I find to be pretentious and wasting its potential, so it depends. Sadly RGU belongs to the second category.")

[The concept and idea](/s "The idea of this show is rather ordinary  it is a show about princes. Princes are no strangers in the world of shoujo and RGU is some kind of deconstruction here. This anime displays us an obvious yet interesting thing  prince is someone who only lives in your head, in your imagination. There are no princes in the real world, everyone creates them by themselves. And, well, each character had some kind of prince. This story about these internal and external struggles which our heroes face throughout the anime. Whats real in your prince and whats your imagination? When love ends and lust, worship begins? What do you value the most  friendship, duty or still love? RGU makes you think about all these questions with the help of interesting, disturbing characters with haunting past. This is where  concept, idea, making you ask and think  the show excels, however this anime has many problems.")

[Problems with tone and pacing](/s "Psychological anime need to be confusing and somewhat weird to get your interest and to make you wonder. However, RGU must be one of the most misleading series Ive ever seen {and I had no problems with understanding aforementioned Serial Experiments Lain or FLCL}. The show started slow and it was expected, but it never made a run. For an easy concept like this it was painfully slow  you can cut entire series in a half and dont lose much. Sometimes the show had severe problems with its identity and slide into a blatant comedy {I talk about Nanamis episodes with curry, cowbell and egg}  it ruined already subpar atmosphere of the anime. It was not needed, we could live without these episodes. Ah, and recaps. RGU had too much unnecessary, redundant stuff that added nothing to main themes/plot and just damaged its pacing.")

[Logic and common sense](/s "But what I hated the most is probably the main plot, the main execution of the pretty good idea. I felt that the logic had left RGU even before first episode started. Why do Students Council fight? Ok, they want to gain the power to revolutionize the world. I mean, what? They dont even know what does it mean! Hell, even Akio himself doesnt know it. Were there any reasons why these very students were chosen to fight for Rose Bride and not, for example, Wakaba? And what got me the most  only in 33 or so episode Students Council asked themselves: Who the hell is the End of the World? I mean, they had fought so many times for something they dont even understand and for a man they dont even know? I no longer wonder why these characters have psychological problems  they have serious problems with common sense too. Thats why I did not believe this anime and was not moved at all. It was too unrealistic and far-fetched to believe in. Himemiya being an anti-hero (well, shes not technically an anti-hero, but still) was obvious from the first episode yet Utena was blind for entire period of anime. Meh. Almost every single episode was strictly structured: introduction of a duelist, his struggles, duel and inevitable loss. After a while it felt boring and repetitive or even uninspiring. Though Nanamis tragedy was rather interesting, I admit.")

[Regarding visuals](/s "I heard from many people that this show aged poorly. Well, they were right. The show that is meant to be artsy and beautiful in 1997 looks weird in 2014 {though SEL still looks clean and Cowboy Bebop is handsome as always}. If the show was made recently with the help of some good studio then maybe perception would be clearer. Also I cannot avoid topic of repeating scenes. Fine, show me two, three times how Utena goes into the battle, but ten? I know, reduction of production costs and such, but still, I felt it was super lazy and even impudent.")

[Utena and Madoka: my take](/s "These two anime are often compared and I can see why. Yes, you can say that PMMM is a rip-off of RGU  both girls start as nave creatures, make some kind of contact, mature, suffer and eventually sacrifice themselves for the better. But PMMM is much clearer in its message, events start in the 3rd episode and after that we see the downward spiral of girls lives and endless suffering while RGU makes it slow, takes many unnecessary things and have x3 amount of episodes. RGU takes a slow approach and a hard way. Why? I dont know. Hell, Kyubey at least fulfilled the wish immediately and we can see the reason why girls made contract with him. Why students in RGU accepted their fate as duelists is still a puzzle. For an illusory opportunity of revolution? I dont know. In the end, you can say that PMMM is a more casual anime, and that would be true. But who said that being causal is something bad when the show excels at its message and ways to deliver this message?")

[Final thoughts](/s "Well, I was disappointed. Did I enjoy this anime? No. Do I regret watching it? Also no. It is still a valuable and interesting anime experience. I can see why people love it, but I did not dig it  I think that the idea was good, but execution left much to be desired. Well, it happens. Though Im a bit worried about Mawaru Penguindrum now")

[P.S.](/s "Female friend of mine recently called me prince. I should have been grateful for that, but in reality I freaked for a second or two. So RGU worked, I guess?..")

> **[Uchouten Kazoku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17909/Uchouten_Kazoku)** - **Rating: 6.6/10**

[Intro](/s "I heard a lot of good things about this anime, for example, that this show is one of the best from 2013 and many compared it to Kyousougiga, which I enjoyed greatly. Maybe thats where the trap was waiting for me. I expected well, something different, but in fact UK is a generic slice of life show with a bit of fantasy and with focus on family.")

[Characters and plot](/s "Slice of life is all about characters. If you like them, then you will turn a blind eye to every single shortcoming of the anime, but if you dont, then slice of life would be nothing but boring and uninspiring experience. Unfortunately, UK was a latter case for me. Somehow I felt completely disconnected from the characters. Yes, they were here, yes, they had pretty interesting stories and personalities, but I was not moved. I did not feel for characters and their problems. Themes of the show were right, idea was really good, so problem with execution? Maybe. Most interesting character, Benten, after great sixth episode {highlight of the show} was forgotten in dust. Akadama was your generic grouchy old man. Family was interesting enough, but there was no standout, nothing that could break this family from any others. No spice, if you want. Maybe this show is not about it, maybe. Some family, some story nothing more. Plot was here, but thats all I can say about it  it was slow-paced and predictable, but thats hardly a drawback in a slice of life series.")

[Music and visuals](/s "But technical part of UK was really good. This anime looks beautiful and has peculiar charm. Characters designs are also done very well  they all look different and easy to remember. Also this show has pretty solid soundtrack, I liked most of BGM and I skipped opening only two or three times which is a good number for me. Seiyu also did their job quite well.")

[Expectation is an evil thing](/s "Overall I think that Uchouten Kazoku is a really good series, but just not for me. Probably because while watching it I always compared it to Kyousougiga, unintentionally, of course, but still, and did not get what I had expected in first place and it affected my perception. It did not make me cry, it did not make me think about my life. Could this anime be better? I think, yes, if after sixth episode it took slightly different approach with more focus on present and not mistakes of past. Also I felt that the world was left unexplored and unexplained (of course it shouldnt be the focus of slice of life, but more slightly more information about tengi-tanuki-humans interactions would be appreciated). But it did what it did. If many people enjoyed it then probably it was for good.")
>> ARTICLE
> **[Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo (The Girl Who Leapt Through Time)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2236/Toki_wo_Kakeru_Shoujo)** - **Rating: 8.2/10**

[Intro: movies and me](/s "To be honest, I usually dont like movies. I feel like story cannot be fully told in 90-120 minutes and that characters are often blank and one-dimensional. This is a consequence of me being used to slow pacing of majority of anime series. Thats why I avoid watching movies and pick them up only if I have around two hours of spare time. Good thing that Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo managed to elude downfalls and tells complete story with a cast of great characters.")

[Leaping a bit further](/s "Time travel is a common theme in anime world and Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo tells us one more story about it. Plot is itself rather straightforward, but executed very well  the show has almost zero plot holes and problems with common sense and logic. Ending is also bittersweet and adds certain charm to overall atmosphere. Talking about atmosphere, it is amazing. Anime takes itself half funny/half seriously, and it helps establish good tone and overall feel with this show. Because of it drama is not forced and feels natural, characters struggles are real and moving. Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo has nice pacing and explains everything very well, so no questions left unanswered. What I also liked is this anime is that is tells you just enough and never declines into vulgarity or stupidity.")

[The Girl Who Leapt Over Everyone](/s "Characters are probably a highlight of the show with Makoto Konno being its main star. Shes probably one of the best female leads Ive seen in a very long time  realistic, a bit childish but determined, strong-willed and sincere. This anime could not get better main character. Her friends, Chiaki and Kousuke, are simple characters, but it only increases realistic part of the show and establishes bond between them and viewers. They all have their feelings, problems, goals and feel like real people. I grew attached to them and it was really sad to let them go.")

[Back to the future](/s "Visuals and music, well, cannot say much about them  they were here. Just want to note that the animation was fluid and Makotos seiyu did amazing work. Overall, it was a very good show that fully met my expectations. Time travel that executed great and has believable characters? Well, thats what we have in Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo, a show that I can recommend to almost anyone.")

> **[Mind Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/875/Mind_Game)** - **Rating: 9.0/10**

[Masaaki Yuasa, his works and me](/s "Yuasa is a genius without any doubt. His works are unique, recognizable and make you perceive anime in unusual ways. Hes the figure on anime scene. But I have difficult stories with his works. The Tatami Galaxy is one of my favorite shows of all time and if you read this, you probably know how great this anime is. However, I cannot say that I enjoyed Kaiba that much. I thought it could be better in almost every aspect and consider it as a solid, but not groundbreaking anime. Recent Ping Pong the Animation was okay, but nothing more, I thought that the story was too straightforward and that Yuasa should not waste his time and talent on a generic slice of life. So I approached Mind Game with a caution. It could hit hard or be another disappointment. Luckily, it was the first case.")

[Quick plot/characters notes](/s "As with The Tatami Galaxy, Mind Game doesnt have innovative plot or idea: live your life is a common theme in anime. But the way how this thought is presented and executed is what makes Mind Game so stunning. Plot is largely linear, but it only helps with shows integrality. Many actions occur only in Nishis {main character} head and it helps us to see his doubts, feelings, thoughts which is, again, a simple idea, but executed perfectly. Oh, and the characters. Many characters and main heroes in 25+ episodes shows dont receive that much insight and growth as characters in Mind Game. They have simple stories, simple lives, simple dramas  yet again they are touching and sincere and are shown in all surrealistic beauty.")

[Surrealism for everyone!](/s "All Yuasas works have strong surrealistic feel in it, and Mind Game is no exception. Visual part of the show is fantastic and definitely something that you can call unique. Faces of real actors that are sometimes placed instead of actual faces of the characters is something that Ive never seen before in any show. Wild color spectrum, strange angles, seemingly random frames  everything works in Mind Game to show you how beautiful and interesting is the world around us and, most importantly, in you. I also want to draw attention to the work of seiyu. They are not professionals {you can tell it from their profiles in MAL}, and maybe thats why they did stellar job in voicing characters. Their voices sound naturally and without overacting.") And, of course, the final song. [Its beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNTlLMb0fiw).

[Final thoughts](/s "Mind Game is an outstanding anime and it is really hard to review it, its better to experience yourself. This anime is about will to live and unlimited optimism which is presented in a bizarre and truly unique way. Of course this anime is not for everyone, as with all Yuasas shows, but Im happy I had pleasure watching this. One of the best movies out there.")

[P.S.](/s "Oh, and image of God was rather interesting here is well. Check it out.")

So yeah, thats all for these two weeks! I dont have any particular anime plans at the moment (maybe I will rewatch the [second season of Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17074/Monogatari_Series:_Second_Season) and pick up [Hanamonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21855/Hanamonogatari), I dont know), well see after I get bored of new Path of Exile season. 

Thanks for reading, watch only good shows and see you soon!

**True Tears 13/13**  
I started watching this because I read somewhere that the ending was somewhat controversial.  
It was okay, neither great or bad, and the ending only depends on [](/s "which girl you prefer").  
**7/10**  
  
**Hanamonogatari 5/5**  
I enjoyed watching some more Kanbaru, but yet I'm not totally satisfied. Maybe it's because we didn't see many of the characters, or because there's still a lot of things missing from the story (since Hana is supposed to be the last arc chronologically).  
Because of that, Hana feels like a spin-off of the serie (at least to me)  
**7.8/10**  
  
**Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt 13/13**  
I'm not sure how to rate this.  It does exactly what you expect it to do. Stupid yet entertaining.  
But seriously, the last 2 minutes were some high level trolling.  
  
**Kore wa zombie desu ka? 13/13**  
This one does a good job to mix comedy, action and drama, yet is full of the biggest clichs. But I enjoyed it.  
**7/10**  
>> ARTICLE
[Princess Tutu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/721/Princess_Tutu) (22/26 DVD version, of course.) Wow. I did not expect a show named Princess Tutu to actually be this good. Looks like from here on out it's going to fuck with my mind and possibly go down the tragic route. I am not prepared, but I plan to finish it today.

The development is solid, the world is solid, the music is pretty rad and most likely taken from various ballets. Subjectively, the characters are very likable, and it's just generally a fun show to watch. I really like the fact that it's built around fairytales. Depending on how the ending plays out, I might rate it 8 or 9.

EDIT

26/26 [](/s " I WAS NOT PREPARED. FUCK. What a great ending. What a great show. I cried.")

[HAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=16528) (1/1) I rated it a 5, but I changed it to a 4. It's bland, a sci-fi movie that barely deserves the title. The characters were dry. The plot twist made the earlier parts at least seem somewhat inconsistent, and I feel like it avoided a lot plot points. I felt sad, but it was more of a forced sadness like the sort that KEY shows try to invoke but worse.  

[Monogatari Series Second Season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17074/Monogatari_Series:_Second_Season). Solid 8 based on what I caught up on. I watched the recap episodes (for Bake/Nise/Neko) because I put it on-hold around 15 of SS, and then watched the episodes from there on. The last arc was awesome. I won't explain any further, because everything I would say has already been said. And, yes, Kaiki is best girl.


>> ARTICLE
I finished Yuyushiki, and immediately started watching it again. There really isn't a good way to defend or explain why I love the show as much as I do, because it is a little generic. Typical slice of life show about girls in school. But there is something about the art, simple (albeit iconic music), the ed that changes every episode, and comedic timing that really puts it at the top of my favorite show list. 

If you guys liked yuruyuri, it features two of the seiyuu from yuruyuri.

If you are a fan of slice of life, give it a shot. It is a single season with twelve episodes.

Yeah, can't be helped. It's still surprising how he changed from a scared boy to a murder machine just in 1 episode (however, once a pussy, always a pussy, even though I can understand how he feels, being thrown into a game he didn't want to). Luckily, the show had that one amazing character called Yuno (let's also not forget Minene) who made this show a pleasant thing to watch.

**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS** (15/26) : Just before the point where everything goes south, so it makes sense that the last two episodes (14 and 15) would focus on Vivio. Always interesting to see the difference in personality between Nanoha and Fate- Nanoha's more towards letting others learn things by themselves, while Fate likes to help them learn. Also, Episode 15 is where Mariel originally debuted (in the 2nd A's movie, she plays the role of the engineer tasked with Repairing Raising Heart and Bardiche after they were damaged)- also [her reaction realising the implications of Vivio being Nanoha and Fate's daughter](http://i.minus.com/im4LHRMjkg5jP.png)- always amusing.

[Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=145)

Debuted in 1998-1999.

Overall I found it to be a very nice romantic comedy with a decent story line about a couple dealing with troubles in high school. 

The ending was kind of a let down, but I found the character interactions to be hilarious and interesting to witness.

>> ARTICLE
Finished watching **Nichijou**. Easily in my top 3, behing NGE and TTGL. I thought the humour was great, the artstyle was charming and the animation was sublime. Loved this show, dunno much about how it did in Japan but I'm hoping for a season 2.

**10/10**

Can I include anime movies? Becuase I watched the Rebuilds of Evangelion. I went into them blind for the most part.

**Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone**

Not much to say about this one. Pretty similar to NGE with a way higher budget. Rami-chan looked great in CGI if you ask me, loved all the transformations she had. Characters feel different to NGE, didn't like them as much but, eh, it's a movie they have to make cuts.

**8/10**

**Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance**

The fuck was this shit. Honestly didn't enjoy this at all, maybe I'm bitter because my mom walked in on that scene where Asuka gets scared by Penpen, but I just felt like it took a massive dump on NGE. All the scenes it changed were changed for the worse if you ask me. [Eva 2.0 and NGE spoilers](/s "The scene with the dummy plug didn't have the same impact as the original. Shinji being blindfolded removed a lot of the impact from the scene for me, as did making Asuka the pilot instead of Toji. The changes made to the beserk mode fight against Zereul were terrible too. That scene was what made me think of the Eva's as something dangerous and powerful as all fuck. Eva-01 was monstrous, and it's roar and behaviour reflected this. I have yet to see something unnerve me more than the scene of Eva-01 crawling across the forest to get to Zereuls corpse to ingest the S2 organ. In the rebuilds it was all halos and flashy CGI spirit arms and fucking lasers and explosions. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was cool, but it completely pales in comparison to the original. One extra scene I did like was Mari forcing Eva-02 into beast mode. It was pretty cool.")

Also, the new angel desgins are just downright horrible. A fucking walking clock? Whatever the fuck that thing was at the start? Seriously, the just look incredibly dumb. And Mari just feels so out of place, I absolutely despise her. The characters just feel hollow, compared to the originals they are hollowier than the Geofront but even on their own they just feel bland. I hated Shinji, Asuka, Misato and Gendo in this and yet they're some of my favourite characters in fiction in NGE.

Overall, it's like a **6/10** at best.

**Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo**

How the goddamn hell is this lower rated on IMBD than 1.0 and 2.0? Seriously, I loved this! It didn't give me that vibe that Eva 2.0 did, it wasn't trying to imitate NGE, it was trying to be itself and I just loved it. The [Eva 3.0](/s "timeskip") was the best part of the movie, I didn't feel like it removed any of the character development, heck I didn't even feel any character development in 1.0 or 2.0. Kaworu and Shinji's relationship in this is great, it really mad the movie. The music is sublime, I just love everything about the soundtrack. I was okay with the crazy action scenes in this movie even though I wasn't in 2.0 because, as I said, I felt like it was trying to be different from NGE and distance itself from it. The Eva desgins weren't that great though. I liked Eva-13 and Mark-06 but that's about it. The visuals were great and I just loved this movie. I feel like something great is coming up in 4.0. Can't wait.

Sidenote, [Eva 3.0](/s "Eva 02-Dash beast mode is the most retarded thing I've ever seen. Why the fuck does it turn into a cat? Also the Mass Production Evangelions from the preview look shockingly bad compared to the original ones, plus that Eva 02+08 just looks dumb. I'm hoping not of it appears in the next movie much like the preview for 3.0 in 2.0.") Also, the track 'Tout Est Perplexe' sounds like the Great Fairy Fountain music in Ocarina of Time.


**9/10**

Started watching another series 2 days ago, it's called **za no gmu/**. I'm 2 episodes into Season 1. I'm so suprised that I haven't seen anyone mention it around here ever. The animation quality is so high the damn thing looks real! I really like the setting. I'm very interested in the Shiro Hok-sha and what their deal is.

**Ojamajo Doremi 20-39:** There have been a few standout episodes so far. The kidnapping episode, magical Pop, the one where Doremi loses her Tap, etc. More than a few, I guess. The episodes that are either strong on drama or comedy seem to be the best, but those that tread the middle ground can get boring.

The girls seem like quite static characters still, even though more than 30 episodes have passed. Slowly we're seeing more of their personalities (like Hazuki enjoying bad jokes, for example), but they don't appear to have actually changed at all. Which is at odds with what I was expecting. I'm not sure if I came in with false assumptions as to what the anime was about.

The good episodes are like Heartcatch Precure's episodes that involve random people, but they work a lot better because of the format. They aren't forced to fight any monsters, and the magic they can do opens up a lot of possiblities. That's good, at least.


**Kemono no Souja Erin 25-50:** My thoughts on this haven't changed much since last week. I'm still shocked at the number of 10/10s and the generally high rating and praise this has recieved just about everywhere.

It peaked near the middle of the series [when Lilan and Erin fly for the first time.](/spoiler) That was one of the few moments where everything just worked - the insert song, visuals, and sound all came together to effectively conclude an arc. After that, the uninteresting politics became the focus.

The subterfuge and backstabbing looked like it was trying to have a mystery aspect to it (where viewers would be wondering who was behind things), but everything was obvious. The involved characters were poorly fleshed out (particularly Ngan and Shunan), even with the multiple episodes they had dedicated to them. 

The worst and biggest flaw with *Erin* lies in the direction. The pacing is horrible, and I get the impression that everything could have been condensed into 3 or even 2 cours. Many episodes go by with nothing happening, where you'd expect the characters to grow. But that doesn't happen either, because actual changes in the characters only occur at pivotal moments in the story. Even within the episodes the pacing is bad: by the last cour between 10 and 20 percent of the content of the episodes was composed of recaps or flashbacks. Whenever anybody would mention anything that had ever been shown to us before, we'd see it again. Sometimes multiple times in the same episode. Practically every other episode we hear the tale of how the kingdom was founded, which just seems like a way of padding out an extra minute or so.

Whoever was responsible for the insert songs and their placement had no idea what they were doing. I mentioned that they can work well, and they sometimes did. The problem is that the 5-ish songs were played constantly (sometimes more than 2 per episode), and only rarely did they actually fit the mood. 

It wasn't all bad, however. I liked the world. There was a clear effort to create some kind of history and mythology, and the tales were interpreted in different ways by the factions in the story. Quite a bit of thought went into the mechanics of the Touda and Beast-lords, and I certainly enjoyed this aspect of it. The sound of the Beast-lords was magnificent, and thankfully somebody had the foresight to use their screeches sparingly.  I liked seeing Erin's progression thoughout the show, and her bonding with Lilan was my favourite part. She seemed a bit too idealistic though, and the message behind the anime came across a bit too strongly.

I really wanted to like this after what I saw last week, but it just didn't pick up. It's an okay story, an interesting setting, and a good character all being brought down by the director. The problems I had with it meant that often I just couldn't care about what was going on, and I was kept watching only with the hope that good things will happen. After looking into the source novels a bit, it seems that most of the problems lie in the adaptation. The things they did to make it more appealing to children really dumbed it down.

**Smile Precure 18-21:** I'm not sure why I stopped watching this, because it's a lot of fun. There isn't any drama, and the villian setup means that all the focus is on the main girls. It's years ahead of Dokidoki and HaCha in terms of production values, too. What happened to Toei in the last couple of years?

I've been rocking and rolling through Magi. I'm almost done with season 1, and I plan to hop right into season 2. I've been really enjoying it a lot. With the exception of the first opening the soundtrack is amazing, the animation looks nice, and the characters feel solid and well done. Would recommend it if you're a fan of shows like FMA: Brotherhood, Soul Eater, or Fate/Zero.

**Monster** 7/74  
I'm on my 3rd year on Med school, so the hospital routine seems pretty interesting, but I have a feeling that it won't be much relevant to the show from now on. So far I liked it a lot, but it is kinda too sad for what I'm looking for. I put it on hold, and might actually drop it if the rumours about Del Touro adapting it with HBO confirm.

**Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood** 46/64 - Rewatch  
I watched it loosely while it was being aired, mainly because I was also reading the manga. So I decided to rewatch now. I know I was looking for something to cheer up and FMA has some pretty sad moments, but still I think it is happy. I remember most plot points, deaths and so on, so I didn't have surprises. Still, even before the sad scenes happened (heck, more than one episode before it happened) I had teary eyes. I don't know what happened to me lately, things apparently are getting to me more easily, I might be getting softer.


>> ARTICLE
These rumours about the HBO version are pretty old, and as far as I know there were no updates since it all started, so I wouldn't wait for it if I were you.

And FYI, the series are really dense and slow, but really rewarding after you finish it. The last episodes are awesome, one of my favorite series for sure.

Well, Game of Thrones was announced in 2007 and it only began airing in 2010, so 3 years. And it was well worth the wait.

And given that there is a [10 days old news about Del Toro/HBO/Monster](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/08/14/guillermo-del-toro-mentions-monster-adaptation-in-sugoi-japan-endorsement), I'll keep my hopes up at least for a while. I agree that it the anime is very good from what I've seen, but I think that in the live action format it might be even better and worth the wait for a while at least.

**[Hunter x Hunter 2011](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_\(2011\)): 1-21/148.** *I pretty much binged watched the entire Hunter Exam arc.*

After seeing this subreddit talk about this being one of the better shounens, I finally got around to watching it. Not anything amazing yet, but it was pretty solid and set up a very fascinating universe.
I'm really enjoying Gon's positive and refreshing personality--a trait I rarely see in many shounen protagonists. I'm also loving the importance on skills and individual attributes to assess one's abilities. I'm pretty sure I haven't gotten to the best of it yet so I'll be sticking around.

**[Monogatari Series: Second Season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17074/Monogatari_Series:_Second_Season)**  
8/10. Weaker than I thought it would be but still great. It also contained my favorite part of the whole Monogatari series yet, [ep 20](/s "Mayoi's farewell moment"). I cried.

**[Kokoro Connect](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11887/Kokoro_Connect)** / **[Kokoro Connect: Michi Random](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16001/Kokoro_Connect:_Michi_Random)**  
8/10. I fell prey to the Himeko Inaba hype, [she rules](http://i.imgur.com/c638cM0.gif). I think the show got to be a bit too melodramatic at times but on the whole I enjoyed it and it had a great ending with the OVA's. Or at least a really pleasing ending!

**[Mahou Shoujo MadokaMagica](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica)**  
7/10. I never felt like the show fully grabbed me. It was a lot darker than I expected! Not sure if I should watch the movies but I may eventually.

**[B Gata H Kei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7817/B_Gata_H_Kei)** (1-8/12)  
7/10 (so far). I'm actually enjoying this quite a bit but I just can't justify giving it too high of a score because it's just full of tropes and cheesiness. But ultimately it's about how much you enjoy a show, right? So I'd recommend it!

**[Gintama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) (62-67/201)**


Discussion thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ed9tj/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_6267/). 
	

**[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass) (15-22/22)**


Brutal. Dense. Strangely uplifting given the events leading up to the finale. 

[Some half-baked thoughts](/s "Admittedly I was a little worried what direction the series would take after Shogos initial capture, where the criminally asymptotic belong in a society under Sibyls governance, how Akane would come to term with her ideological struggles on law, its administration, and its attitude towards the populace, how we could possibly see Japan mended when the only solution offered was to destroy and rebuild. The show established a great amount of ground to cover and went about it in a satisfying way. I grew to love pretty much everyone on screen regardless of what side of the field they were on. Seeing Akane grow into her own and bring things back full circle in the final scenes, Shogo incite panic and reject Sibyl so forcibly only to be done in by a rogue Kogami, Ginoza walk the path of his father after putting so much effort into avoiding that fate, Sibyl itself recognize that a system is prone to irregularities no matter how robust its design. A lot of good stuff. Nuff said.")


**Recommendation:**  Solid show. Worth checking out if you enjoy police procedurals in cyberpunk settings. It can be heavy-handed in how it poses its questions to the viewer, often directly quoting from or referencing a slew of novels or philosophers, but Id rather have a show point me to supplementary readings and challenge me with its ideas than say little to nothing at all (see below). Bring on season 2!


**[Shuffle!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/79/Shuffle!) (13-24/24)**


My apologies for writing way too much on this last week. Ill keep it brief here.


[Comments on the second act](/s "So as Ive seen hinted, there was a shift in tone after the sub-mediocre harem romp that was the first half. However, it can be difficult to sink your teeth into anything more serious in nature when its foundations didnt do anything to lure me in. A lot of moping around. Backstories that service the drama more than the characters, Sia being the worst offender. If I can give credit to anything, its that the series has a generally agreeable conclusion after some actual progression, which is more than enough to make me take notice amongst its contemporaries.")

[Comments on the denouement](/s "Not really where I wanted to see things end up. I had assumed the show evolved past all of the typical harem antics and that Nerine and Sia were moving on with their lives. Getting another dose of this just reminds me that the first half exists.")


**Recommendation:** Avoid. That being said, I hate to leave things in such a negative place, so here are some counterarguments and opposing viewpoints:

**[Death Note](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note) (13-24/37)**


So can we all agree that Lights dad is just the worst thing ever? Any character that speaks in clichs has no real offerings in the grand scheme of things. Shit, Im being negative again. How about that second OP? Heavy music in anime openings is more than a welcome change of pace in my book.


[](/s "I could have done without all of focus on the police drama. None of it was interesting and did little other than pad the episode count. I was also a little hesitant on the Yotsuba shenanigans until it was all tied back together, but man was there a lot of downtime with the investigation team during this arc. Thank whatever deity that Misa grew to be useful because she was giving Chief Yagami competition with her annoyance.")


[Episode 24](/s "Ever since Light and Misa forfeited their powers, of course I was anticipating those powers to be returned, and man did they do a good job hyping that up. Legitimately excited that Kira is back within Light and the cat and mouse game between him and L has begun again on a different footing of Kiras design.")

>> ARTICLE
If you watched Death Note until ep. 24 take my advice: WATCH EP 25 and drop it there! It's just my opinion, but the anime turns to sh*t after that

Edit: added EP 25 recommendation. Prepare yourself!

Full disclosure: I knew quite a lot of the general consensus of the show before going in. I started watching after a relative ranted to me about it, letting a little too much information slip out in the process. Thanks for the heads up though!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for linking my post, that's pretty cool!

But unfortunately I've since changed my mind on Shuffle: It's pretty bad, and I don't recommend it either. I still believe everything I wrote last November is true, but I think I was downplaying the show's weaknesses and playing up its strengths. The characters are pretty much all awful, with even its best character (Asa) being solid...but generic and uninteresting. Hell, the next-best character after Asa was Mayumi, a support character who gets virtually no screen time and no arc, which says something about the rest of the main cast. In a show like this, the characters are just so important that this can't be ignored.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely! Your post did well with balancing out my thoughts and any existing dialog out there is relevant to whatever crap I spew, so that should hopefully enrich the discussions we have here.

Agreed on all points. Glad to know others out there enjoyed Asa and Mayumi. Shame that everyone else isn't up to their level. I know that I came across harsh when talking about this show, but there were some things that I did genuinely like, which is why I decided to link to other content.

I finished off Kyoukai no Kanata. I actually really really like the show. The twist at the end [Kyoukai no Kanata](/s "that Mirai was actually there to assassinate Akihiko and becoming friends with him was a mistake") was rather hugely surprising and actually went a long way towards explaining things. Though [Kyoukai no Kanata](/s "I still don't understand how she lived through the final battle. It seemed like she was dead, but then just kind of...showed up. They could have explained it via her blood still being in him, or the whole Youma come from emotion thing, but as is it feels contrived. Also, I feel like Akki reabsorbing Kyoukai makes a lot of the battle pointless.") Still, the show was sweet, the pair make a cute couple, I like the style, and I the worldbuilding was pretty good. All in all, a fun show. I hope it gets a second season, though I think they ran out of source material.

I also finally started watching Index again, after pretty much exactly a year. I finished the first season of Index and Railgun, but then decided to take a break before the second season. And I just kinda didn't go back for a while. I am on episode 6 now. Still getting into the swing of things, but I like the show. I also like Index. She adds a degree of levity to a lot of the show. Though I can't help but feel it is a little odd that they are all using bladed weapons and giant flames and a bunch of super destructive magic, but no one seems to inflict lethal damage. I mean, [Index season II up to episode 5](/s "Tatemiya hits like, 20 nuns with his giant basket-hilted flamberge claymore and none of them bleed. They all bled when they decided to stab their own ears, but not when a guy with a giant fucking sword slashes them. They just fall down, apparently alive. I can't help but feel the shows fights are constrained by the show's tone.")

I re-watched Persona: Trinity Soul this past week since I couldn't recall much about it. It was more interesting than I remembered, but I would also say it was probably the kind of show my memory dumped because of how overall unsatisfying it was.

Well after watching the masterpiece that was Code Geass R1, I've stumbled across this thread, so I'd like to share some of my opinions.

The opening of this show was fairly slow I must admit. I wasn't drawn in at first. But somewhere along the way, I became super interested. Lelouch's motivations, his seemingly double nature with himself and Zero. All of the characters felt spot on. I initially disliked the animation style and art, but it didn't bother me much as the series progressed. And the finale, the last 4 episodes each played out like a finale unto themselves, kind of like Kill La Kill. Overall, this series is was insanely good and I'm kicking myself for not watching it sooner. 10/10 one of the best I've watched.

Going to start R2 Tomorrow :p

**Ping Pong the Animation** (ep7-end)  
Very good character study. Liked this a lot except the animation style which I think could have been done different but with the same effect. Cool soundtrack and engaging character. I'm not liking sport anime in gereral, but the character made it really interesting. It was a good decision to "kind of binge" this type of shows and not watch it every week. (Rating: 9/10. Close to 10)

**Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom** (ep1-6)  
Watched this because it's an Urobuchi based show (the source material) which I most of the times end up liking (but damn you Aldnoah.zero!!!). This has some flaws but is very entertaining so far and I like the setting of it. Curious in which direction this goes. I have some ideas in mind but I let it surprise me. Soundtrack is fine for now but I kind of dislike the ending theme.

After finishing Phantom I'm either going to watch: Tatami Galaxy, Shiki or Haibane Renmei.

Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse

I remember when it started airing and then we hit episode 2 and 3 and  [Did that just happen?](/s  "Almost everyone that was given a name in the first episode was mercilessly and brutally killed and the one girl that survived had to witness everyone die or their corpse being eaten and then it turns out she ain't even the MC") and I was surprised at what happened decided to stop watching the show, but I finally decided to go back through it and watch the whole thing and ended up binge watching the whole thing.  Not a great anime but pretty enjoyable for me and as a mecah fan I enjoyed the different mechs shown off but after checking the Muv-Luv wiki I realized just how much more stuff there is in the Visual Novels although I'm somewhat familiar with the basic premise of Muv-Luv Alternative (and Unlimited) due to the mangas.

**Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage** (2/12)


Black Lagoon was awesome, and so far the Second Barrage seems to be every bit as good as the first season. It's much gorier, much darker, much more violent, and much more profane, though, so it's definitely going in a new direction. I mean, you've got these two little sadistic kids who just love to hack people to bits, which is something I never expected out of the series. The only thing that's a little disappointing is the lack of the Lagoon crew, but then again, it is giving it a bit of a fresh feel. This arc's mostly focusing on the Mr. Chang, Balalaika, and the Voorhees twins. It's got the same old over the top action and constant use of "fuck", so it's still ole Black Lagoon goodness.

**Uchuu Kyoudai**: Status - **39/99**

Back when I started this show, I said that I was probably going to set it down and take a couple of breaks. Space Brothers will be the longest show I've attempted, after all, and I didn't want to run the risk of burning myself out. So even though I'm absolutely loving what I see, I'm setting it down to keep my mind fresh.

I'm still trying to figure out what I like most about Space Brothers. Is it the characters? Whether Mutta or Hibito or the wide wide range of supporting characters that drift in and out of the screen, a great slice-of-life is made or broken by its characters and Space Brothers continues to deliver. Is it the topic? I'm a space nut that watched rockets lift off, space shuttles land, watched *Endeavour* work her way through the streets of Los Angeles, is still subscribed to /r/spaceporn, and relaxes with a live feed from geosync. 

It is a show that is made to be loved. I am a watcher that was born to love it. There aren't that many times where I will encounter such synergy with an anime, and I plan on enjoying it for as long as possible.

Projected score: Pending.

**Spice And Wolf II**: Status - **COMPLETE**

I'm actually disappointed with II compared to the first season. The production values were a lot lower than I was expecting: the animation was of lower quality, the backgrounds looked washed out, the scripts seemed lazier, and the plots seemed more forced than before. It didn't carry that magic of the first season at all.

Yet there was one thing that had bothered me, and once I realized what it was I could never stop seeing it... And that was when Holo was stroking her tail. Go watch it real fast and pay attention to how her hand moves...

I don't care what animal it is, you do *not* pet a tail that way. You always go *with* the direction of the fur unless you want to seriously piss off the animal that the tail is attached to. And to watch Holo The Wise Wolf continuously do that to her own tail completely shattered my disbelief.

**The World God Only Knows** (Finished Season 1, **7/12** on Season 2)

I'd been hearing this show thrown around a lot when people were talking about "intelligent" characters, and while he's no Lelouch, I've been blown away by how entertaining this show is. I've been watching about an arc a night, and I don't think there's been an episode yet where I haven't laughed out loud at some antic on the show. I've heard really good things about the third season, so I'm excited to get there. I don't know if it's quite as good as everyone has been saying yet, but it's definitely been a fun ride so far. 

**Gintama 2/2000000something**

I started watching Gintama due to the rewatch that started up last week, unfortunately I wasn't able to get all four episodes watched in time to participate in the discussion yesterday. Can I just say, I had absolutely no idea what this show was about when I started, but I was flippin' dying of laughter even during these first two episodes. I'm excited to slowly watch this along with /r/anime for the next.... many weeks. 

**Madoka Magica: Rebellion**

Totally forgot I watched this last week as well. (Actually I watched all three movies last week, but I had already seen the series and really just wanted a refresher). This movie was glorious, I think I sat in stunned silence for a good ten minutes after finishing it. I wasn't quite sure how the movie would be, after how good the series was, but I adored it. [I mean, as much as I can adore](/s "the incredibly heartbreaking events that happened. You know what scene I mean"). It was fantastic. 10/10 all around, but I do hope that the movies stop here. I don't know if they're planning on making more, but I just don't think it can get any better at this point. 

**Death Billiards**

An incredibly short, 25 minute piece that I'd highly recommend watching. Two dudes (an old man and a young man) end up in a bar, with no idea how they got there. They are then forced to play a game of billiards where their lives are on the line. If you have any interest in psychological anime, you should check it out. It's short enough that even if you don't enjoy it, you won't really have wasted much time. Very complex story packaged into a short amount of time. 
>> ARTICLE
If I recall correctly, the anime for TWGOK does not have an actual ending so you will have to jump to the manga near the end.
>> ARTICLE
Oh dang. Well, it wouldn't be the first time I've picked up the manga to finish a show, thanks for letting me know though!
>> ARTICLE
As a big fan of TWGOK (I'm rewatching it now, while i read the manga besides it), Season 3, while IMO a brilliant story, doesn't have the same level of humor as 1 and 2. It's still a good season, but if you prefer the more humor-focused type of Anime, it's probably not the best option.

(Also, watch the Tenri arc OVA before watching Season 3. It'll help.)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the heads-up about the OVA, I don't think that's on CR so I probably would have missed it!

And nah, I love shows without much humor at all along with hilarious stuff, so as long as it has a great story I'll probably enjoy it. 
>> ARTICLE
There are two Tenri OVAs part 1 and part 2. There is also [4 Girls and an Idol](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10805/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai:_4-nin_to_Idol) that takes place between Season 2 and 3.

You're going to enjoy Gintama. It doesn't do it entirely too often but when it gets serious... it's amazing.

I wonder... Does the re-release of the original Sailor Moon episodes count as "currently airing"? I'll continue to assume it does and avoid mentioning it any further.

[**Yama no Susume**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume) and OVA : Status - **COMPLETE**  

I forget exactly which thread this was over in /r/Animesuggest, but people were talking about nice and relaxing short anime. Not the /r/anime definition of "short", which seemed to be a full 2-cour run. But actual short episodes of three-to-ten minutes or so. And in that discussion, Yama no Susume was mentioned in the same sentence as my beloved Aiura. So I simply had to watch this and make sure that it was worthy of coming near my most loved of all shorts.

And it was. Sure, some might deride it as cute-girls-doing-cute-things. But I praise it as cute-girls-walking-on-cute-mountains. Plus, as a guy who did a lot of high-adventure backpacking in the San Gorgonio Wilderness and the High Sierra as a teenager, I also happen to know that they got a lot of the little details right. 

Plus, they got a lot of character development done in those short 36 minutes. They didn't just let the girls sit around and talk about things for the entire season. Instead, the girls were actually out and about in the woods, meeting new people and experiencing different things. All in all, this was a wonderful little show that had me instantly signing up for the second season that airs this summer.

[**Nagi no Asukara**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16067/Nagi_no_Asukara): Status - **COMPLETE**

In preparation for this summer's Glasslip, I've been slowly going through every single PA Works title I can get my grubby little hands on. (What? Oh. Sorry. My hands are still dirty after taking a quick walk up to Potato Chip Rock earlier this morning. I should probably wash those before I get grit in my keyboard.) (I did mention that the mountains were calling, right?) And for some reason, I hadn't watched Nagi-asu at all while it was airing. I guess it simply slipped off my radar due to the various hype thrusters that were engaged for both the  Fall and Winter seasons. So at least I rectified my mistake, no?

And honestly? I'm glad I waited so that I could just marathon this. I would have been torturing myself on a weekly basis if I had to wait 6 days, 23 hours, and 37 minutes to find out what happened next. This was not a marathon by choice, but a marathon by obsessive necessity because the cliffhangers came fast and furious. 

Yes. Even more furious than Hikari. And that can get pretty furious indeed.

The art was amazingly beautiful, and even more so than usual for a PA Works production. The seiyuu were perfection personified. The plot was perfectly paced and the scriptwriting absolutely incredible. And, in a unique change of pace, there was finally a bizarre love polyhedron in an anime that resolved itself to my absolute satisfaction.

My only real complaint was that Crunchyroll screwed up somewhere. Apparently they have a bug in their code that made the entire screen blurry as all hell. I couldn't see anything at all sometimes, and felt lucky that I was able to pause the playback so that my screen could stabilize.

What? Nah. It couldn't be that. I never cry while watching anime! What would make you say such an awful thing to me!
(icriedlikealittlegirl) How dare you challenge my manhood like that! (seriouslyitwasafuckingsobfactory) Just who the hell do you think you are! (iamstillintearsnojoke) Hmph. See if I share any more of these things with you. (comecrywithmeletscryletscryaway)

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go down to the beach. And no, I am *not* easily influenced. What gives you that idea...

Probably not, but if you're looking for somewhere to throw a few words about it, /r/trueanime/ is having [weekly discussion threads on it](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/27gp15/a_club_for_discussion_the_subreddit_watches/).

Also Yama no Susume was great, and managed to be more funny and endearing in its short runtime than a lot of shows manage in a full run.

Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi - (10/12)

This show is actually really good. The characters are really cool and totally look the part. The heavy fantasy setting is super cool. Tons of people keep (kind of) dying, like [Spoiler Ep 10](/s "that school shooting"). I never see anything on here about this, especially considering it aired last year. 


Durarara - (15/24)

I honestly think this show is overhyped. The outcome of the first half annoyed me. Don't get me wrong: it's good, but it's not that good. I hope I'll get more into the rest of the show soon.

Toaru Majutsu no Index - rewatching (19/24)

I decided to rewatch one of the first shows I watch. I've noticed how blatantly this show is based off of a light novel series but continues to build one of the greatest settings I've seen. Touma's ability to disagree with people's lifestyles is still entertaining. For anybody who doesn't know anything about the show, I have my best synopsis: Kamijo Touma, a teenager with a special arm, takes care of cats and punches people in the face.

K-On!! (12/26)

Absolutely love this show, but I don't really have much to say about it.
>> ARTICLE
> I never see anything on here about this

Sort of because most people didn't care for it after the phenomenal initial arc. Sunday W/O God has a major case of first novel syndrome.

You don't have much to say about it because nothing happens, jk i loved that show.

I just finished* watching K-On!! for the first time 10 minutes ago and damn, that show is amazing. I love everything about it. Now I regret not getting into Slice Of Life animes before this year and waiting so much to watch K-On(It's in my list since 2010). 

I give both seasons of K-On a 10/10 - even though I finished the first season last week - and will rewatch it in the future for sure.

Watch it from the start. Although it is the same in terms of basic plot, it does a lot better than the original anime in terms of feel and pacing. But to answer your question, the stories diverge around episode 14 of Brotherhood.

Clannad

It was good, really funny at times and the characters were really good. The story felt little bit boring in itself but the characters made it better. Just started on afterstory hoping for more interesting story and more romance. Clannad gets 8/10 from me.

As I mentioned last week, I've started on my own schedule since I'm only watching one current show.

*Marathon Monday* (shows longer than ~30 episodes)  
**Gintama** (4/201) - Switched off from LoGH for the [community weekly discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/27jst8/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_14/), at least temporarily. As I wrote in that thread, I dont find it very funny so far. Sticking with it for a few more weeks though.

*Top Tuesday* (highest average rating on my to-watch list)  
**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (1/64) - Its been years since the first FMA for me but its like seeing old friends again among the military: Maes Hughes, Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, and my favorite, Alex Louis Armstrong. Nice ~~bending~~ alchemy battles for the introduction.

*Thursdub* (dubbed shows, can include rewatches of series I've seen subbed)  
**Baccano!** (2/16) - Theyve had one episode and Isaac and Miria are now one of my favorite couples in anime. I keep listening to [the opening theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UPG4w9PsgM) because its catchy, and it conveniently also helps with identifying characters. I might rewatch the first episode as I couldnt keep track of all of them the first time.

*Feels Friday* (romance/other emotional series)  
**ef: A Tale of Memories** (2/12) - Not a lot to say, other than that Im enjoying the characters now that Ive figured out whos who. Chihiros disability is just depressing. Good contrast to the other series, much slower pace that I enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on a massive FMA kick right now and am currently wrapping up Brotherhood for the third time, after watching 2003 FMA for the first time. There are small things I liked better in the original, but Brotherhood's story and characters are so amazingly well crafted and complete that it really does blow 2003 out of the water. You're in for a fantastic ride.

**Madoka Magica** (12/12) - Subbed

So, I was planning to watch the Rebellion movie and decided to go all the way from the beginning.  Last 4 episodes being a spiral downward turn to hell was awesome and I actually understood everything about the ending.  When I first watched it, I was very confused and had to look up an explanation.

My Rating: 8.5/10

**Madoka Magica Movie 1** - Subbed

It recaps the first 8 episodes of the TV series and cut out some scenes that gave some exposition of the world but it was pretty negligible.  I liked how they added in more detail in some scenes like the School's rooftop.  Nothing too memorable because I've jumped into this after the original tv series but it's important to really help set up for the next movie.  It felt like I was consistently marathoning the whole show without stopping and usually I like breaks for the ED and OP but it wasn't too bad for this.

My Rating: 8/10

**Madoka Magica Movie 2** - Subbed

This movie recaps the last 4 episodes of the TV series and if you found those episodes to be awesome then I think you'll really love this movie because in my opinion, they were able to topped themselves than in the TV series.  If you thought Episode 10 was awesome, I think you'll love how they recapped Episode 10 in this one.  However, you must watch the first movie because they moved some scenes around and it's a direct sequel to the first one so it kind of makes sense to see how they approached it.  There are some little changes and some extra added scenes which I think improves the movie then detracts it.

My Rating: 9/10

**Madoka Magica: Rebellion** - Subbed

Wait, so let me get this straight.  [Movie Spoilers](/s "First, Homura creates an ideal world for the original Magical Girls.  Then, she realizes this ideal world is fake then explores it.  Afterwards, she finds out that she became a witch creating this world; it's awesome how I was able to find that out right before she announces it.  Boom, plot twist, the incubators trapped her Soul gem in a barrier to observe this Law of Cycles which is actually Madokami.  Everyone then decides to break the maze and all of the incubators basically die by Madokami, they all scream how they all don't get why they're all getting killed.  Homura then was able to come back to normal and Madokami is trying to take Homura with her.  Homura turns into a devil because she loves Madoka too much and wants to protect her, she then grabs her and takes away part of her power to create a gigantic labyrinth that encapsulates the current universe they're in.  By doing so, everyone goes back to their daily lives like usual except for Homura who now plays the role of villain in I guess what is implied as the next movie.")   

I could see how many people found the movie to be troubling.  When I was watching it, it was 2 in the morning and I couldn't really form an opinion nor react... I just sat there and watched what was unfolding in that ending.  It was visually spectacular and so entertaining overall.  They really underutilized [minor spoilers](/s "the new magical girl which was Nagisa or somewhere along that line.  I guess her role will be more important in the possible sequel movie.")  This movie really needs a rewatch for me to form an opinion on that ending, I'll just say that I'm okay with the movie's ending.

My Rating: 9.5/10

**Akira** (2001 English Dub)

I'll say that it was really mature film.  I could definitely see how this movie was regarded as a classic, the action scenes were top notch and I really loved the dystopia world they've built.  Some people complained about the characters but I found them to be fine, maybe there wasn't much depth but I guess the most important thing was the plot.  Some said that Manga is better and helps you understand the film adaption, I'll pick it up another time.  

**Kiniro Mosiac** (3/12) - Subbed

It's cute girls doing cute things.  Such an understatement for everything so far, I think the show handled the Engrish the most out of all other anime I've seen so far.  I love all of the characters, I can't find any characters I dislike.  If I was a Harem MC and had to choose my harem, I would choose Kiniro Mosiac's girls.  So much cuteness that I must not marathon it otherwise I'll get diabetes or just be too sad that I've rushed it.

**Welcome to the NHK** (3/24) - English Dub

On my first watch, I was depressed and picked it up.  I've learned some cool lessons and experienced an amazing story.  Now, on my second watch.  I kind of want to change my life style, time to get a job, time to get out of the house!

All the voices are pretty spot on as well as well acted and considering it's dubbed by Funimation then I don't think I'll be disappointed.  I was also able to relax and not have to read the subtitles, all I have to do is just listen and being able to hear the soundtrack was a nice change.  The soundtrack is relaxing and somber so far.  Hearing the voices in English really make me empathize with Satou much more early on than in the sub. So far, it's awesome.  

If asked Subbed or Dubbed, so far I would say you should just go with what's comfortable with you but if you understand English orally then go with the Dubbed because hearing a language you understand instead of reading it is what I think much more immersive.

Just finished watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica.


While it was good, I think I waited too long to watch it. The reason being that on this sub you always see someone watching it and they're like "Oh it's not so crazy or anything" and everyone starts commenting "oh just wait" and all that. I think that hyped it up a bit too much for me because nothing really surprised me in the show. Everything seemed pretty laid out and clear. There were some elements that I found unexpected and interesting, but nothing big ever really wowed me or made me think, "Whoa that was insane". I'd still recommended watching it to anyone who hasn't. 

8/10
>> ARTICLE
So I decided to watch **Kill La Kill** just because the "hype" was killing me...wow, what a freaking let down. This anime has nothing appealing to me unfortunately.


Character designs and art was great. Sound track was well fitting but everything else was weak imho :/

6/10 - Will never watch again
>> ARTICLE
Personally I loved it, but I can totally see where you are coming from. The story itself is pretty average. It derps around a lot and it doesn't know what it wants to be half the time. Some of the characters are enjoyable, others not so much. There were a bunch of dead ends in character development or ideas that didn't go anywhere.

What really sold me on Kill La Kill was the style. I hate that I can't come up with a more descriptive word than "style", but there was a sense in which the experience of watching the show refreshingly different. It almost felt like the art, animation and music style was designed specifically for the story instead of it being crafted from a multi-purpose template. I would compare the feeling to watching a Quentin Tarantino film. It just has a *distinct feeling* distinct from the other stuff that I've seen before. I can't speak as to whether Kill La Kill actually did anyhing at all remarkable with it's presentation, but I can definitely say that it felt like it.      
>> ARTICLE
And I completely agree with your point about style. No matter how meh I found it overall, the art, the design, the action scenes and soundtrack was well put together. But again, to each their own :D


My one friend loved it, another is just grateful for all the superb cosplayers. 
>> ARTICLE
I also just watched Kill la Kill and I really enjoyed it.

Mako was my favorite character too.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, I felt the same way when I watched it while it was airing. It does get better though although not that much. It's a pretty divisive anime it seems, I gave it a 7/10 myself to give you an idea. I'd say 6/10 is the lowest bar for me to enjoy something but never remember or recommend it. Was the plot and characters get going it becomes a lot better but it takes awhile for that to happen and even then the antagonist is just meh. 
>> ARTICLE
"Will never watch again" seems kind of harsh for a 6/10
>> ARTICLE
Well, 6 out of 10 is a fair rating I believe. There are no lovable moments, there are no memorable moments so "will never watch again" does justice for me. For example, if given the chance to watch **KLK** or any random Anime, I'd pick the latter.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, there are some 9/10s in my own list that are under the category of "will never watch again". From titles like the original Uchuu Senkan Yamato or Boys Be.... Or titles that I can't rewatch due to spoilering myself like Kokoro Connect or Myself;Yourself or... Well. You get the idea. 

On the same track, I'll be watching a few of my 7/10s again. The shorts like Aiura or Yama no Susume. Fun brain-off series like Working!! or Nichibros. And even a possible rewatch of 6/10 rated Tiger & Bunny so that I can enjoy the dub and possibly upgrade the score.

Just because it's in the "will never watch again" doesn't mean that it's a harsh opinion. Hells. I have KlK under "will not watch again" status, and I damn well loved it. I just have too much anime to watch and not as many decades to fit it all into.
>> ARTICLE
Myself;yourself huh? I'm pretty sure I've watched this a long while ago but I can't help but remember anything about the plot or characters or much of anything.

Ye gods, but I only wish I could forget Myself;Yourself. I saw it in 2010 and I still have certain scenes burned into my retina.

Heh. Yeah, Aoi's voice is always an easy one to remember. Then again, that voice is kinda Kanade Tomoko's stock in trade. Once you hear her once, you never ever forget her. 

So. A summary. Kid moves away from childhood home and goes to Tokyo. Five years later, he comes back and wonders why his best friend has changed so much. [Summary Spoilers](/s "The show also features the killing of small animals, light twincest, and images of suicide attempts.")

Kill La Kill might of been one of those shows where you had to watch it as it was airing and enjoy the discussion about it. That, or you just have to not critique it and enjoy it for the crazy, ridiculous ride that it is.

Also is it me or is 6/10 a bit high for an anime series you will never watch again?
>> ARTICLE
I contest that theory.  I never watched any of it till after it had just finished, and hadn't been reading any of the hype either (though I was aware it existed).  Loved the hell out of it.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it's between a 5 and 6. Overall it wasn't impressive or even enjoyable to me. I normally tend to rate anime that I watch starting at 4, which I'd call "bad" or "horrible." Kill La Kill is a 5/6 because it had some things that I enjoyed. Mako for example, breaking the tension with her randomness. Art was well done and OST which I mentioned above. KLK is the lowest rating I've given any anime, that's why I said I'd never watch it again.

Ahh that is fair enough! I usually just rate shows that I've watched on how enjoyable they were, so it is interesting to see how other people rate things.

After every season, I re-watch shows marathon style.

So, from last season:

Nisekoi (I noticed how in the first episode they totally ignore the usual "MC seat" in the classroom. They just leave a single classroom desk on the last row by the window almost on purpose. Just thought I'd point that out.)

Others:

Noucome (for the lulz)

Free! (readying my body for S2)

and finally Shingeki no Kyoujin (because I magically found a copy of the Blu-Ray somewhere. Where? I forgot.)

**Eve no Jikan** (6/6) - Comfy. I've no more words to say. Great anime 9/10

**H2** (41/41) - It's by Adachi (Touch, Cross Game), often considered a master of every day life, but with this work he picks up an baseball history with romance in the back ground (different from both I mentioned earlier where is the other way around), the anime ended too soon and in a uneventful moment, so it receives a 6/10, but the manga takes everything further beyond and finishes, in my opinion, Adachi best ever made manga (for the manga 9/10).
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka, Spice and Wolf, and Haganai. Hyouka is a rewatch (which I shouldn't be doing considering my 180+ title backlog), but so far I am enjoying the other two. I can't believe it has taken me this long to watch Spice and Wolf. So glad I finally am, though.


I also finished Madoka Magica just yesterday. Best decision ever.

**Kara no Kyoukai, Films 5-7:** This is now one of my top 10 series of all time. I love the type-moon universe.

*Movie #5:* Wow, this was one hell of a movie. The characters, the symbolism, the themes, everything about this movie was easily the pinnable of this amazing series. Score: 9.5/10

*Movie #6:* Lackluster being stuck in between movies 5 and 7, and I think the weakest of the series. Score: 6.25/10

*Movie #7:* A great way to end this series. Not much to say but sad it's over. Score: 8.5/10

>> ARTICLE
Should I watch Kara no Kyoukai? I was recommended to watch it by my friends after they told me to watch Fate/Zero and read Fate/Stay Night since they're in an alternate universe. I tried getting through the first few minutes of the first movie but was turned off by the blood.

Is it good enough to stick through the gore? (I'm a bit of a wimp)
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, the entire series gives off dark tones most of the time, accompanied by a lot of blood and death. Even I was squeamish at a lot of the scenes.

I'd say save this series for later if you can't handle it. Maybe try to watch other anime with less dark, gory tones like Fate/Zero to get more accustomed to it.

**Symphogear** (5/13)

Continuing my enjoyment of mecha series with female leads from last week, I went on to Symphogear. Well, it's more of a mahou shoujou show than a mecha show, but it does have mecha elements in it. In that sense, it reminds me of the Nanoha series. Enjoying it so far. 

**Wolf Children**

Watched the movie last night. From what I've been reading I came into the movie expecting onions, but strangely I came out fine (before people start calling me heartless, Air, Anohana and Clannad were definitely tear inducing for me). I enjoyed the movie though, for me it had the theme and feel of a Ghibi movie, which is never a bad thing. 
>> ARTICLE
While all 3 of those made me feel feels, I didn't really cry much. Characters ( and people in reality) dying doesn't really phase me, I just kind of shrug it off. 


>> ARTICLE
Wolf Children is not a sad film at all, it will leave you feeling good about yourself (at least that is the way I see it). I'm going to be honest, I cried a little bit but out of happiness. Stuff like AnoHana and Clannad made me feel sad, but didn't really make me cry. The only stuff that makes me cry is when good things happen that make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno about feeling good about yourself. I, too, watched it last night and all I can really say is that [spoilers]( /s " aside form Yuki's bright future, I felt that Ame was a massive dick not to even *hug* his mum at the end like that :( ")

**Akira (Movie)**

My friend recommended that I watch this. He said it's one of his favorite anime movies of all time. I just finished it and I have to say, what the fuck did I just watch? I noticed that this was referenced in the South Park episode "Trapper Keeper" right away when the scene popped up. I enjoyed this but I have no idea what was happening for about half of it and the ending was crazy. I'm not 100% sure I fully understand still even after reading analysis online to see exactly what happened. It was great, but a little too confusing for me, mainly because I'm simple-minded :3 **9/10**

**Monster (14/74)** (Watched 1-14)

Same friend that recommended Akira recommended this as well (In return, I recommended he watch Madoka Magica, which he said he tried once and hated it but he only watched ep 1). This is really interesting. I wasn't expecting a hospital type show when watching this. I wasn't really sure what to expect, I guess. But yeah. I really liked this so far. My only downside is that it's a little slow, but it seems perfect with the story.

**Fight Ippatsu! Juden-Chan!! (3/12)** (Watched 1-3)

When I said last week I was going to seriously start killing my backlog, I didn't expect it to go this way. Well, watch this if you like Ecchi, or have a pissing fetish. It's weird. I'm probably gonna stick it out because the weird stuff isn't that prominent, and I hate adding "dropped" shows to my anime list.

>> ARTICLE
Monster is a masterpiece. 

"And slowly... you come to realize.. it's all as it should be..."


>> ARTICLE
It's not really your fault when it comes to Akira, it was a rushed adaptation of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
If you want to better understand Akira I would strongly recommend reading the manga. A lot had to be cut and the movie was made before the manga was finished.

Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into it.

**Steins;Gate 10/10**

Great Anime, amazing history, great characters. The only thing i dind't like very much was the art.

**Shinsekai yori ~~9/10~~ **

I just finish it, it's  great. ~~I just didn't give it 10/10 because i didn't like the ending very much~~ thinking better a couple of hours after a finish it the ending was great.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! 7/10**

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren 5/10**

That's the anime that didn't need this second Season, the frist one was ok but i got really pissed with the second one ending , [SPOILER](/s "two seasons and not even a kiss that was ridiculous"). If you want to watch it stop at season one it's a good ending. For me season two never existed.

**Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. 8/10**

This anime is a great comedy it really made me laught out loud, i recommend it for anyone who likes slice of life.

EDIT: words 





>> ARTICLE
If you liked Steins;Gate that much and didn't like the art, I highly recommend checking out the visual novel sometime, though maybe not right away since you just finished the anime.

[**Birdy the Mighty: Decode**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3974/Tetsuwan_Birdy_Decode)

Really fun sci-fi action/adventure that pops up occasionally in lists of "underrated" shows. I started watching it pretty much at random, and ended up marathoning both seasons in two days. Based on the premise, I was expecting something really cheesy and mediocre, and was very pleasantly surprised.

The first season meanders a bit and has some pacing issues, but it's still pretty good; the story gets a lot better in the second season. It starts out as light entertainment and progressively dials up the pathos as it goes.  Even though there's no single aspect that's perfect, it's the kind of show that's just so likable that I don't *want* to criticize it too much.

The one thing that I found most striking is the way it handles its fights. There are plenty of the usual flashy, relatively bloodless fight scenes... and then there are occasional moments where it uses violence for a real dramatic impact, without either reveling in it or flinching away from it. It's also interesting that the impetus for the plot of season 2 isn't the big, flashy climactic battle of season 1, in and of itself, but [spoiler](/s "the massive collateral damage it caused for innocent bystanders.")

Finally, a catchy [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-01piZuA6o) and [ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMrMtC6Q2MY) are always a plus, even if the ending occasionally induces severe mood whiplash.

Saraiya Goyou (House of Five Leaves). Enjoyable anime. Loved the setting, the characters were good and I loved how everyone was linked in some way from the past. Just wish a little more happened, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. 7/10.

I'm rewatching Haganai NEXT because the dub was recently released. It's been excellent. There's something special about this show that makes it one of my favorites.

>> ARTICLE
I haven't been watching much lately, but I decided to start **Psycho-Pass** this week (7/22). After so much hype I guess I'm actually kinda let down. The series is well designed (all but the main character, SHE LOOKS SO OUT OF PLACE AND WEIRD) and well animated. It just seems to focus on all of these side-characters that I could care less about.

When you have an interesting cast (the Enforcers mainly) it's unfortunate we have to perspective shift to [Psycho-Pass Spoilers](/s "Murderous Schoolgirls") it's just... disappointing to say the least.

However despite all that I definitely plan on finishing it out. It looks too good, has a fleshed out world, and sounds too damn good not to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, it all has a purpose. Stoked for s2.
>> ARTICLE
She's supposed to look out of place. She is. She's new to something that's way crazier than she imagined and right at the start of an even crazier criminal.

>> ARTICLE
That's not really what I meant. I just meant that her character design looks radically different compared to everyone else in the series. The whole face is just weird.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, that was definitely true for me too. However, around where you're at now you'll start to notice it less. Also the show gets better from here on out. It ended up being a really nice surprise for me since I hadn't watched an anime in awhile before picking that up.

>> ARTICLE
Finished ep 11 of SAO. My enthusiasm has steadily dwindled. After the new ep I doubt I'm going to continue.

Episode 11 is where I dropped it too.

**Akagi**

I watched three episodes and it seems interesting but my experience is hurt a lot by the fact that I know absolutely nothing about Mahjong. 

**Kaiji**

Much more my speed. I've watched thirteen episodes so far and I'm loving it. The character design didn't bother me as much as I thought it would and it does a really good job with the atmosphere of tension and betrayal. It's also one of the few anime where I find the main character genuinely intelligent. Instead of the "how the hell did he do that?" that I usually get, I'm constantly thinking "wow that's pretty smart." At least in the boat arc that is. There doesn't seem to be as much strategy in this new one but I just started it so we'll see where it goes. 

**One Piece**

After 200 episodes two years ago, I've decided to tackle this beast once more. I started at the beginning of Water Seven/Enies Lobby (awesome) and I'm currently in the middle of Thriller Bark. I don't like this one as much but it has its moments. I do like the addition of Brook and Franky though. I didn't realize they joined so close together.

Just finished Hataraku Maou-sama! and am currently watching Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.

I've recently gotten some of my friends into some of my favorite animes. This past month we've watched episodes of Death Note, FMA, Kill La Kill, Trigun, and Elfen Lied among others. Pretty sick.

I watched [Planetes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/329/Planetes) early this week.

I hated both of the main characters immensely at some point. Tanabe was so god-awfully annoying with such irritating self-righteous ideals at the early part of the show. However, eventually I just pitied her. At the very least, I liked how she [late show spoilers](/s "stayed true to her ideals and overcame her selfish desires.") On the other hand, I thought Hachirota was a fuckwit from beginning to end. In the beginning, he was obnoxious as all hell but still endearing in a way. As the story progressed however, I only hated him more as I did not sympathize with his ideals at any point, nor did I accept his train of thought.
The other characters, however, were great.

The story developed quite nicely though, considering how terrible i thought the main characters to be. I still loved the rest of the cast, and the themes and realism were quite entertaining to watch. 

(7/10)

Outbreak Company, really enjoyed the plot as well as all the references in the show ^-^

I finally watched[last four episodes of Seitokai Yakuindomo *] (/s "and they were as funny as the rest.")
>> ARTICLE
Sort of new to watching anime, so I've been going off some recommendations from friends.

**Code Geass** - **Finished the first season**

That cliffhanger ending to the first season. WOW. Great characters, extremely interesting plot, and solid plot twists. Really enjoyable to watch. A few tear jerkers [spoiler](/s "like when Lelouch erases Shirley's memory of him"). The show put me on the edge of my seat numerous times. Planning to watch the second season soon. 9/10 

**Black Lagoon** - **Finished the second season**

This show was raw and I loved it. Rock and Revy were stellar characters. I loved their dynamic. Lots of action. The plot wasn't anything too crazy though. I really appreciated that there's a lot of cursing, considering the characters were all outlaws doing seedy jobs in a seedy town. It really fit the show. My main gripe was with the ending - the season just sort of ended. Sadly there's no season three. 7.5/10

**Welcome to the NHK** - **Completed**

I was recommended to watch this since I liked Steins;Gate. Started off interesting and I liked the Steins;Gate-esque humor but the show really tanked for me when [spoiler](/s "Sato went to the suicide island"). After that the show just stayed meh, and the ending was pretty unsatisfying. Loved the music though. 6/10

I'm always looking for recommendations if anyone has any. Specifically I'm looking for a currently airing or upcoming show to watch.

I just finished Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and Sword Art online this week. Man FMA:B was amazing. SAO was good too, but the second half was terrible.

**Kaiba Episodes 1-3:**

[My writeup for the r/trueanime Anime Club](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2715fq/anime_club_in_futurum_kaiba_14/chwicxi).

I don't plan to drop it. Episodes 1-2 left me completely cold. Yes, I can get the themes, and yes, the presentation sure is "interesting", but I don't care for the world, and I don't care for the characters, and the story felt a bit dull to me as well. If anything, it reminded me of the Rotoscoped version of A Scanner Darkly, a movie I was bored enough watching that I stopped the DVD I rented after 50 minutes and called it quits.

The gulf between the rich and the poor, the connotations of having sex with yourself, using and being used, and questioning the nature of "self", when one has no memories, and then loses their body - who is "them", at that point? I can see them all, but that ideas are interesting doesn't make their presentation so - that means it's interesting for *me* to *think about them*.

Episode 3 dealt a bit with themes, but it was much better because it was focused on a small and personal story, of love and loss, of tragedy in the world. The death of dreams. It was a story about unconditional love, betrayal, and *regret*.

I'm curious where it'd go from here, but I'm not fully committed just yet.

**Claymore episodes 5-10:**

You may have heard me say it before, but I like revisiting older material, rewatching favourite scenes or rereading favourite sequences in books.

Last night I was too tired and not in mood to consume new anime, and people discussed Claymore, so I fired up thos episodes to which I sometimes return again. [spoilers](/s "Clare's meeting with Theresa, and meeting with the Awakened Being, where Clare gets to be awesome.")

I just really like the bit about [spoilers](/s "Clare and Theresa"), of how they meet, how they transform, and the end it comes to. Somehow shows often do "flashbacks", not to older material from the show, but to material happening earlier, time-wise, better than they do everything else. Claymore is no exception.

**Paranoia Agent Episodes 1-3:**

Watched the with /u/AnimeClub, [you can see my write-up here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/27ke0d/anime_club_watch_19_paranoia_agent_13_spoilers/ci1mwqx), very happy I managed to only take notes post-episode, rather than take my usual full-length notes, for once!

First thing first, the bobblehead OP, the manic energies, the "world music" vibe. It's been so long since I've last watched it, and it's very nostalgic, and I quite like it.

It's very much a Satoshi Kon production, where the lines are blurred not only between the real and the imagined, but the real and the unreal. Reality is constantly negotiated, not just by each individual, but the community. There's the theme of "urban legends", so the art-style that reminds me of Dennou Coil is even more relevant. The storyline of characters looking for an easy way out, and perhaps their desires manifesting outwardly in a way that can harm them reminds me of a convention game of Unknown Armies I've played around 2000-2001.

A plethora of characters, a mystery, a *conspiracy*. A show about the distance between people, about the weight crushing down on them in modern life, where we're all packed together, yet there's no real intimacy, no real trust.
>> ARTICLE
This week I continued catching up on **Sword Art Online**, and am now well into the second arc (17/26). I've already run into a few good reasons people consider this the weaker half, but I'm not gonna let it get me down! If you like episodic writeups, [my post for episode 15 was particularly ranty](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/06/06/sword-art-online-episode-15/), as the show introduced its crazy-as-balls second villain.
>> ARTICLE
**Sword Art Online** It's a lovely love story. The second arc was meh and the first arc could have been longer, but it does make want to read the novels.

**Stein's;Gate**  Hit me harder than train.  So good, such feels. It was an amazing plot; even better character development and relationship development.  For a time travel story, it was remarkable unconfusingly told.  People complain a lot about the first couple episodes; I actually liked the first few episodes, they were actually some of my favorite intro episodes.  The first few episodes set up a lot of how is this important and what exactly is happening?  I admit the catalyst takes a little long to realize, but it is a complex story to initiate. ***Top 3***

**Time of Eve** I would describe it as a cult classic.  It is short and it really makes you think about ethics and morality and what it means to be human.

**Date A Live** I watched this a light-hearted break from the two above.  I always watch a cheesy romantic type is awesome reseting my feels.

**Say I Love You 50%** In the mood for some feels and it was recommended by a friend.
>> ARTICLE
Early Steins;Gate can be hard to get into because it's a lot slower paced and the first episode has a number of (at the time) unexplained elements.

But you're absolutely right; not a single part of them was a mistake. They were incredibly important in setting up the rest of the story, both in narrative and in emotional investment

Finished Chihayafuru 2 yesterday. I watched Chihayafuru 1 couple of months ago and really enjoyed and decided to watch the second one. I really enjoyed both but felt bummed out that there wasn't a third series. Going to read the manga to continue the story and see what happens.
>> ARTICLE
Watching Mushishi. Hadn't heard about it before the new season started airing, sounded interesting but I only just got around to watching it. Really good so far, reminds me a lot of the Hellblazer comics, except Ginko isn't quite as prone to getting everyone around him killed as John Constantine is. 
>> ARTICLE
Re-watched **GunXSword**. One of the few mecha shows I've watched, as I was intrigued how they had "Original Seven" line of robots, which is aesthetically cool IMHO. I also liked how a revenge story is played well right through the end. 

8/10 - Would watch again (which I already did)

A friend recommended watching **Another**, which isn't my cup of tea. After watching the first 3 episodes though, I was instantly hooked. I ended up marathoning the whole series (12 eps) in one night, and it was a shocking and suspense-filled experience. 

9/10 

>> ARTICLE
Just finished up **Joshiraku**, the first episode's first line of dialogue being *"You should read manga as it is. Why would anybody want to make an anime adaptation?"* you pretty much know your in for a series packed with meta-jokes and it does not disappoint. 

9-10/10 would watch again. (also, the [ED](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xtbjkj_joshiraku-ed-full-nippon-egao-hyakkei-%E3%81%98%E3%82%87%E3%81%97%E3%82%89%E3%81%8F%E7%B5%90%E3%81%B3%E3%83%8B%E3%83%83%E3%83%9D%E3%83%B3%E7%AC%91%E9%A1%94%E7%99%BE%E6%99%AF_shortfilms) is great.)

Kill la Kill - Complete


I went into Kill la Kill expecting to be a bit disappointed. After seeing all the hype for it, I didn't think it'd live up to be quite as good as everyone said. Turns out, it's every bit as good as everyone said. I loved the art style, the action was great, it was funny, it was unique, it was fucking batshit insane, and was all around one of the best anime experiences I've ever had. I loved every minute of it. And on a related note, one of my friends also watched and finished it because of me, and we've been shouting "[Nudisto.... BEEEACH!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8WZ8DDejd4)" nonstop like a couple of fucking lunatics, so it's also responsible for that.


Yu Yu Hakusho - 1/112


I've been a big fan of Yu Yu Hakusho since middle school, and I've read the books at least five times. Just this week I realized that I somehow never watched the anime adaptation. I already know I'm gonna like it being a fan of the manga, and since I'm only one episode in so far, I do have a few first impressions. I'm watching the dub, I do like the voices (but why does Kuwabara sound like Muscle Man from Regular Show?). The animation is pretty nice too, even for a show from the 90s. The music's dated as fuck, but that's my only complaint. Overall, it seems like it's going to be a kickass watch, even though it's the second longest anime I've tried to watch so far, the first being Yu-Gi-Oh at 240-something episode. Not looking forward to getting a bowl of onions in the room again at the two mini arcs with Jiro the dog and the old man with the tanuki, though.
>> ARTICLE
You are in for an amazing ride when it comes to YYH. It is my favorite show of all time and i try to re-watch it 2 or 3 times a year. The dub is amazing, and as far as i can tell is one of the few where the dub is quite highly regarded, Kuwabara's voice is silly, but in a charming way that doesn't pull you out of the story from listening to it. As for the onions comment, i have never actually read the books, but i have heard a few of the filler arcs were cut, and i have 0 recollection of any dog or tanuki in the show, so no need to worry about that.

Yeah, F/Z is a prequel and not really meant to stand on its own. The ending was completely fine (though admittingly rushed) if you read the Fate/Stay Night visual novel first.

AHH! That makes sense. Waver Velvet is amazing though.

**Cowboy Bebop 26/26:**

Really disliked the episodic nature of the show, but WOW did the ending make up for it. The ending so perfectly ties together everything random that happens in episodes 1-23 that I didn't like. The final scene where Spike goes makes the finger gun and goes "bang.." ... that was haunting. **10/10**

**Bakemonogatari 2/15:**

I was never really interested in the show, but I made it my duty to watch all the most popular shows of this era (still have FMA:B and Steins;Gate to watch) I don't really know what I'm supposed to think of this. Maybe its just the fact that I don't understand the nuances and intricacies of the Japanese language, but it seems pretty average to me - however, the little I did understand (through Google) was pretty interesting. The visuals really are great though - Shaft did this show right. Oh and Senjougahara is hot. **7/10**

Give Bake a few more episodes. It really started odd for me too, but I got hooked after a few episodes and an episode near the end made me love it. And I agree that Senjougahara is best girl

Kill la Kill 24/24 (All 24 this week) I started watching this while it was airing. The first three episodes didn't do much to impress me so I dropped it. After resolving to stick with it for at least 6 episodes, I'm happy I did. Very good and fun anime.

Psycho-Pass 10/22 (2 episodes this week) I took a bit of a break from this series when I got busy with finals. It seems to be picking up much more now, and I'm excited to see where the series is headed.

Last week I watched Psycho Pass. This week I watched Fate/Zero. I did enjoy it, but not as much as Psycho Pass. 

The pacing was really strange in my opinion especially with how long Caster's little arc lasted, but I thought the characters were a bit stronger and I certainly felt more towards them than I did the characters in PP especially that ending scene with Waver and Rider. 

Overall, I thought it was excellent and I plan to finish the Urobuchi Trifecta with Madoka Magica and if it's as good as everyone says it is, I will have no problem with considering Gen Urobuchi as my favorite anime writer.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm also 2/3 for the "Urobuchi Trifecta", have watched Fate/Zero (loved so much I watched it 3 times) and Madoka Magica (very strange yet also very good, was confused as heck out of Rebellion tho), but haven't seen Psycho Pass yet. How is it (no spoilers)?

**House of Five Leaves (08 / 12 episodes)** and I'm loving it so far. Fantastic characters and a story that is slowly paced and involves near-to-zero action but still has me interested like few others have been able to in the last months. It has a certain charm to it that most likely originates from the combination of the insanely well performance of the voice actors and the unique character design that really focuses on expression rather than looking 100% perfect all the time.

**Seitokai Yakuindomo*** (13/13)

I finally finished the the second season and the first 8 OVAs and they were certainly a lot of fun, I'm hoping that there will be a third season since I really want there to be more.

**Hanasaku Iroha** (26/26)

People have been hyping PA works really hard with Glasslip this summer so I decided to check out some of their other work to see why there was so much hype.  I knew pretty much nothing about this show and I was absolutely blown away by it and I'm honestly not even sure why.  The art was absolutely fantastic and the characters were really captivating, it was one of the best shows I've seen.

**Nagi no Asukara** (11/26)

After completing Hanasaku Iroha and absolutely loving it, I decided the next thing to check out was AsuNagi since people also recommended it.  And so far its been really great, possibly even better than Hanasaku Iroha.  The concept is very unique and the art is some of the best I've seen, I especially like overall feel of setting with all of the different blues.

On the whole I've watched quite a lot of good anime this week and I'm fully on board the hype train for Glasslip, I would never have guessed the anime that I'm most excited about, to be about a high schooler who wants to be a glass blower.

I got my wisdom teeth out on Friday, and I've spent the last two days watching Nodame Cantabile for the second time. Honestly, I can't think of a better show to watch when you're recovering and in pain. It's light and silly, but also soothing thanks to all of the wonderful classical music renditions. I watched it dubbed in English on Crackle and found myself more impressed with the dub than I thought I'd be. Certainly Nodame's distinctive Gyabo's and Mukya's can't be recreated in English, but the voice actress give the character a real sense of warmth to a degree greater than the original performance. The dub on the whole is pretty great, there's a lot of actors in it who have very distinctive and interesting voices while also sounding like real people. Nodame Cantabile entered my favorites by the time I was done with the third season, but going back and watching the first season again it's just as great, and it's only risen in my esteem on rewatch. 9/10.

I've been watching [Bokurano](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1690/Bokurano), which I 'm really enjoying. I saw a GRArkada review on it and it reminded me I had it in my PTW list for a long time and after hearing his initial thoughts and rating of it I checked it out. The initial premise is a little hard to swallow but the aftermath of it has been really interesting so far. It kinda comes off as the whole mecha element to be just a plot device to dive into character stories all of which so far have been entertaining so I don't mind. I have a long way to go though, only on episode 10/24. Definitely recommend it to those who like dark character focused anime, the mechs are my least favorite part but they're ok, the show does do a good job of making you feel the scale of these behemoths as they dwarf every man made object surrounding them but the cgi and animation in general can be  a bit distracting.

I've also been watching [Bakuman](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7674/Bakuman./characters), still really enjoying it. Only thing I don't like is how cartoony the antagonist Eiji is. Everyone else feels so down to earth and real and then this goofy ass mangaka god is shown just sitting in his chair acting like a 5 year old pumping out manga nonstop. Looking forward to seeing how this show develops since it has like 3 seasons.

Bakuman definitely does get better as you get further into the seasons (not exactly a big surprise there). Look forward to it! :p

**Kill La Kill**

I tried watching this series once before after it had been airing for a little while and only managed to watch the first two episodes before becoming insanely bored. I gave it another try this weekend and once I got to the [SP](/s "King of the Hill fights with the Elite Four") it picked up in a massive way and became way more entertaining.

I was just insanely bored for the first several episodes but ended up marathoning it once I got far enough. Some absolutely great episodes towards the end constantly keeping the audience on their toes as to what's going to happen next. Awesome Soundtrack to boot.

[Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6114/Rainbow:_Nisha_Rokubou_no_Shichinin) - Really strong series with a nice emphasis on the bonds between the characters. Would've preferred it to be a bit darker in the later half of the series but still amazing nonetheless!

[Amagami SS+ Plus](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11235/Amagami_SS+_Plus) - My experience with Amagami as a whole was positive but there were routes I preferred over others i.e. Kaoru > Rihoko > Nanasaki > The rest. So it was nice seeing the continuation of the story lines I liked. [Rihoko's route](/s "where she finally gets together with Junichi was amazing and finally gives her some closure which I was super happy for!")

[Senyuu.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15751/Senyuu.) - Oh, my, god. This short series was insane!! Laugh out loud funny from start to finish, looking forward to watching season 2 tonight!

I actually cheered at the end of Rihoko's arc in SS+, as she was my choice for Best Girl in the first anime. So watching her arc was a vast relief for me. Well, that and it came immediately after Tsukasa. Anything is an improvement over Tsukasa. She was the only girl in Amagami that I passionately hated and would gladly have her run over with a nice boat if it would just shut her lying, deceitful, manipulative mouth.

Oh my god YES, Tsukasa's route was so annoying over the period of the two seasons! The + series especially because the damn election bought all of her worst points to the forefront, definitely worst girl imo

**Toradora!** (20/25 episodes seen)

Oh my fuck. I usually don't addictively marathon slice of life anime but so far this show has done everything right. The characters are all amazing and hilarious with a surprising amount of depth. Even the one note side characters like the homeroom teacher or the pet parrot have me laughing like a maniac. In addition, the show manages to be relentlessly interesting and often I don't even know what I want to happen next. The arcs feel like they are actually doing something instead of just being filler, and the character development is believable and engaging. 

Out of all the shows that I have been trying to catch up on recently, this one has been the biggest surprise hit. Hopefully it finishes just as strongly as it began. I'm definitely feeling a solid 9/10 at this point.

I was so disappointed with Captain Earth that I went to Studio Bones older mecha work. It's definitely has some Evangelion vibes but it's not a ripoff as some people claim. I'm about 2/3 of the way through and I'm really digging it so far.

I just started this! I'm on Episode 10. 

Here's how I explained it to my friend:
You know how NGE is a philosophical thriller hiding behind mech and religious imagery and aliens? This show is a non-ironic mech and religious imagery and aliens show. The fact that NGE wore it as a misdirection/facade doesn't mean it's wrong for someone else to wear it as their true face.

**Akuma no Riddle** - 4 episodes in

Its a fairly interesting battle royale style action drama with some yuri undertones. Not gonna win any awards but it is a solid show so far.

**Welcome to the NHK** - 4 episodes in

I think its a pretty unique show, but kinda slow at times. I'm interested in how Sato ends up so I'll most likely stick with it to the end.

**Mirai Nikki** - Dropped after 5 episodes

It had an interesting concept, but I just didn't like how it skipped around so much. The only character that really interested me was Ninth, but I felt Yuno and Yuki were pretty shallow MCs.

**Baka and Test S1** - Completed

A really funny slapstick show. Didn't have much plot to it, but it more than made up for it with the comedy.

**Another**- Completed

Started off very strong, but lost its atmosphere [spoiler] (/s "at the beach scene"). I stuck around to the end though, and it tied up all loose ends very nicely.

___________________________

**Kiddy Grade (2002)** [9/24]

[[MAL]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/274/Kiddy_Grade?) [[Wikipedia]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiddy_Grade)

Animated by Gonzo Digimation and gmik, *Kiddy Grade* is a series based on the premise that humanity has expanded past our solar system and new worlds are colonised with futuristic technology. The protagonists clair and Lumire are two girls that are special operations members of the GOTT, a group similar to the UN (but in space).

I was recommended this series by a friend after a conversation about television back in the 2000s turned to anime that we unwittingly watched as kids. My first impression is that for a series that was made in 2002, the animation is really good. Well of course I'm only on the first episode but the standard was superior to other shows at the time, like *Gundam SEED*. 

The protagonists are quite likeable and the first episode set up the feel of normality, how all of these sci-fi concepts are common-day occurences and is very immersive when it comes to the lore of the *Kiddy Grade* universe. No plot has been developed so far, but it's only the first episode so I'll give it a break for now.

As for music, the [opening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnmbrSfefi8) is catchy and the [ending](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcRqxSA77aU) is quite relaxing. The non-diegetic music during the episode itself is sometimes out of place and doesn't fit the mood, but that is just personal preference. As for subs and dubs, I personally prefer the subbed version because clair and Lumire both have skilled voice actors and they match their characters well. One particular grievance I have with the dubbed version is that Lumire sounds more malicious and snarky than refined.

If you want to watch Kiddy Grade, it is available on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/kiddy-grade)  in both subbed and dubbed editions. Coalgirls also has the movie summaries.

**Vandread (2000)** [12/26]

[[MAL]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/180/Vandread) [[Wikipedia]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandread)

Another series by Gonzo, *Vandread* is also a sci-fi series set in the distant future, but is set in a dystopic universe where men and women have been diverted to different planets. The male protagonist Hibiki Tokai steals a mecha to particpate in a war against the female society.

I actually watched the first 13 episodes of this back when I was a kid, but never found closure about the story until I remembered it now. To put it simply, this appears to be basically *Infinite Stratos*' spiritual ancestor. Hibiki is one of only 3 men in an entire ship of women, although Hibiki is considerably less dense than the Supermassive Ichika Object.

*Vandread* actually makes use of its setting as well. There are some slice-of-life episodes which revolve around more romance and relationship building, while some episodes are jam-packed with action and further the explanation of why this alternate universe has men and women separated.

The animation style is very smooth for being 14 years old, but the CGI sequences do look somewhat out of place. I guess it would be better than getting reused shots similar to how the Gundam series went about it. The character design is typical of the 2000s series and fanservice isn't that over the top, and it is also refreshing to see a series that doesn't have every semi-important female clamouring over the male protagonist.

If you want to watch Vandread, it is available on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/vandread) in both subbed and dubbed editions. It also has the first two movies available in only the subbed editions.

**Shiki 22/22**

All I gotta say after watching the last EP is, Muroiand Sonoka is ready to take over another village soon...
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Psycho-Pass (22/22)**. I wasn't entirely impressed with the first half of the show (too many detective cliches, felt too episodic), but holy crap. I guess I should've learned not to doubt Urobuchi.

Intellecutally, this might be my favorite of his shows, which I wasn't expecting. His usual theme of [spoilers](/s "anti-utilitarianism was handled a lot more fairly than I was expecting, showing how effective it was at actually keeping peace and governing people despite dehumanizing them at the same time. Akane's speech about what the law really means actually floored me - it was intelligent yet passionate, a way to reconcile the greater good with human validation. Sybil might be the letter of utilitarianism's law, but Akane felt like the spirit of what that philosophy aims for.")

But the best part came towards the very end: [last episode spoilers](/s "despite Akane's best efforts, Kougami *doesn't* change. Akane's viewpoint might be wonderful, it might be correct, but not everyone is Akane. Even considering his usual bloodbaths, that seemed like one of Urobuchi's darkest moments - admitting that for all the good that comes from humanity, a large part of it is also deeply flawed and irrepressible. But, of course, the show ends on an optimistic note with Akane standing up to Sybil. While Kougami's final action in the show represents the bad side of human nature, Akane's represents the good, the drive to find a better way.")

This is one of the few shows I've walked away from feeling like I've learned something. The first half didn't grab me, but this ended up being one of my favorites. Consider me surprised. **9/10**
>> ARTICLE
I really liked it too, I just wish that the characters were more compelling. Also, the philosopher references felt a little ...*referential*. They weren't always pertinent to the theme at hand and seemed like insertions or afterthoughts at times. 

The antagonist of the show, however, is endlessly compelling and in my opinion possibly as "flawed" as you say. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I agree about a lot of the characters. They're pretty endearing and fun to watch, but they're more representatives of different viewpoints and philosophies than fleshed-out human beings (something that also happened in Fate/Zero). That said, I thought Akane was a ridiculously good MC. She reminded me a lot of Hajime from Gatchaman Crowds, except better because there was actual *character development*.

Also, while the philosophy references were just sort of there to be there at first, they seemed to get more purposeful towards the end. They're one of the many little things that improved in the show's second half.

I'm at episode 13 right now, and the episode with "the hunting game" was pretty amazing. Really digging the antagonist so far, excited to see what's to come.

Just finished Kill la Kill this week after having dropped it two times before. 8/10 

I didn't really like the premise of the show during the majority of the first cour, but I'm really glad I finished it through this time. At the beginning it just seemed like Ryuuko was just mindlessly fighting and beating the crap out of people for 8 episodes, but MAN did it get intense during the 2nd half. Marathoned the last 10ish episodes for a great finish!
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly how I felt. First half I was starting to feel like it was turning into Bleach-style "must go defeat the next enemy!" but KLK really made all of that worth it. Every character mattered and the plot was really interesting. I'll definitely rewatch it, very enjoyable.

I have a few comments on your opinion on Suzumiya there (Suzumiya = the show), and most of them are not good.

Suzumiya is definitely NOT a slice of life. Seeing it as such is reducing it to something it isn't. It is much more than a "slice of life with a twist". I see a slice of life show as something that can happen IRL, and this certainly cannot.

Also, the only "filler" episode is the last episode, Someday in the Rain, since it wasn't in the original Light Novels. Everything else is perfectly canon, and happens in the original material as well. Calling it "filler" is again demoting those episodes to something there aren't, and since the majority of the show is made from those random arcs that don't actually contribute to the bigger story, saying that might make some people not watch the show, when they really shouldn't because of that reason. The only exception is the EE, and even then I think that everyone should watch it fully at least once, although I can understand if they don't.

Finally, the Kyon theory. Recommending this show because of that is something that is honestly a bad idea. It creates confusion where it doesn't need to exist to a first-time watcher and it, so far, isn't canon either, so I believe everyone should get their own conclusions about whether they believe in the theory or not after watching the entire show.

The conclusion I get is that you didn't understand this show. I know I'm being a little self-centered here, but Suzumiya is much more than simply a Slice of Life with random episodes. It is an anime that can barely be compared to any other in equal terms. 

Watching it in broadcast order is also not a good idea for first-time watchers either, since it again confuses more than it should and it actually only applies to the first season's episodes. It isn't the real way to watch the show as you said, it is an option that only someone who is familiar with the show already should take in my opinion.

I'm sorry if I was a bit aggressive there, but this is my favorite show and seeing someone not getting it fully makes me a bit sad.

It is a bit hard to explain Suzumiya, but I'll do my best. 

First, the thing that grabs my attention is the setting, the first 6 episodes (chronologically, that is, the "Melancholy" part of the show). God lives in the physical world but doesn't know about her powers, she can destroy the world at will, the other members of the Brigade are all some sort of supernatural beings (and she doesn't know it) and she needs to have a reason to not destroy the world she finds boring. This setting is absolutely brilliant. My favorite episodes of the show are these first ones (mainly the 6th), because they set up everything else that happens or will happen in the show. Everything else happens because of one or more of these reasons, so that may make those next episodes more boring at first glance.

But then come in the characters. And this is where this series truly shines in my opinion. Those episodes are not about the story itself, since it has already "ended", they are about the characters and how they evolve and interact in that setting. 

Kyon is my favorite character. I love his comments and his entire "normal" view of the situations, and how he, slowly, begins to like the situation he found himself in. The fact that he is so normal in the midst of that freak show is what makes him such a good character. He essentially serves as a balance to the rest of the cast.

Haruhi is such a charismatic character (like her or not), and pretty much everything in the show revolves around her, but it is really interesting to see her grow, also slowly, as a person ; as the series goes on, she becomes more and more willing to accept the real world. Also, the things she comes up with are just hilarious for me.

The rest of the Brigade is a bit less prominent, mostly serving as a plot lines, but Nagato deserves a special mention, since it is very evident that she becomes more "human" as the series goes on as well. 

I also like the entire dynamic of the characters, and that dynamic is also a big part of what makes the show so interesting and those "filler" episodes so fun to watch. These are the reasons why watching it in broadcast order is not a good idea, because it is very difficult to actually get the growth of the characters.

Disappearance is another story altogether. I watched it much later than the rest of the show, and still haven't re-watched it. It is not the reason I love the show so much, since it was already my favorite before watching the movie. It has a very different passing from those random episodes I like so much for the reasons I stated above. It feels like Suzumiya, but at the same time it has a very different and refreshing feeling to it, being much more heavy and dramatic. It nevertheless complements those episodes beautifully and expands the character development already in the show. It is a great movie, you should watch it ASAP.

I think that is basically it. Essentially, the growth and the dynamic of the characters, complemented with such a good story, is why I like this series so much, and why it is such a special show. A normal Slice of Life (I've seen a lot of those so I can argue) doesn't typically have the character dynamic and the interesting stories this show is able to produce, since it tries to be realistic. This show, however, is much more bold, throwing all kinds of weird ad interesting stories at you, but at the same time developing its characters in its own special way. And it does it really well, for me at least.

I think that is the biggest post I've ever written on reddit, but it also helped me understand why I like the show so much. Thanks.

I didn't really thought much about the rating you gave, since everyone gives ratings in a different way. I give it a 8.5/10 (or, in my system, a 17/20), because it has some problems that keep it from really deserving to be on the top (18 and above). In a side note, my rating system is universal, so things Slice of Life shows tend to have worse ratings than, say, an action-packed show, although some of them are my favorite shows. However, if the show does its characters really well then it will deserve a good rating (like Clannad, despite me not liking the show).

I kind of understand now why you didn't like the show that much. It doesn't have an underlining story past the first 6 episodes, returning each time to a more or less status quo which is typical of slice of life shows, though in this case the status quo changes ever so slightly like I mentioned. If it is a matter of personal taste, then I have no objections.

Now, regarding the broadcast order vs chronological order. I think I watched the show years ago, the first season, in broadcast order (I was quite young so I honestly don't remember), but after that I watched it in chronological order every time. Although I still believe that chronological is the better option for first time viewers, I know very few people who actually watched the show the first time in the broadcast order, so I can't exactly tell you the advantages of the it. I can see that the show is tightly written, which allows for the broadcast order to exist in the first place, and the LN are also very random in their stories (the recent post here about Suzumiya's timeline is very good in explaining the order of the arcs), so maybe the best way to enjoy the show is the broadcast order. Like I said, I can't tell you unfortunately. If you didn't find it an obstacle and could understand the character growth and dynamic then I have no objections either.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I love the series also but I honestly completely disagree with a lot of your opinions. 

I would definitely say Suzumiya is a SOL. This isn't a bad thing. SOL can easily be just as well-written/meaningful/etc as any other genre. Therefore, saying so doesn't "reduce" it to anything. A SOL is just a genre category. The series may cover other genres as well but a large portion of it most definitely fits in the SOL category (note: I think you are misdefining SOL by saying it needs to be something that can happen IRL - it is a very hard category to properly describe but I can think of numerous shows that wouldn't fit that description - the best way I can think to describe it is as shows that simply has characters living life in their own world, supernatural or not).

I agree that the show should not be recommended based on a theory, but I completely disagree with watching in chronological order first. I actually prefer chronological now but broadcast order allows for the viewer to get used to the characters before hitting the first climax of the show with the end of the melancholy arc (the character growth in chronological is probably superior overall, but I think it is more detrimental to have better character growth that largely takes place after the climax than still good but slightly worse character growth that takes place before the climax if you are a first time viewer). IMO, chronological only starts to be better after you've seen the shows so you can bypass this as you already know the characters. Also, as vafrous said, broadcast makes the show seem like a mystery as you try to figure out what is going on (the fact that it may be a little confusing is not necessarily a bad thing). Watching in chronological order takes away this factor (but if you are rewatching the show it isn't there anyway, once again making chronological superior for rewatches but not first time viewers).

As a side not, I agree that the show shouldn't be called filler. I do find it amusing that Someday in the Rain is the only episode that could be called filler since it is one of my favorite episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok, the Slice of Life thing might be my own wrong view of what it means, but I always believed that it meant a story that could happen IRL. Something that relates to living the daily life of the characters would be a genre of itself. Aria the Animation is a perfect example of this. 

Anyway, that matter aside, I didn't meant to say that slice of life shows are bad. In fact, I love many SoL shows (Haganai, Chuunibyou and many others). The thing is, if you brand Suzumiya as a SoL without any mention to what actually makes it special, most people will not pick it up precisely because it is just a SoL.

The broadcast vs chronological is a very complex subject. I still believe that the best way to enjoy the show is the chronological way, but broadcast is fine as long as the person who is watching knows it is being aired out of order on purpose to put the climax in the end, and can understand everything about the show anyway. It does make the show really special, so I'm all in for it to be an option. I also don't like the broadcast order since technically only the first season has the broadcast order, the second season aired with its episodes chronologically, so watching it in broadcast is just slapping the 2nd season episodes after the 1st seasons'.

Oh, Someday in the Rain. I hate that episode so much. It is completely useless, boring, and it doesn't even appear in the LN. I praise it for being bold by making me sitting there watching someone reading a book, but it really doesn't add anything to the overall experience (unlike the Endless Eight). I've already heard any argument regarding this episode so you don't have to bother. I do find it amusing that so many people like this awful thing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, SOL is very difficult to define. People seem to constantly define it differently and it's impossible to say what is the right way (there probably isn't one). I agree with the conditions for watching broadcast order. If someone has trouble understanding the show at all because it isn't chronological it obviously wouldn't be the way to go. I always find it amusing how people can love the same show but have entirely different opinions of it.

What are these commentaries?  This is the first I've heard of them 
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
What really makes it special is that the author himself wrote the commentary which is why they're so in character 
>> ARTICLE
The endless eight was made because the studio got the budget to make the Disappearance movie, which was originally going to be part of the series, so they replaced those episodes with the endless eight.
>> ARTICLE
The commentary is probably one of the best features of the Monogatari series - It's really unfortunate that it wasn't included with the english releases outside of Bakemonogatari.

The Nisemonogatari commentary is slowly being translated, but it's a fair amount of effort, so only the first 2 episodes are done just yet.(those 2 episodes in particular are special in that they feature two commentary tracks - so it equates to 4 episodes worth of commentary)

As to the whole endless eight debacle - A fair few people seem to think it was to make Disappearance able to be made into movie format, as it wouldn't have been anywhere near as good in the serial format.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion [26/26]** Well, I finished it. I have to say that I'm really impressed with how the story was constructed. While the last 2 episodes were confusing as fuck and difficult to keep track of, in the end, I understood what NGE was trying to say. 

And strangely, I didn't find Shinji annoying at all. Asuka was the most annoying, but her attitude was explained well, so I can forgive that. All in all, I think NGE is a great show and I don't regret watching all 26 episodes in the slightest. 

Sure, the show can get a lot if flak for its presentation of the show's message. Pretentious? Maybe. But I found something deep within NGE and because of that I have to make this show one of my favorites. 

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica [12/12]** And with this, the Urobuchi Trifecta is complete. 

I want to tell a story. A year or two ago, DutchFarmers decided to check out Madoka Magica. He got to the first witch scene and said "What is this surrealist bullshit. Dropped."

Needless to say, DutchFarmers was wrong about Madoka Magica. This show is without a doubt one of the most riveting things I have seen. Pacing, atmosphere, and story were perfect. While I didn't find it as thought provoking as NGE, Madoka Magica is a show that deserves the praise it gets. 

**Bakemonogatari [7/15]** I know a lot of people like this show. I like it too. But I don't like how SHAFT throws in a head tilt whenever it can. Also, I don't like how the city always seems lifeless. Still, it's a good show. I just don't think it'll end up being one if my favorites.

Man you're king on a classic marathon

It's really weird that the first witch scene, one of the most interesting things to happen in the early Madoka episodes, is what turned you *away* from the show. I think most viewers find that scene pretty cool. I still remember the first time I saw that scene, it was interesting enough to leave an impression.
>> ARTICLE
Something was really wrong with me that day
>> ARTICLE
Glad you liked NGE, but did you watch the ending movie, End Of Evangelion? It replaces the last two episodes and gives a clearer ending to the show as a whole, and is an excellent movie in itself, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't EoE really depressing? I plan to watch it, but I'm not sure how satisfied I'll be.
>> ARTICLE
EoE is more mindfuck than depressing. Do not watch if you need to any math or shit within the next few dayd.
>> ARTICLE
~~It depends on how you want to take it~~ It probably is pretty fucking depressing for most, but it was a satisfying ending, for me anyway.
>> ARTICLE
**NGE** - As others have said, End of Eva is quite necessary to complete the series. Simply put, it's what episodes 25 and 26 could have been if Gainax hadn't run its budget dry. It also incorporates Shinji's decisions in those two episodes with physical results.

**Madoka** - The movie series is well worth the watch if you enjoyed the series. The first two movies are basically film-length showings of the 12 episodes, which may be fun to watch if you're looking for a  rewatch with some Shaft edits. But if not, the third movie Rebellion has a very interesting presentation of a continuation.

**Bake** - Of course everybody has their tastes for animation direction, I would just like to point out that the Monogatari series loves to play upon character perspective. The first season is almost entirely Araragi's, but it may give subtle insight into his mindset when seeing the lifeless city, beautiful Senjougahara, even the those [black screen] blinks of his eyes.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend not watching Rebellion. I'd go into details but it would be spoilers. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't recommend against watching something simply because of my subjective dislike of it. Sure Rebellion was controversial, but who's to say that /u/DutchFarmers won't enjoy it?
>> ARTICLE
Just some questions about the Madoka movie. 

Is it absolutely necessary that I watch this to experience Madoka Magica in all it's glory? I was pretty happy with the show's conclusion. 

Does the movie mess with the time line? I watched 3 min of the opening and was confused why they were showing Madoka's home life especially because of her wish
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I loved Rebellion. It was a great movie. A lot of people did not like it for some very big reasons. It basically comes down to the way you interpret one of the characters.

Otherwise it is a beautiful movie. Excellent action scenes, a lot of good character development, and an excellent twist. I personally think that it should be seen.
>> ARTICLE
The third movie flows perfectly with the timeline of the series. It is a little confusing in the beginning, but it becomes clear later on what is happening. 

As for whether or not you need to watch it, it seems about 50/50. Some people love it, others hate it. There's not really a general consesus from what I've seen. Without getting into spoilers, personally, I liked the end of the movie, but I could see why it'd make some people mad. I'd recommend it, but cautiously.

> Puella Magi Madoka Magica

I just watched this yesterday in a single sitting.  I wasn't planning on it, but once I got 6 episodes in I needed to know how it ended.

I have to say, the character development of Homura is probably one of the most impressive developments I've seen.  For most of the series, I kept thinking, "Ugh, Madoka is so weak.  She just follows everybody around and cries a lot.  Why is Homura such a jerk?", and then episode 10 hits and *everything* is explained in such a satisfying way.

The ending was confusing and I think Madoka could have used her wish better, but overall it was a great series with surprising plot twists.  It also did a good job giving the viewer a constant feeling of dread for the characters.  "Maybe things will get better for them in the next episode.  Shit, it's worse.  Well maybe things will be better for them in the *next* episode.  Shit."
>> ARTICLE
[Madoka Magica](/s "In case you're interested in my input, I actually think that Madoka used her wish pretty damn well, all things considered. After I finished the series I was thinking "wow, did she need to do that? That seems awfully extreme, surely with as much power as she had, she could have used a much simpler wish that just fixed the problem without this crazy sacrifice"").

[cont.](/s "But then I remembered the law of equilibrium that Kyuubey lays out earlier on: Whatever amount of hope your wish spreads, it'll cause you to spread an equal amount of despair as a witch. In other words, Madoka had to be very careful not to just create a horribly powerful witch that destroys everything. This immediately disqualifies any of the obvious wishes she could try, and it also means that if she's around as a magical girl after the wish is made, it's going to end badly").

[cont.](/s "By wishing to destroy all witches with her own hands, she allowed herself to paradoxically destroy her own witch. Her wish was going to have a big cost, and she found a way to inflict that cost on herself rather than on everyone around her the way most magical girls do when they fall").

[cont.](/s "Could she have just wished away the hope/despair equilibrium law? Well, if so, then yeah, maybe she could have done better, but given that the hope/despair balance thing was thematically central to the story, eliminating it wouldn't have been very satisfying").
>> ARTICLE
[Well](/s  "what if Madoka had said, 'I wish that in the next timeline Homura jumps too, the Kyuubey race doesn't exist' and then had Homura jump through time?  That would make the new timeline void of witches, and Homura would get to start over again with Madoka without worrying about the whole witch/kyuubey thing.  Sure she would still die and the current timeline would remain fucked, but the other timelines that Homura left would still be fucked despite the wish Madoka made in the show, so why not go for just *one* timeline where everything is fixed?")
>> ARTICLE
[Madoka Magica](/s "Part of what Madoka wants, and I feel she states this more clearly in the manga than in the TV series, is that she wants magical girls to be able to trust in their own wishes right to the end. She wants them to be content with the fact that their wishes and all their effort really did improve the world around them, and that their struggles aren't futile by design. As such, I don't think Madoka wanted to eliminate magical girls. Their trials and tribulations, especially Homura's, meant something positive and powerful to her, and she wanted to preserve that").

[cont.](/s "That being said, if you consider wishes where Madoka lets herself and her timeline die, but sends Homura to a new one that she alters for the better, I'm sure there's a way to do that, it's true. I hadn't considered that. It wouldn't have been a bad ending either, because it would capture Madoka's selflessness very well, but I guess even selfless Madoka has a survival instinct in the end").

Nisekoi. God, I'm loving it.

**Yu Yu Hakusho** - (34/112)


I'm finally in the Dark Tournament arc, my favorite! Seriously, the Dark Tournament arc kicks ass. I love seeing all the new characters with their unique powers. Even though I know exactly what's going to happen having read the manga several times, it's still pretty interesting.


**Fullmetal Alchemist** - (1/51)


I'm only one episode in and already I'm in love with this show. Edward is sort of a cynical dickhole, but I like him anyway for some reason. I think it's interesting they got an actual kid to do Al's voice rather than just a woman doing a kid's voice, like they usually. He's not half bad, either. The whole world they're setting up is pretty awesome. I like the way they're explaining alchemy as a science and all the laws and rules that go with it. Being interested in science, I guess it's only natural I'm drawn to something like that.


**Death Note** - (3/37)


I decided to give Death Note a rewatch now that it's back up on Netflix. It's actually better than I remember it being. The art looks amazing and the voice acting is pretty damn solid. Of course, the story is fantastic, but that goes without saying. Light's cheesy "I will be a god! Justice!" lines get on my nerves a bit, but thankfully they're not too frequent. Overall, Death Note's still as solid as I remember it being three years ago, if not even better.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, you are gonna love FMA! But don't expect Edward to be a cynical dickhole the entire time, he is that very often, but he is actually a nice guy.
>> ARTICLE
If you like Fullmetal Alchemist, I would recommend checking out Brotherhood afterwards. Some people prefer the first series, Fullmetal Alchemist, but IMO Brotherhood has a much stronger story, since it follows the manga. None the less, both are really great. :D
>> ARTICLE
So is Brotherhood essentially a remake of the first series?
>> ARTICLE
Not really, no. They're quite different after around the tenth episode. The reason they made brotherhood, was due to how different the first Fullmetal Alchemist series was from the manga. That was due to it still being ongoing and unfinished, when the first FMA was running. Once the manga was done, they decided to make new series that followed the manga's storyline. :D
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I would strongly recommend that you first watch FMA: Brotherhood instead of the original. Basically, the original series had to improvise a lot and come up with its own ending since it surpassed the manga, while FMA: Brotherhood follows the manga the whole way through. This is essentially the defining difference. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
What I meant is you should watch FMA: Brotherhood before watching the original, since it is the follows what the author/mangaka had in mind. Also, if you only want to watch one or the other, definitely watch FMA: Brotherhood. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Well, that is an opinion. But I think that FMA: Brotherhood is overall preferred by most people, considering that its rank 1 on MAL, and also people tend to prefer the author's original vision.
>> ARTICLE
>it follows the manga

It's a remake until the point where the original anime split off from the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Yu Yu Hakusho is a classic. My only problem with that show are the first few episodes. However that is just me being anxious and wanting to skip ahead every time I rewatch it.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, I love hakusho I'm rewatching for the umpteenth time and I'm in the dark tournament saga too. But yes the first I think 5 episodes have a completely different tone than the rest of the show.

When I first saw the show on Adult Swim/Toonami ten years ago, it was the tone of the first 5 episodes that I loved...everything after that was a disappointment for me :/

Blue Excorsist. Been on my list since I first heard about the manga and never got to it until now. Loving it thus far.

Just thought I should let you know that it's an anime only ending for the show, but the manga I believe is still continuing.

Taken from the /r/TrueAnime thread:

***The Tatami Galaxy*** (9-11/11)

I got into a brief conversation with /u/Vintagecoats after finishing episode 11, and I think I came up with the most succinct way to describe that finale: 

*["It felt like a phenomenal punchline to the set-up of a really long joke that I wasn't sure was going to deliver."](https://twitter.com/cptngarlock/status/479726534966927360)*

Because each episode prior to episode 10 was a story that, as far as I could tell, was a repitition of the same themes, merely placed into a different story and rotating the cast of characters, I have to admit I started to get a little tired. Shows like *Mushishi* didn't cause that problem because, despite similar premises, the themes differ constantly, and I think I prefer that set-up than the reverse. Furthermore, I could roughly predict what the ending was going to be because of how hard the show hammered in certain ideas; this meant that a great ending would have to rely solely on great execution rather than the introduction of a new idea or some surprising conclusion. 

Thankfully, I needn't be worried. The ending went roughly exactly as I'd hoped, but also much better than I'd expected. Watashi came to the conclusion he needed to, Ozu's role in the story was shown from a different perspective, and Watashi grasped for the opportunity he needed to. Honestly, it was as perfect an ending as I could've expected, and I expected quite a lot. I'm very happy to add another 10 to my list (and two in one day, too! I finished the finale on the same day that *Ping Pong the Animation* ended; I'm quite a lucky guy.)

Still...I'm a little saddened that I didn't get the opportunity to get to know the rest of the cast better. We were shown different "faces", but I don't feel that I got to *know* them very well. Perhaps the specials will fix that?

***[Wandering Son](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko)*** - (1-5/12) 

This show has taken me completely by surprise. An adaptation of a highly acclaimed manga, it deals with transsexualism, gender identity, regular old growing up and the onset of puberty. Thats a lot of interesting, and quite frankly difficult, material to handle. Given anime/mangas predilection for fetishizing transsexualism and cross-dressing, a show like this is an extremely welcome breath of fresh air. 

But its not just because of it intelligently tackling LGBT characters that makes *Wandering Son* so amazing (although it certainly helps!) Whats amazing is  how sensitively the show is treating its characters, and how easily the show makes you care about them without resorting to crying festivals or early drama to make you care. In fact, its kind of amazing how muted the shows dramatic moments can be, given who its screen composer is, the (in)famous Mari Okada. Clearly, this isnt another *NagiAsu* or *AnoHana* - this is a *Toradora* or a *Hanasaku Iroha*, a case of strong dramatic material being adapted by someone who clearly has writing chops but needs good material to restrain herself.

Were not given massive info-dumping either; instead, were allowed to piece together information from offhand clues dropped everywhere, letting viewers come to their own aha! so thats whats going on! moments on themselves. Given how rarely anime respects a viewers intelligence, this is *again* another welcome breath of fresh air. 

Although not everyone gets a big spotlight on them, the show takes the time to flesh out even the support and background characters, and makes them feel alive and real, not merely as support for the main characters. One thing that many single-cour dramas do terribly is simltaneously juggling multiple dramatic sideplots along with a main one. That rarely works - you just dont have the time to develop enough audience investment to be able to handle so much drama and not make it look cheap or have to use the *Clannad* style of dramatic storytelling aka *THESE GIRLS ARE CRYING, DONT YOU FEEL BAD FOR THEM*? Again, the show handles the drama very deftly so far, and Okadas great writing skills are allowed to shine without imploding into a simpery mess. 

If theres one things resembling a flaw with this show, is how unbelievable its premise is. These kids are first year middle schoolers, and yet they are as calm and adult as youd expect a college kid to be. Frankly, they seem almost TOO emotionally sound and stable. On top of this, we cant forget the series premise - almost every central character is LGBT in some way, and its not like Japan is known for their sexual progressiveness. Why is there so little bullying? This kids dont seem nearly insecure enough to feel like middle schoolers discovering that their sexual and gender identities arent exactly typical. I guess, though, its needed, otherwise the show would get bogged down in dealing with external conflicts rather than the conflicts between the characters and their personalities (which, I repeat, the show handles *marvelously.*)

To be quite honest, Im extremely surprised that the show has flown below so many radars. Ive barely heard anyone talk about it, and the only one I can remember is /u/violaxcore. It seems so good that I can only guess that 1) it was advertised for shit or 2) people got uncomfortable with the premise. 

Gaaah fuck. This is such a good show. [*Such a good show.*](http://i.imgur.com/1coFybi.png) Im already giving this a 9, and so help me god I dont know if I can handle giving out another 10 after giving out 10s for *The Tatami Galaxy* and *Ping Pong The Animation* this past week.

Hells. I had a massive internal debate when ***I*** gave Hourou Musuko a 10/10 perfect score [11 weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/22chrm/spoilers_so_what_did_yall_watch_this_past_week/cglujmd), and I had only given out a grand total of ten of them before this one finally appeared on my radar. (Although it looks like you're a bit tougher on anime ratings than I am. Just a little bit, though.)

As to why it isn't on everyone's list, I think it is because of the subject matter. Given this sub's average age, I don't see many of them lining up to watch a title that involves legitimately transgendered characters. Moe-as-fuck crossdressers that make people laugh? Absolutely. But this one would be too far outside people's (read: straight sexually-insecure teenage males') comfort zones to be very popular. 

But gods, that ED can still make me cry in only seconds. So. Damn. Good.

Hey judgymcjudgerson glad you know how most of the 180,000 people on this sub feel. Please tell me how I feel about lots of stuff, I'd really like to know.

So I'll be expecting your review of Wandering Son in next week's roundup then. After all, if I'm so very wrong about you, you must be extraordinarily eager to watch this show.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, "calm and adult" is the last thing I would use to describe most college kids I've seen. But for middle school kids, that is still above what I would expect from them too.
>> ARTICLE
>If theres one things resembling a flaw with this show, is how unbelievable its premise is. These kids are first year middle schoolers, and yet they are as calm and adult as youd expect a college kid to be.

Heh, that's the same point of criticism that I made, and from what I've seen, it seems like most other criticis also notice that. The characters are so so good at handling middle-school life that they don't even seem human anymore. You say their mental ages are on the level of college kids? Hell, I say they're 90-year-old Zen masters. 

Not that I mind too much(as I also mentioned in my post), because the show is just so amazing to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it does seem to be the big flaw here. And it's a surprising one, too - typically, we complain about characters not acting mature *enough*, but here we're complaining about them being *too* mature. 

Although honestly, I prefer "little brats being too mature and emotionally stable for their age" over "adults being to immature and emotional unstable for their own good" haha
>> ARTICLE
>Although honestly, I prefer "little brats being too mature and emotionally stable for their age" over "adults being to immature and emotional unstable for their own good" haha

Yeah, exactly. It's unbeliavably pleasant to see the other side of it for a change. I've frequently had the "frustrated viewer" response and gone "God, just say it already!", only to have the character actually do exactly what I wanted them to do. It's so satisfying.

And somehow, the show only gets better with each episode(on average).
>> ARTICLE
**NHK ni Youkoso!** (Completed) - I really liked this show even though it seemed to throw everything for loops. It was really good at disclosing that most dreams do not come true. Most of the things you wanted to do in life fail and you end up with pain, suffering, and shit. But life is about overcoming that and becoming satisfied with the path you have taken. This show did a great job of making the main character utterly disgusting and honestly pitiful while still maintaing a balance of not entering cringe humor which I absolutely cannot stand. I was a bit bored at the beginning and was thinking why did I start this stupid show but it rapidly picked up pace. All in all it felt very real (most parts anyway) and presented a very good show about interpersonal relationships, life, and being a shut-in. I want to give it a (9/10) but I am really not into these kinds of shows so a (8.4/10) will suffice. 

**Kimi no Todoke** (13/25) 

Honestly I was a bit doubtful coming into this show. I was gonna watch **Katanagatari** but my friend told me this was amazing. I have heard that it is basically one long drawn out episode that includes a kiss. I have also seen the art style and am not really attracted to it. But, I watched Ping Pong and Sidonia so there really is not a reason art should detract me from it. My friend told me to watch it and so far I am enjoying it. I dislike how so many of the characters are outright bitches though. There is an extent to how exaggerated high school girls are. A lot of them are bitches but this show just overdoes it imo. The goal of this show is to basically make you get a heart boner while you watch Sawako makes friends and progress her love life with Kazehaya. There was an arc that was dragged out because of exaggerated miscomprehension that I was not really a big fan of and the first episode was honestly extremely cringey but I cannot help but like this show. It does exactly what Isshukan Friends does for me but to a lesser degree. I am currently looking at a 7.4 which is pretty high for me since my mean score is like a 5.7. I am a fan of the comedy and for some ungodly reason, one of shoujo as well so this show lines pretty well with my tastes. On the other note, Ryu is best girl.  
>> ARTICLE
Ryu is the man.  He does whatever he wants, he keeps things simple, he says what he wants and never too much.  He's also athletic.  

Ryu is alpha as shit.

**Gintama** (12/201) - More character introductions! I'll admit that it's a fun show if I'm in the mood for it. Otose has more depth to her than I expected, and she's my favorite character so far. Sadaharu's cute, though I'm wondering what his (her?) story is.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (4/64) - Ah, Scar and Shou Tucker. It's like uncovering buried memories from the original series, and again I don't mind it at all.

**Baccano!** (6/16) - This is starting to feel like a series I should marathon rather than watch a couple episodes every week. Good show, but I'm having difficulty remembering all the connections between the different groups of characters.

**ef: A Tale of Memories** (4/12) - Conflict between characters, right on schedule. Still a refreshing contrast to the other series I'm watching.

**Attack on Titan** (2/25) - Started watching this because a friend just jumped into part of the fandom. Whee crapsack world. I'm trying to figure out how there's been a stalemate for 100 years.

It'll somewhat explain itself with a fact being revealed later on in the series (about AoT)

**To Aru Kagaku no Railgun S** (1-17/24)
____

In quite a shift from Index II being a huge step down from Index I, Railgun S is actually a kind of amazing step up from Railgun. It started off with the first couple episodes being pretty standard fare I expected from the series, but once the Sisters arc got rolling it got to a whole new level. The atmosphere was fantastic, the action was gorgeous, and I would honestly have a hard time finding anything done wrong with the story. If anything, I'd complain that it was tied down to Index which it can't do anything about (which means it fell from phenomenal to just entertaining in the steps toward the conclusion of the arc).

Anyway I can't see myself giving it anything less than an 8/10 when I finish it later today unless this last arc ends up being the worst Railgun arc yet. 

PS. Episode 5 is probably on my personal list of best individual anime episodes. Such a fantastic mix of positivity, melancholy, and inevitable despair. One of the few times where they really took advantage of the fact most viewers had seen Index and knew how things had to end.
>> ARTICLE
"unless this last arc ends up being the worst Railgun arc yet"

Which is unfortunatly the case. After the absolutely amazing Sisters Arc it's really impressive how laughably bad the filler arc manages to be, especially considering they had perfectly fine material they could adapt to fill the remaining episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I know people tend to hate that arc but I actually really enjoyed it despite being silly. I appreciated having something more popcorn-y and less dark after the sisters arc, as good as it was.
>> ARTICLE
The whole arc was just so badly written, I couldn't even enjoy it in this "so bad it's good" way. The antagonists were pathetic, and Misaka suffered from one of the worst cases of plot-retardation i've seen in a long time. Also, it directly contradicted Misaka's stance on involving her friends with the Darkness of Academy City (if those wannabe-Kiharas can even be considered part of it). The whole Tree Diagram Remnant Arc was about nothing but what happens when they get involved, and here this suddenly isn't a big deal at all.

Regarding something more popcorn-y after the Sisters Arc: They literally had a story about a summer vacation that could have been adapted instead of writing a filler arc. It would have brought the possibility for a light-hearted filler beach episode, while showing off some cool new sides of Misaka's skills in later episodes. It also would have introduced magic in the Railgun series. Even the length of the arc was optimal for the number of episodes remaining. All in all it was the obvious choice for a change of pace after the Sisters Arc, but it seems that Nagai can only be happy when he fucks Railgun up.

I actually really liked Index II due to how much we got to see of Accelerator and Last Order.

**Kimi ni Todoke S1 (18/25)** (Watched 2-18 this week)

Crunchyroll omitted the 16th episode because it was a recap apparently, but yeah. I don't know why I like this so much. I feel like my masculinity is being ripped away every time I watch another episode, but I can't stop. I already know I'm probably going to keep watching this until I finish it next week or the week after, but I can't quite understand why I like this so much. Everything is just so heartwarming. Plus, I'm not into dudes, but Kazehaya is just so dreamy. I'd do him. *No homo*

**Monster (35/74)** (Watched 21-35 this week)

This is really dark. I love the characters though, even the ones who are after Tenma, like Lunge. The entire premise is great so far and once I start watching it it's kinda hard for me to put down, despite it being almost unbearably slow. It's great though. I stopped at the part where [Monster spoilers](/s "Tenma is setting up on top of a book case in the library, getting ready to shoot Johan.") Can't wait to see what happens next. 

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (12/27)** (Watched 10-12 this week)

I never thought I would be able to watch this again. Thank god my brother finally decided to, I was *just* about to give up and move on without him, so he had great timing. If you can't remember, these episodes  [TTGL spoilers](/s "were the ones where Simon was just finishing 'getting over' Kamina's death.") 10 and 11 were great, but 12 felt like a major filler episode. I laughed pretty hard at Yoko's swimsuit being less revealing than her regular outfit.

**Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 (12/25)** (Watched 12 this week)

I never thought I would laugh so hard at this show. Lelouch commanding [R2 spoilers](/s "where his double should go") was like pretty much like a war scene he was commanding. Obviously it didn't matter as much because, well, it wasn't a war scenario but a game. I enjoyed this episode, but I need to focus on one or two anime instead of jumping around all of these shows I'm watching.

**Oreimo S1 "True Ending" (4/4)** (Watched 1-4 this week)

I actually really preferred this to the original ending. I liked the extra arc with Kuroneko and how they [Oreimo spoilers](/s "had to make friends with the new girl (whose name I forgot) to overcome the problem of the deadline for Kuroneko's game"). I feel like we had more development with Kyosuke than before because of [Oreimo spoilers](/s "him losing his sister for so long.") Since I liked this more than the main series, I gave this part a **8.5/10** as opposed to the 8 I gave S1.    

**Mushi-shi (1/26)** (Watched 1 this week)

I watched only one episode of this but I have to say it was awesome. I don't know why, but the atmosphere in this show is just amazing. I can't wait to watch more. It also genuinely made me feel *happy,* which is something not many anime have done for me, yet. Sure I've laughed, but I've never really sat down after watching an episode (or even a series) of anime and said, 'wow, this made me happy.' So, I'm definitely going to come back to this one. Too good. 

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Rebellion** (Movie watched twice this week)

Watch 1: Okay, I love the TV series and the first two movies. I'm sure I would like this if I had some sort of idea about what I just watched. Must.. rewatch.

Watch 2: I think I totally understand this now. I really liked pretty much every aspect of this film. The only downside to me was that the art style was really crazy during certain parts, but that's not really enough of a downside for me to knock it down from a **10/10.** Also, I think it would be stupid for Shaft to not make another TV series or film in this series. I feel like there would be an uproar if they didn't with that ending. ^^^^^^^^Homura ^^^^^^^^still ^^^^^^^^best ^^^^^^^^girl!

Well, next week is movie week for me! Watching **Redline**, **Ghost in the Shell**, **Wolf Children**, **Colorful**, **Paprika**, **Garden of Words**, and **The Girl Who Leapt Through Time**. Gonna be a fun week!

Gonna be looking forward too your comments about Paprika... It's not all that easy making good sense out of it.

Hey man, I really appreciate that! I actually found this new sub for discussion of movies /r/watchamovienow and I have one of the only posts on there (last time I checked). I'm going to be watching one a night, starting monday ending sunday, and I'm going to be posting threads on that sub for each movie. So if you're interested, check it out! 

EDIT: Since it seems a little busier than it was at first, [here's a link to my post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/watchamovienow/comments/28puaq/im_going_to_try_to_watch_an_anime_movie_per_night/) I'll probably be updating this thread with discussion threads throughout the week :)

I watched:

* [Trigun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun) **7/26 eps**
* [Tekkon Kinkreet](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2154/Tekkon_Kinkreet)
* [Sword of the Stranger](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=2418)

I really was surprised and flashed by **Tekkon Kinkreet**. It was such a great experience. If you havent watched it by now, Id really recommend it to you.

**[Guyver (2005)](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=1374)** - Typical henshin hero anime,  but with enough darker twists and actual character development that it stands out among them. Unfortunately it fails to fully distinguish itself and falls into a lot of cliches. The one that made me give it a 6 was the "girl who exists just to object to everything and be emotional." 

**[Kimera](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=2592)** - I grabbed this thinking the shounen ai tag on anidb was more of a minor element, but was (pleasantly?) surprised that it was actually one of the few shounen ai anime I've seen with a real plot and adult characters. Others making this same mistake is probably what caused the extremely low rating on MAL, because other than being a rushed adaptation into an hour long OVA, it's not *that" bad. Even then, the rushed exposition and ending can be accepted if you think of the story in a more small scale, humanistic way - not everything can be explained, not everything will make sense, and not everything will end up how you want it to. I felt that the ending was unique enough to give it a 6, and I wish there was a better adaptation. Androgynous space vampires should be the new Twilight.

**[Youjuu Toshi](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=1107)** - Better known as Wicked City, this lovely 80s gorefest is unique in that it could actually be played straight and adapted to a live action film. There's a lot of sex and weird horrible shit, but the plot (man meets woman, man must save woman and so save the world) is pretty standard and almost wholesome. Well, if you ignore all the rape... and tentacles... and vagina teeth.

**[Photon](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=1944)** - In search of more distilled 90s to consume along with Tenchi Muyo, I picked up Photon. It's a short, very silly sci-fi/harem/comedy that is just what you need if you're feeling down. Like Tenchi Muyo, there's a rich world full of weird technology powered by weird things, several girls orbiting the protagonist, and at least one trip to the bath. The main difference here is that unlike Tenchi, Photon is mentally something like 5, and physically not much older. He rarely speaks, is incredibly strong, and really just wants to protect the girls around him, and eat. I feel like this is a much better alternative to a generic harem protagonist, since he has some personality but still manages to be unobtrusive in the story and still allows it to be largely about the girls. I gave it a 7 for making me laugh.

I stopped watching non-airing shows for a while, so I haven't posted in these threads in the past month or so, but this time I have a lot to talk about, so I hope at least someone will be interested in what I have to say. To avoid spoilers, I will be pretty vague in my descriptions, so if you, the reader, want me to elaborate on something, just ask.

**Tasogare Otome x Amnesia (Dusk Maiden of Amnesia) (11/12)** - I am so torn when it comes to this show. It's a romantic comedy/drama, but it has a twist as well as the wonderful visual style characteristic of its director, Shin Oonuma. In addition, the aforementioned twist is used in a way that I hadn't seen before, and in the first few episodes, the twist was thematically very important to the show. Because of all of these reasons, I loved it during the first few episodes.

After that, the execution unfortunately began to unravel. The show tended more and more towards melodrama intertwined with regular anime comedy, and the plot started going in circles(or more specifically, cycles). This might have been meant as some sort of "mindfuck", but I personally didn't care for it. When I got to the end of the 11th episode, which was surprisingly interesting thematically, I decided to just stop and leave it at that, since the episode had a decent conclusion. I will probably watch the 12th and final episode at some point, but at the time I left it for the future because I had more interesting stuff to watch.

**Ga-Rei Zero (12/12 finished)** - Now this is a good show! This show is probably most famous for its first episode(for reasons that I will not explain due to spoilers), but I liked it in its entirety. It has action(which is very well animated at times), romance(though it should be noted that platonic love is a strong theme), comedy(not too much, just enough to provide a breather after some of the heavier stuff) and drama. It's not a lighthearted show, which made me very happy. Due to the structure of the storytelling, the story has a sense of urgency that I found enjoyable, but it could also be a dealbreaker for people who like their stories told in a certain way. Also, the OP of the show, which is first heard in the 3rd episode(for a good reason, so don't watch it before watching the show if you want maximum mystery), is kick-ass. It's also not terribly difficult to sing along to.

In my opinion, the shows biggest weakness is that it's an anime-original prequel to a manga. It forces the ending to be fairly unsatisfying and non-conclusive, and if one has read the manga, it also puts constraints on what exactly can happen in the anime(luckily, I hadn't read the manga, so I had no idea what would happen). However, I also think that the fact that it's a prequel is the show's greatest strength, for many of the same reasons that I mentioned above. The things that force the aforementioned constraints are stuff like the characters and the setting already existing, meaning that the writers of the show had time to work on more intricate details such as character interaction and action scenes, both of which I thought were excellent. In addition, while the ending wasn't the most satisfying or conclusive, it was also not terrible, which I guess is a plus. Well, not that I was concerned about bad direction at any point, since the show is directed by Ei Aoki(of Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai 1 fame).

**Hourou Musuko (Wandering Son) (8/11)** - Speaking of Ei Aoki, here's a show he directed that could not be further from Ga-Rei Zero, Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai in terms of its story or genres. This show caught my attention when I read its synopsis and saw that it seemed to be tackling gender identity in a non-humorous and extremely direct way, which is certainly very unusual in anime. At first I didn't even notice that it was directed by Ei Aoki, and why should I? The possibility never even crossed my mind before I saw his name in the credits. As I said, this is not like the other shows directed by him. This is a story about middle-school children who wonder about who they really are, what they really want and how they should communicate with other people. And in some ways, it's darker than Fate/Zero, Ga-Rei Zero and Kara no Kyoukai 1 put together. The themes surrounding gender identity come so close to stories I've heard from real people as well as my own experiences that at times the show feels frightening and dominating. It's like it's assaulting my self-perception and it makes me anxious. I am actually slightly afraid of continuing it for fear that something will happen in the show that I can't process either rationally or emotionally. 

But man, that fear and that dominating effect, they feel absolutely great to experience. This show feels great to watch, because it's unlike anything I've seen before in terms of how directly it addresses its core themes. This show uses very few metaphors, if any. When a girl says that she doesn't want to wear a bra, that's because she truly doesn't want to. When a boy says that he wants to wear a dress, that's because he really does want to wear a dress. And that brings me to the greatest thing about this show, and the reason that I'm still entertaining the possibility that I fell and hit my head 4 days ago and that this show is just a figment of my imagination:

I think the characters are perfect. No, not in the "MC-kun can do everything and he gets all the girls" kind of way, I mean in terms of writing. First of all, every character serves a purpose, but it doesn't feel like they were created from the ground up to fill very specific roles. Instead, it feels like the original author wrote a bunch of middle-school kids, made them part of the same group of friends and let the characters fill the different roles in the group dynamic naturally. And indeed, some of the characters feel very natural all around. They have their unique characters, but they all feel the full range of emotions felt by humans. In addition, the characters in this show are just as direct as the show's themes. They are very honest with both themselves(to a certain extent) and others, and most characters rarely hesitate to say what's on their minds. But, to counteract this almost unnatural openness, most of the characters are also capable of lying. Basically, none of the characters are extreme(except maybe for one). For all of these reasons, I find the characters in this show to be perfect in the sense that I don't know how they could be improved. They're wise and mature in exactly the ways that I like my characters to be, and I absolutely love it.

...Except for one thing. The characters being wise and mature is awesome, right? Yes, but they're pretty much 12 years old, an age at which very few children are wise and mature. My greatest criticism of this show is that I feel like the characters are not immature enough. They shouldn't be so quick to forgive. They shouldn't be direct and unhesitant all the time. They shouldn't be so understanding of each other. And this is causing me a terrible headache, because I never thought I would encounter characters like this: They're so perfect and I love them all and this show so much, but for the same reasons, the character writing is flawed. 

Well, not that it matters to me too much, I still think this is the best anime I've ever seen, at least for the moment.

**Now and Then, Here and There (1/13)** - I have only seen 1 episode of this, so I can't say much about it, but so far I like it. It's a breath of fresh air compared to the kind of show I usually watch.

>At first I didn't even notice that it was directed by Ei Aoki, and why should I? The possibility never even crossed my mind before I saw his name in the credits. As I said, this is not like the other shows directed by him.

Yeah, I had the same WTF moment when I checked the staff list. At least, given how good this is, I don't feel so cautious about *Aldnoah.Zero* sucking. Of course, that's an original series and this is based on an award-winning manga, so....
>> ARTICLE
>I don't feel so cautious about Aldnoah.Zero sucking

Yeah, I have a feeling that the quality of Aldnoah.Zero won't be impeded by the style of direction. If anything, it's up to the writers(Urobuchi, don't screw this up) to write interesting characters who can actually be utilised fully.

Also, I noticed an interesting coincidence: This will be at least the third show directed by Ei Aoki where the title of the show has "zero" in the title(The other two being the ones I mentioned earlier in my post).

**Magi 50/50**. It took me about 3 months to get through it all (work/studies got in the way) but mostly lost interest and would come back to it, thinking it would get better. For me it kept 'dipping' into less interesting spots then would come back again, only to repeat.

**Highschool DxD**  - 24/24

Surprisingly good. Was expecting it to be entirely ecchi, but there was actually some sort of plot going on. Currently impatiently waiting for season 3.

The plot is great and I feel like it makes a good parody of shounen anime. Winning by the power of friendship? Hah. Try winning by the power of boobs.

Marathoned through all of Mirai Nikki in a couple of days and absolutely loved it (always enjoyed that type of "survival game"). Yuki kinda annoyed me at times, but overall he was an understandable character. Yuno and Minene (9th) are currently 2 of my favourite anime characters. Just about every character was interesting to me, and the plot twists near the end got me. I was sad after the last ep, but after watching the OVA I feel happy and satisfied about the ending. The OST was also amazing. Would definitely recommend it.

Just finished **Neon Genesis Evangelion.** Liked it a lot. But not a fan of the ending. Kinda confusing and felt really rushed. Anyways i'm now supposed to watch the movies right? Should i just watch them all or..?
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Eva too, and immediately watched EoE. It is very easily my favorite anime now. I loooooved the ending. In both the show and the movie. Though, I am more partial to the idea that EoE is not different than the series ending, just told from a different perspective. Definitely watch it. It clears some things up, but leaves you with some questions too. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Eva, but the general opinion is that you should watch The End of Evangelion now that you've finished the series. It replaces the last two episodes of the series and gives it a different ending if I understand correctly.

The Rebuild movies (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) are a sort of alternate retelling of the series and you can watch them at your leisure after EoE.

**Monogatari: Second Season** (ep 1-18)

Overall pretty decent so far but not on par with Bake yet.  
Tsubasa Tiger Arc was okay but nothing special.  
Mayoi Jiangshi Arc had a cool end and was a bit better than the one before.  
Nadeko Medusa Arc was when it started getting a lot better again.  
Watching forward to see the end of this because it has some interesting setups.

I watched [Midori: Shoujo Tsubaki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2981/Midori:_Shoujo_Tsubaki) and I really don't know what to think of it. It certainly wasn't the best film I've ever seen but it's definitely one of the more unique. I know that doesn't say much but I have no idea what else to say.

I also started watching [Macross Frontier](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3572/Macross_Frontier) and I'm not liking it very much. I've reached episode 20 and there isn't any character that I particularly care for and most of the characters' actions and interactions get on my nerves for some reason. The action isn't any better either but I've yet to watch the ending so I'll see how that plays out.
>> ARTICLE
**OreImo (31/31)**

I'm not sure why I decided to pick this one up but I marathon'd the whole thing this week.  I think the show gets a lot more hate than it deserves because it deals with something that's pretty taboo as well as the fact that some of the characters sacrifice likability for realism (mostly Kirino).  I really enjoyed the show, it was funny, it has an absurd premise (Brother and Sister bonding over Siscon Eroge lol wat), lots of great characters and top notch visuals.  That being said, it has one of the worst endings of any show I've seen, I though people were just being dramatic but it honestly is a big slap in the face.

**Inferno Cop (13/13)**

It turns out that Trigger actually saved anime before Kill la Kill.  I was intrigued by the amount of praise Inferno Cop gets on MAL so I decided to check it out and it did not disappoint.  For a show which only runs about 25-30 minutes total, I laughed harder and had much more fun than pretty much any other show.  Its a shame that we can't rate it Inferno Cop/10 on MAL so we have to settle for 10/10.  If you haven't seen this show do yourself a favor and watch it right now, its well worth the 30-ish minutes of your time.

**Bakemonotagari (6/15)**

I honestly don't know what to think of this show, I really like the visuals and music but the show feels extremely dense with the amount of dialog in each episode.  Put this together with some pretty complex language, random cuts to kanji and other words on various colored backgrounds and the show quickly becomes very hard to understand what is going on.  That being said I'm still enjoying the hell out of it, the dialog is really good, I absolutely love the visuals, and the story is pretty intriguing so far.  I think I'm going to have to watch this one a few more times to figure out whats going on because there is certainly a lot going on that isn't very obvious at first glance.
>> ARTICLE
I agree on Bake. It can be very painful to watch just by the sheer mass of informations. I personally can't watch more than 2 or 3 episodes at once until I need a break to gather what happened and what was talked about. That said I still enjoyed it very very much and liked it for what it is. If you enjoy it by now, you are going to like the rest of it too!

* Yu Yu Hakuso 59/112

I watched all of **Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei** this week, what a fucking trip. That show has all the head tilts and text cut away's you would expect from a SHAFT production, but with a lot more creative liberties taken than in any of their other shows. Half the show is self referential humor, the other half is social commentary on modern japanese society being done by sociopathilogical high school students. All in all, the show has kept me in stitches since pretty much the first episode of the first season, and the third season so far is more of the same. Glad I stumbled upon this one when I did.

E7: Pretty impressive characters, story and universe. It started off slow but I really enjoyed the various events in Gekko-go. However it did get a little dull in the middle, nothing else to complain apart from that.

HxH: I really enjoyed this one, they didn't drag things too much, it's fun to see Gon and Killua interact and of course the action (DAT hisoka vs gon scene in ep35) but I was kind of disappointed to see the pacing in the chimera ant arc, it ended up like most other shounen action on those grounds otherwise that arc was pretty awesome too.

I'm split on the movie. It does great things with the characters, but the underlying storyline isn't nearly as well constructed as the series was. I enjoyed it, but more as a side-element to the series. I think the OVA ending was the best way for the series to finish.

I started watching **Bakemonogatari** this week as it's one of the big shows I have yet try. I'm only two episode in and so far it seems to be, well different is a good word. Not to say that it's bad, but the fan service is extremely overwhelming (panty shot in the first 10 seconds, really?), and the visuals are the Shaft usual. The dialog definitely is entertaining, and I'm excited to see the exchanges been different characters and Arararagi in the future. So I guess you could say my opinion is reserved but optimistic. 

I'm also 1 episode into **Jormungand: Perfect Order** and my big problem with the first season was the lack of any overarching plot and it seems like this time there may be one. Same old same old for everything else, awesome action and Koko is still loko. 


>> ARTICLE
Just FYI, the pantyshot in the first 10 seconds of Bakemonogatari is there for a very good reason. Japanese fans of the light novels (which is most of the viewerbase in Japan, I'm sure) would recognize the scene as being an important moment from Kizumonogatari, so it's a really good and relevant hook.

Unfortunately, if you're a North American/European viewer who has never read the novels, it's just a gratuitous pantyshot for no reason.
>> ARTICLE
**Little Princess Sara 9-28:** It looks like I was right on the mark about the foreshadowing. With the sudden change in the tone of the show, I've been blown away by the quality of it. I'm just so surprised that I haven't heard anybody ever mention it outside of talking about WMT anime in general.

The core strength of the show lies in the characters. Well, mainly Sara. *Ace wo Nerae*'s Hiromi either just took bullying and felt somehow responsible for it, or she was ignoring the existence of it entirely. Sara has a lot of internal conflict regarding it, but outwardly takes all punishment she recieves. There's a moment earlier in the series where she imagines herself hitting Lavinia, then forgiving her. Hiromi didn't do any of that. 

The OST works well enough that I barely know it's there. Except for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeP9n1_JLRk), which usually plays near the end of sad episodes. It gets my every time, even though I know it's coming.

One thing I find strange is that even though the series is centred around the suffering that Sara (and to a lesser extent, Becky) have to put up with, almost all the characters are fundamentally good. Good people, I mean. Not just those that were enchanted by Sara when she was rich, but random people on the street, too. All the people in the market, all the girls in the school (Lavinia aside). I suppose they're all like that just to show how despicable Miss Minchin and Lavinia are. 


**Ie Naki Ko 3-6:** The past few episodes haven't been as tragic as the first, and I lost a little interest. I can certainly see things going wrong again in future, but I feel that otherwise it'll be a fairly standard coming of age story.

**Jewelpet Happiness 1-5:** [A](http://i.imgur.com/MtG6xgs.jpg) [proud](http://i.imgur.com/NoC1cdr.jpg) [member](http://i.imgur.com/JDBYk90.jpg) [of](http://i.imgur.com/Uq8ldX8.jpg) [the](http://i.imgur.com/BFARpYX.jpg) [silly](http://i.imgur.com/50ZOXb1.jpg) [faces](http://i.imgur.com/gpQPiGp.jpg) [genre](http://i.imgur.com/Scwwcyu.jpg). Of course, this was pioneered by *Highschool Kimengumi*, which coincidentally was also animated by Studio Comet. The director has some pedigree too, having directed Cromartie Highschool.

It's a lot funnier than *Lady* already, because it's 90% pets. And when the pets aren't onscreen, there's a main character almost out of *Milky Holmes*. The only thing I can see lacking at the moment is the lack of a tsukkomi, but maybe it'll work.

[Merchandise](http://i.imgur.com/YzY5IbM.jpg) was sold in the first scene of the show, which explained just how happy it would make everybody. I'm quite alright with self-aware advertising like this.

The second to fith episodes haven't been as funny as the first, but Angela and Garnet have gotten more screentime. It's nice to hear Hirano Aya being a main character again.

I've been rewatching a bit of **Blassreiter**. Fairly mature series, early Urobuchi (although he was not the lead writer). It's not truly awe-inspiring by any means, but the writers do a damn good job making you hurt emotionally along with the characters. You also get a very unique sci-fi concept and absurd amounts of movement in the action scenes. Beginning is a little slow, but about halfway through, things kick up a notch.

I made my roommate watch hxh, and in exchange he made me watch the Monogatari series. But he got bored while rewatching it with me, so I ended up just watching Monogatari recaps (in the order: 11, 16, 6) and then watching the first 3 arcs of the show (ie up til episode 15). 
I'd say it's pretty good, but I have yet to see what's so hyped up about it. Maybe not watching all the buildup might have sacrificed some of the awesomeness. Solid 8/10 so far.

**Gundam Unicorn** - Definitely one of my favorite Gundam series now. Not as good as 08th MS Team, but it felt like a proper continuation of the UC timeline.

I legitimately got creeped out at times and the story was great, the cliffhangers were awesome and the twists were excellent! Also i started angel beats, Angel academy (I think that's the name), Trigun, and Madoka Magica.

The past weeks I haven't watched anything not airing because I've been busy with work and games but this week I got around too it.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai** 12/12

Damn it's a shame I couldn't get around too finish this earlier because it was TERRIFIC! I love the mix of comedy and seriousness they accomplish with the series and they make the romance between Yuuta and Rikka seem so natural.

I loved this season but from all I've heard I'll atleast for now stay away from season 2.

**Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin** 26/26

Rainbow has a kickass OP and a great MAL score so I figured I'd give it a shot and after the first episode I was really hyped up about it and it seemed great but overall I'd say it was.... good but not great.

It's definitely worth watching at some point and it was a pretty good series with deep meaning and some real feels (even if you might find that hard too believe in the beginning). All of the main cast were great and the villains while being good characters were the kind of villains I hate XD.

I had a fun ride watching it and I do recommend that people watch it but it's not a 10/10 worthy anime.

**Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya** 2/10

With it's second season coming up in the summer I felt like I needed too check this out as a deciding factor on whether or not I should watch S2 and thus far I think Ilya is really cute and is one of those characters that makes you say "I wish she were my daughter" but aside from that the series haven't been anything special yet.

Planning on finishing Fate/kaleid and Hataraku Maou-sama for next week.
>> ARTICLE
You can watch Chuuni Season 2, but just be aware that's it's basically a silly chuuni comedy and character service show, not the solidly-told and powerful story of the first season.

Prisma Illya is a personal favorite of mine. It's simple and straightforward but very well executed in my opinion. I might rewatch it before season 2 starts airing. I hope you enjoy it!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the comments, I hope I'll enjoy Illya and I might get too watching Chuuni at some point but it's not very highly prioritized right now.

Finished TTGL and all I say is it was amazing and very enjoyable despite the fact I'm not a big fan of mecha anime.

Finished Free! in anticipation for summer continuation. I really liked it. Really beautiful animation, and decent plot.

Caught up with sword art online since there's a new season.  I also finished attack on titan which I was only halfway through.  I'm almost done with devil is a part timer as well --- it's been a busy week.

I finally finished GJ-Bu (6/10) after having it on my NAS for a few months. I also watched the most recent iteration of Yozakura Quartet (7/10).

**Shinsekai Yori** - (25/25)

It might be one of my new favorite shows, but I'll have to think about the story a bit to see if it should be. It's really hard to talk about without spoiling it. 

I still have a couple of questions after watching this show, so if someone could answer these for me, I would be very grateful. 

[spoilers](/s "If Tomiko was 267 when Satoru was 14, and Satoru is her grandson, when did she have kids?" )

[spoilers](/s "What happened to all the other queerats during the last few episodes? I know they were ordered to kill any and all queerats, but the only human-friendly one who showed up was Kiroumaru. Did the Giant Hornet and other human-friendly ones just not come to help or were they slaughtered when they tried to? ")

[spoilers](/s "I know Shisei was killed by subconscious Cantus leakage, but how? Was this just intentionally not explained? ")
>> ARTICLE
Finished Guilty Crown and Strike Witches 1/2. 

For me, Guilty Crown would be somewhere around 7.5-8/10 as although the visuals were amazing, I couldnt stand Shu. 

For Strike Witches, I would give it a 8/10. Hartmann and Lucchini best girl. :P 
>> ARTICLE
id give guilty crown 10 for sound, 9 for visuals but only like a 4-5 for story. I kinda enjoyed it, but damn the concept was so good, they could've done so much more >_>
>> ARTICLE
**Cowboy Bebop**

Holy crap I loved this show. The filler, the characters, the plot...

The one thing I found really interesting was how each of the characters dealt with their past. [Cowboy Bebop](/s "Spike tries his best to ignore it and shut off his current life from his past. Faye is the opposite of Spike. She wants to connect to her past, but she can't no matter what. Jet has a more healthy relationship with his past, using it as an asset sometimes and dealing with problems from the past in a healthy way. Ed's past is just as mysterious to her as it is to the rest of us. The one moment it shows up in the form of her father, it disappears again without a glance back. At the end of that episode, she goes off to chase it, not sure whether or not if she'll ever reach it.")

I also loved Spike and Faye's relationship. [Cowboy Bebop](/s "It's wordless, they don't acknowledge that they're even friends, and yet, it's so much more. One episode, Spike asks her if she'll come save him if he recklessly charges into mortal danger, and that same episode, she does exactly that. It all makes the last scene more moving - Faye telling Spike that the past may not be important anymore, that nothing good came out of her regaining her memories, Spike telling her he needs to see whether or not he's alive, Faye's psuedo-gun-salute...")

I'll definitely be getting and watching the movie. Really wish we could have known a bit of the afterstory.
>> ARTICLE
Nearing the End of **[Saki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5671/Saki)** (23/25). The Individuals were nice, and a new contender that's both good and is an interesting opposite to Hisa in personality ([](/s "Hisa didn't participate in past Individuals because she valued playing as a team, while Nanpo likes playing as an individual so she isn't bogged down by weak team members"))

Also, rewatching Squid Girl (5/12). Because why not? And Mini-ika sequence as adorable as always.

I started watching fairy tail, so far so good, the dubbed is actually decent, I decided to watched all the dubbed and watch the last 30 episodes in subbed, on episode 63. This anime's ability to go from dead serious to natsu's hilarious antics is fantastic.

I'm currently watching **Non Non Biyori**, which is great even though nothing really happens so far, just fantastic characters; and **Eureka Seven**, which I love the characters, the plot, and the mecha.

I also watched the movie **My Life is a Sea of Stars**, the prelude to **Legend of the Galactic Heroes**. It was really, really good! I highly recommend scifi fans take an hour to watch it, even if they don't want to invest in the huge series afterwards.

/r/trueanime is leaking. /s

I've been watching **Watamote**, currently at episode 7 out of 12. The premise of this show is that the main character is a socially awkward high school girl, and she goes through various cringe-worthy moments each episode. Although I was never that cringe-y when I was younger, I still found her character very easy for me to relate to which is why I enjoy the show so much.
>> ARTICLE
[Ping Pong](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_The_Animation) **(11/11)**  
  
I didn't watch this while it aired, to be honest the animation style was the reason. Funimation ended up uploading it to youtube and I was kinda bored so I gave it a shot, and wow, it was actually really good. Yes, the animation style was weird, but it made up for it by being a really fun anime to watch. I ended up watching the last 8 episodes in one day, I just had to know what happened next, pretty good for an anime that is exclusively about Ping Pong.

I finished **Kimi no Todoke** early this week, since then I've been catching up with all my currently-airing shows.  
I thought **Kimi no Todoke** was great, sweet with lovable characters, art, and music.  A good romance without boobs jokes or anything pervy seems rare unfortuneatly.  It could get frustrating at times watching the characters miscommunicate and such.  It also got the comedy side of things down.

The main character is Kuronuma "Sadako" Sawako and is one of the genuinely sweetest girls you will ever see in anime.  Thing is, she's kind of awkward.  She can't force a smile so whenever she tries she ends up scaring people and the way she tries to force herself to talk to people just enforces that.  But things start changing when the most popular guy in class (typing that feels stupid but I don't know how else to describe it) talks to her and starts helping her.  The show is about how she perceives others' feelings while trying to get them to understand her own.  It's about a loner finding out what it's like having friends.  It's about love - both lost and found.  It's also about realizing you can't expect others to do everything - you have to make the effort.

I'd say if it sounds intriguing it's worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. That's exactly why Kimi ni Todoke is my best-of choice for all romance anime and why Kuronuma Sawako is my choice for best-girl-of-all-best-girls.

Watched the last episodes of Higurashi, and I must say I am utterly dissapointed with it, I'm not even conflicted, and I won't say it was bad either, there was just some parts I outright disliked, not to mention I was a bit hyped about it.

[**Hyouka \(2-22/22\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka)

[**Hyouka OVA \(11.5\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13469/Hyouka:_Motsubeki_Mono_wa)

This one will go over your head if you're not paying attention. Even then, it might still go over your head. Really I need someone to explain the wordplay, especially for the [Spoilers](/s "Kanya festival arc, I felt that so much got lost in translation") Definitely tons of details, and its one of the most intelligent anime I've watched so far. My only qualm is that the MAL synopsis is misleading, as the anime is actually episodic at its core. The characters are great, and I find Satoshi to be one of the more effective character foils I've seen, and Oreki obviously is in a league of his own, despite his claim to be "normal". Chitanda is the catalyst for practically every event, and Mayaka also has her moments. Soundtrack is really solid, and I can't find anything bad about this anime.

Rank 22 (10/10)

[**K-On! \(1/13\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On!)

So far so good, plot is pretty much what I expected, characters are better than I thought they would be. Solid ED too, I like it. Doesn't look like there'll be any surprises, I was promised moe and I got moe.

Up next:

1. ~~Waifu Wars~~ Nisekoi

**Black Lagoon 5-12/12**

I watched the first season then decided I didn't want to watch the second season right away. It's an all right show. There's a ton of action... mostly just for the sake of action. That's fine and all but I really wish there was some bigger overarching plot. The show seems mostly about the crew taking on jobs. We never really get to see the results of the jobs they take on so it can feel pointless. 7/10

**Pokemon Origins 1-4/4**

Hnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggg... I just about died from nostalgia overdose. Oh man, just about everything in this short series held true to the game. They even had HP bars in the gym battles! I need more. Lots more. Give me 50 episodes of this. There's so much more there that deserves to be animated that the show only covered through a slideshow. 8/10 because of that.

**Legend of the Galactic Heroes: My Conquest is the Sea of Stars**

I'd always been hesitant about jumping into LOGH because of the length but I finally convinced myself to watch the prequel movie. And oh man was it amazing. This movie really got me hyped up to watch the main series, mainly because of its second half. I found myself completely engrossed and wondering why I had put it off for so long. If you've been considering jumping into LOGH try out this movie and it might be enough to pull you in. 9/10

**Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Overture to a New War**

This movie replaces the first 2 episodes of the main OVA by going into more detail. It wasn't as good as the previous movie but it still got me really interested in the characters. It's amazing how well it built up and made me care about new characters in only a short time. The second half was once again stronger since it focused on a battle and the direct confrontation of Yang vs Reinhard. 8/10

**Legend of the Galactic Heroes 3-7/110**

I skipped the first 2 episodes because of the movie. First off, the art looks completely fine. Sure, it's dated by today's standards, but it overall fits the show. I'm actually a huge fan of the general older art style anyway. It's less polished and more realistic as a consequence. Anyway, some things went down in these episodes. We learned a little about Reinhard's backstory and his relationship with Kircheis. I'm not sure why, but every time Kircheis shows up I want to punch him. He just bothers me for some reason.

I'm really looking forward to where this series is going. Even after 7 episodes it's great and it's only supposed to get better.

Funny coincidence i watched the exact same episodes today and this pretty much sums it up. The lack of an overarching plot kept me away from wanting to watch the second season as of now. While i didnt really dislike it in the beginning, sadly there was no real development. Almost every episode had its own tiny setting, which made the show feel like samurai champloo, but without a goal and results. Gave it a 6/10.

**Death Note**: those lst 3 episodes made up for the okay episode for it man wish that that wasnt the ending.

**Baccano + specials**: Still have no clue what went on during the story but it was really fun and exciting to watch. the tale of the flying pussyfoot was really awesome. the characters are really awesome (^theyre ^all ^getting ^voted ^out ^in ^best ^guy ^contest ^wtf). Probably will rewatch it since it seems like on of those series that is worth rewatching. I just couldnt hate any of the characters as most were really well developed.

**Monogatari series second season**: still really good. I  go through the second story and really enjoyed the time travel part of it. also liked how Araragi tried to summarize Bakemonogatari in one episode.

**GTO the Animation** : This anime is such a gem the op is really awesome and Onizuka is badass as hell of a teacher really love the face expressions. But i would have been fine with GDO as well.

**I can't understand what my husband is saying**: literally the title. Was fun 35 min anime which had  some references to other anime which made me really laugh. Was a fun short comedy overall. 


>> ARTICLE
Baccano is one of my favorite shows. I am also upset that some of my favorite characters have been voted out (especially Isaac and Firo). I would watch it again, I've watched it like 3 times. By the end of the first watch I was still sorta fuzzy, but watching it that second time really helped. The third time was because I just really liked it :)
>> ARTICLE
Watch Baccano again. I didn't really get what was going on the first time and it's something I hear often. I watched it immediately again and the knowledge I had about it from the first watch made it immensely better

The best guy contest is basically a popularity contest, people still vote even if they haven't seen the shows they vote against. Baccano had some great characters, especially Miria and Isaac were my favourites. Vino was pretty interesting too.

###[Texhnolyze](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26) (12-22/22)

*Recommended by:* brother

Part one impressions [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2vzu29/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/combo2l).

*Management*: Im a bit behind on some assignments so apologies in advance. This is going to be a stream-of-consciousness kind of thing touching on different facets of the show that I found interesting or at least what I wanted to discuss.

Im going to continue looking into the statements the show seems to be making on advancement, though I believe [](/s "technology is a means to that end or a case study rather than the bulk of the message itself. A lot of dialog touches on evolution of the species through technolyzation, so I feel thats a better way to frame things.")

Technological ethics of the warring factions:

[Optimism](/s "The Class. The party most willing to make greater and greater sacrifices for the sake of advancement. Kano pushes this to an absurd point that breaks down the entire city of Lux. Hes a demonstration that people do buy into destructive ideas for petty reasons. See: Hal. Hes also a strangely understated antagonist with minimal time on screen and only given to lengthier dialog once or twice.")

[Pessimism](/s "The Union. Flesh purists and dismissive of the approaches taken by the other two parties in achieving the next stage of being. Kimata represents the sacrifice of their ideology having been technolyzed himself. The pitfall of this would be that beliefs of his followers are bound by their acceptance of his sacrifice as valid, and we do see a fissure in his men later on.")

[Deterministic](/s "The Organo. Being a unity of multiple organizations, the Organo value structure and current state of things. It only makes sense that the Organo dissolves when The Class confronts them with Shapes and that Onishi gives in to insanity before his death as what he values is gone by that point.")

Combat: I talked briefly about direction before, but I just wanted to highlight this in particular because it felt so unusual in a welcomed way. Once again, bodies melt into an oversaturation of light. Fights happen fast and someone ends up going down hard. The camera first establishes both the immediate surroundings and the goal of either side such that it grounds the events into the environment. But once bullets fly and punches are thrown, its as if those exchanges are happening in a space completely removed from a few moments ago. 

On nihilism: Doing any reading / research on the show beforehand, you come across that idea. And honestly I didnt really buy into it at first. What I saw were differing factions fighting obstinately over a shared problem whose solutions were derived from the ideology that govern the group, all in the name of [](/s "the prolonging of humanitys survival in Lux"). However, once we first reach [Episode 19](/s "the hill, the war for rule and evolution in Lux is contextualized against the efforts and eventual abandonment of the Theonormal to do the same. They choose to wait a silent death, leaving behind a pastoral paradise and the assertion that man works frivolously towards an unattainable end when seeking perfection through evolution.")

On the tone of the message: Im fine with a show not leaving me with a resoundingly positive message. In recent memory there are shows like Tokyo Ghoul that have a backdrop of cyclical, repeating hatred that lacks a sense of there being future systemic change to remove it. The early episodes of Tex did a lot to filter out viewers who may have had that expectation. And in fairness [](/s "the show concludes with Ichise, the force of animalistic pragmatism, conversing with Rans spirit on how his actions had some effect and later looking almost content when looking down at the lifeless city after giving Rans body to the raffia flowers.")

Geeze, most if not all acts of sex in the show are non-consensual.

So yeah, theres a lot left to internalize. I didnt even touch on things like the Gabe and the Racan or characters like Doc, Sakimura, and Toyama, and I feel as though I need to do a bit of reading and discussing before everything has settled.
	
**Promotional Videos**

ED 2: not linking since its played over the final scene. [](/s "Makes a quiet entrance and exit. Doesnt build too much throughout its duration outside of adding a new layer or two and leaves me with a sort of numb but warm sinking feeling in my stomach.")

My first time posting in this kind of thread, hope I'm doing this right~

**Azumanga Daioh (20/26)**

Not much to say. Hilarious. I really like the teacher's interactions aswell.

**Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate (5/12)**

Pretty generic, but it somehow keeps me itnerested and I hope the twist is not as obvious as it seems.

**Guilty Crown**

I really liked it till like episode 12/13 or something and then it got a bit worse and the end is pretty poor IMO. I still got a lot of enjoyment out of it and the sound and animations were still great.

Would rate it 7,5/10, but just because of how salty I was about the end I gave it a 7.

**Asobi ni Iku yo!**

Cat girl fanservice - the animation? I went into this blind and didn't expect anything. The show turned out to be better than expected, tbh. Characters were rather uninteresting exept for Aoi, sound was okay, animations were pretty solid. All in all I had a fun time watching and [](/s "that true harem end made me cringe")

Gave it 8/10 for *plot*

>> ARTICLE
Interesting. I have different opinion on 2nd half of Guilty Crown. First half for me was drag, while 2nd half picked up a notch in every aspect I think.

>Asobi ni Iku yo!

I laughed so hard at the end. It was fantastic! The show was so dumb (*Beautiful Contact* lol), yet incredibly entertaining.

Agreed on Guilty Crown. Started off pretty well one but fell too far into the stereotype about halfway through. Declined steadily until the trope-y end. just once I'd like to see that kind of show end happily all around without the stoic tragic hero.

I had it on my PTW list for a while and with the second season airing I got the perfect excuse to start it.

**Bakemonogatari** 8-15/15 **COMPLETED**

Visual design is pretty cool. I liked Hanekawa's arc and Kanbaru's arc the most. Will start Nisemonogatari after I clear and complete some shows from my watching list to get it from 35 shows to 20 shows.

**Cowboy Bebop** 10-17/26 

I remember catching a few episodes of Bebop when it was still airing on Adult Swim when I was a wee lad. I really thought it was the best thing ever. Now that I'm older and having more experience in anime, seeing it now, it's still good, but not the best thing ever like I thought it was when I was younger.

The animation looked spectacular at its time (the show's old as me, wow) and the soundtrack is just, wow. Will try to complete it today.

As Attack on Gauna....ahem....Knights of Sidonia season 2 is coming up soon, I decided to rewatch it. It's still among my favourite action anime(when it comes to animation quality in battles, I only preffer F/SN UBW) and my favourite mecha anime. Also spotted some things I oversaw the first time I saw it like [Spoilers](/s "Everyone who looks like the captain actually is the captain...thought they were just clones the first time around. I also realised that at the end of episode 12, the tank in which Gauna Hojishiro was, is empty.")

**OreImo Season 1 & 2**

**Rant Time**

I kept hearing about how bad OreImo's ending was but I didn't want to believe it at first. I tried to convince myself that maybe Reddit was just overacting about their favorite girl or something. I noticed the 3 ending special episodes were ranked in the 6's on MAL which is pretty bad by MAL standards so I was getting even more nervous going into it. I mean I was thoroughly enjoying this series up to this point, there was no way they could mess this up right?? I haven't marathoned a series this hard in awhile, both seasons were great I was having a blast. Then it fucking happens. I have never in my life had a story end with a more convoluted and unsatisfying ending. Everything was wrong with it. I was disappointed in myself thinking that it might actually be ok before going into it. Enjoying a series and having it fall into a crippling coma right at the finish line is heart breaking. 

**Rant Over**

About the series in general I ended up really enjoying it up until the ending. Kyousuke was very similar to Kyon from Haruhi and I loved his inner monologues and how chill he was as a character. The rest of the cast was really fun also.

I went into season 2 liking the harem aspect even more than the first season. In most harems the girls are usually pretty one dimensional and bland but I thought OreImo did a good job creating the characters and giving them enough backstory and motivation to actually like Kyousuke.  I was really rooting for Kuroneko through the series and I'm glad she had alot of impact  while watching the season 2. Hanazawa Kana will always be the Queen of Moe.

Well this was the first anime that after finishing I may actually go read some fan fictions to get a satisfying conclusion. Sigh.

I'd recommend the light novels before doujins, the ending is (supposedly, haven't got that far yet) *much* more satisfactory.

**Finished watching [Clannad: After Story](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad:_After_Story) (23/23)**

I remember back in my high school there were a few guys who used to hang around and smoke in the toilets. I didnt know who they were or why they did what they did, but no one tried to stop them. And I didnt see any violence or anything  physical or verbal  but it seemed like they really wanted to make those toilets their domain. It got to a point where they rendered four of the six cubicles unusable because they started pissing on the floor for some reason. 

I dont know where they are now, but Id imagine theyve entered the workforce. Maybe they fixed up their act and theyre working at some big company. Maybe theyre still working retail. But either way, Im sure theyve realised how silly their youth was, as well as how difficult their transition to adulthood mustve been. They mightve picked up drinking, and their temperament mightve cost them a few jobs here and there but I think theyre still making an effort. 

I say this because this is how I feel about Clannad and Clannad: After Story.  

This is a show that I truly, desperately wanted to like. This might as well be KyoAni at their most naturally deft, because this is a show that combines some of the most pure and honest drama with some breathtaking shot composition and clear mastery of subtlety, and spins it all together to reach some heights in animation that honestly make it hard for me to even try to compare. 
 
It does so many things right, yet it does so many things so very, very *wrong*. Because this is a show that decides to build its skyscrapers on the most charred, desolate ground it could possibly find. When it wasnt doing its magic, it was wasting itself on slice-of-life busywork that treated its female characters like it treated Ushio  like robots filled with mashed potatoes programmed to spew out their mush whenever they were on-screen with actual human beings. Except it didnt matter for Ushio because *she was an actual child*. And thank god Kyou existed  she was the only one of them who could keep up a remotely decent conversation. 

But for everyone else? Absolutely *disgusting*.   

And they werent just limited to being children: they were housewives, they were little sisters, they were destined lovers, and they were helpless figures to be protected. It was like a long, cruel joke on toxic gender roles. And it certainly wasnt very funny. 

Not only does Tomoya have a saviour complex, he has a saviour complex *and they gave him romantic compensation for it*. Its a show thats saying Yeah, this is good. This is how its meant to be.

No, show, Nagisa is *not* a strong person. A pile of talking mush overcoming the great hurdle of talking to other piles of mush is not, in fact, a significant feat. No, she is not just shy  she might as well not even be human  because she lives in a world where the notion that women can stray from their assigned one-note personalities like clumsy or airhead or weak does not exist. And no, combining those three traits together does not make a character any more complex.

But when it peaked, boy did it *peak*. This is a show that had me on the edge of my seat during an arc as pointless and arbitrary as Miyazawas. Even *I* could feel a little something as Tomoya desperately clung to Nagisa when she gave birth. And the stuff with his father and how it tied back to his relationship with his daughter? Yeah, I shed a few tears. Thinking back on all the good bits almost even makes me willing to forgive it for all its faults. I wasnt kidding when I said this is a show that I truly, desperately wanted to like, because this is the stuff of KyoAni legends. This show knows how to emotionally charge a scene so well with all those shots and colors and subtle little movements its ridiculous. *This* is why I gave my undying love to KyoAni, and *this* is why I keep coming back to their stuff, no matter how empty and devoid of substance they may be. 

Even after all I've said about it, I cant say I regret my time spent. Because beneath all the terrible chemistry, the saviour complexes, the infantilized women, the jokes about infantilized women, the tough mans world talk, the pointless asides, the objectification, the traditional housewives, and that ridiculous everyones happy asspull of an ending theres a heart. You cant hear it very well, and sometimes it can seem like it just stops beating completely, but its there.  

And its actually kinda big. 

**Final verdict: I cried and I sighed/10**

** **

**Finished watching [Clannad: After Story  Another World, Kyou Chapter](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6351/Clannad:_After_Story_-_Mou_Hitotsu_no_Sekai_Kyou-hen) (1/1)**

Thats right, this was so good I had to give it its own section. 

Did I mention I like Kyou? Because I, yknow, like Kyou. She wasnt just a textbook tsundere, she was a textbook tsundere who knew how to talk like an actual human being. Even comparing her to the others does her kind of a disservice  she was *way* more than those walking vegetables, because she had *actual chemistry with Tomoya*. Thats already pretty bonkers in anime, honestly, where romantic relationships are defined more by who they are and what they do than by any genuine rapport. 

So after I finished watching this, something occurred to me.

This this is everything Ive ever wanted Clannad to be. 

It delicately combines KyoAnis masterful visual storytelling with the acute personal drama of youth and adolescent relationships. Sure, Clannads poignant reflections on life and family were nice. But this? A love triangle with two female love interests might not have been as ambitious but goddamn I will read 1000 pages of NarutoXSakura fanfiction if you can say it wasnt *at least* as sincere. This OVA did more to me in 20 minutes than what Toradora did in its entire runtime. 

This is why I hate KyoAni, and this is why I love them so very, very much. 

**Final verdict: KyoAni shouldve just replaced the show with a 12 episode spin-off with Kyou as the main heroine/10**

Edit: It was very unexpected but thank you for the gold, kind stranger! 

>> ARTICLE
I watched Clannad and AS last week. I couldn't agree more with your points. When Kyou turned up in afterstory I thought I my ship was coming in. Then there were just 6 episodes of watching puppies being kicked, then an ending that left me confused.
>> ARTICLE
I love kyou as well! The way her emotions towards Tomoya really made me happy. When her and Ryou cried after realizing he liked Nagisa was something else. I was kinda disappointed at how short her episode was because it didn't seem to focus on her enough. Still loved it though.
>> ARTICLE
How did u manage to get yourself to watch Clannad afterstory after giving Clannad a 4/10? In the first place, how did u pull through Clannad? I dropped it after 6 episodes. Tell me your secret please :>. I m always trying to get myself to pick it up again, but i dont know how. Please give me a reason kind stranger :D
>> ARTICLE
I guess I kept watching more as an obligation to its popularity and it being a KyoAni work, but it was definitely a trudge in some places. I'd probably tell you to keep watching if you like KyoAni stuff in general. Otherwise, it *is* a big time sink, and if you're not really into this sort of thing I can't say it'd be worth it. 
>> ARTICLE
Your taste tends to lean towards more action anime, and you didn't like Angel Beats! which is by the same people as Clannad and has a similar feel. 

You aren't going to get it.

Nah, Nagisa is best. Nagisa is always best.

Also, I really enjoyed Clannad, and After Story. I think it deserves #6 on MAL. Opinions will be opinions I guess...

That's exactly how I felt about Clannad. It made me cry, but I wouldn't call it good.

###**NGE Rewatch: End of Evangelion (Rewatch Complete):**

While it's my 3rd or 4th time watching NGE, I think it might be only my 2nd time watching End of Evangelion. I remembered it had some live-action segments, but for some reason I remembered it as if there'd been more, and as if they were longer, and had more untranslated segments. I wonder about that.

This film though. While rewatching NGE, it's still clear to me it's a masterpiece, trying to wrap my head about what I think and feel of End of Evangelion is much harder. Is it a continuation of the psychological turn of events and exploration that NGE is? Sometimes. Is it a film with a focus on the spectacle, on the viewing *experience*, in segments such as [spoilers](/s "Asuka's fight with the Eva Series, and with Rei towering above all?") Sometimes, it definitely is.

Is it a movie that continues NGE, is it a movie that tries to separate itself from the symbolism, or wallow much deeper into it? Is it a film that has something it tries to say, that tries to make amends, not just for itself, but for characters such as Gendo, trying to show you how similar he and Shinji are? A movie that tries to make it clear that Shinji and Asuka aren't broken, but broken in the same way in case anyone somehow missed it, and that theirs is a sibling relationship, and that family is the most broken thing of all (a message the main series makes consistently)? It's all those things. It's a film that's a spectacle and base, which is artistic and deep. It's a film that's a mess because it's so many things, in so little time. Sometimes it hits you over the head, and sometimes it hits you over the head to make sure you didn't miss things earlier.

It's certainly still an experience, even if it's quite indulgent in a few places with itself. But then again, Hideaki Anno, when it comes to Evangelion, had always been indulgent to a degree. And you can also see some places in EoE where the groundwork for 3.33 were set, both in terms of story, and atmosphere. And yes, indulgence.

###**Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. / My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU / OreGairu - Episodes 1-13 rewatch, OVA watch (Complete):**

I like OreGairu. I don't love it. I gave it 7/10, which is a very respectable score. I just wanted to rewatch it for a while, and sometime this week I really felt the urge, so I did. I had nearly no memory of Yui, which also played a part in it. The standard red-haired "almost childhood friend" character, right.

I still laughed at Totsuka Saika's segments, even if, just as the first time, I sighed at the anime having them. I noticed quite a few segments reminded me of Bakemonogatari in particular, and Shaft (that is, Shinbo) in general, in terms of shot composition, atmosphere, etc. Especially episode 8, directed by [Nakano Hideaki](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=49322), which even had a head-tilt. The show also had quite a few places where it discussed the same issues as NGE, but then again, lonely boy trying to find his place in the world and lashing at those around him? Makes sense. This time I also noticed Aoi Yuuki playing the little sister.

The OVA was forgettable and nothing special. I didn't find anything to make me rage and want to destroy anime fandom. That bit wasn't part of the episode, but the fanbase, who keep pushing for sensei as a love interest, not understanding how it'd cheapen her role and character, and damage the show irreparably.

###**Akame ga Kill episodes 21-24 (Complete):**

As part of my ongoing mission to tie all the loose ends of shows I watched most of but left but a few episodes to the side. It hit me, all of a sudden, how chuuni this show is, in a sense. With Mine saying out loud to her enemy what powers her up, with each side exclaiming to the other how they'll defeat them, how they will not surrender, etc.? It was like someone tried to out-Naruto and out-Bleach those two shows, to out-chuuni them, and sorry, those two shows are already so very chuuni (said with love, I liked both shows).

I truly did not expect episode 24 to [spoilers](/s "not undo what happened in episode 23"), where it felt more like a movie, rather than a series, especially one based on a long manga series. The final bit of the finale, [spoilers](/s "with the emperor being executed didn't have any weight, nor did Tatsumi's death.") I was mostly watching this show because even as the show broke down the moment one tried to take it seriously (and I argued in the past the show only works if you don't take it seriously, at all), I did care at some segments, even if they did not feel entirely earned. But here, as the show ended? It just felt like a series of plot-events, not like a series of events happening to real characters. I watched this show mostly for the light entertainment it provided, and while the last few episodes definitely had some over the top fights, the acting, especially of [spoilers](/s "Akame's crying"), couldn't keep up.

I gave it 6/10, though it's more like 6.5/10 - I enjoyed the show to a degree, but not always as it intended, and it had more warts than a warthog.

###**Hyouka episodes 17-18:**

Rewatched the last episode I watched before trying to catch up on 2014 during December, or the onslaught of new shows during January, or the sudden NGE rewatch, and man, it's really been over 2 months since I've last watched Hyouka? Well, one more arc to go, should be done by next week.

Then watched episode 18 last night, planned to finish the show, but was in the wrong mood (cue Pushing Daisies mood first aid), but it did make me finally realize the second main theme of Hyouka, **it's a show about uncovering how and why people hurt one another. About how they spend time together.** There'll definitely be a post when I finish it.

###**Magical Sisters Yoyo and Nene:**

I wonder why Nene is even in the title. Anyway, I'll keep this short, as I want to go and watch anime. While watching the movie, from the first few minutes, I was reminded of Urusai Yatsura Movie 2: Beautiful Dreamer, even if it's been a long while since I watched it, and as the movie continued, some plot elements actually matched what happened there, ha!

Then the movie reminded me of Digimon, and as it continued, it reminded me more and more of another famous film by the Digimon movie's director, Summer Wars. It looked as if Digimon-Summer Wars had a child with Kyousougiga, and had a bit of help from Dennou Coil and Sekai Seifuku: Bouryaku no Zvezda. Morohoshi Sumire in the lead role sounded so much like Kana Ueda I couldn't believe it weren't her, especially as this is a film produced by Ufotable.

What of the film itself? A fun romp, a delightful explosion of colours, and all sorts of hijinks, and some emotions. An enjoyable 7.5/10 watch. It won't blow your mind, it won't captivate your hearts, but it's very much worth the watch.

**Mobile Suit Gundam (20/43)**

This show really does keep getting better and better. Even though there's a lot of animation issues (not just saying this because it's old, because I really don't mind the look of this show whatsoever, I think it looks fine) the story and characters are keeping me drawn in. Usually the [QUALITY](http://i.imgur.com/7sQnA8Y.jpg) [moments](http://i.imgur.com/dWdhOmr.jpg) are funny enough to just laugh at anyway.

LOVE the mecha designs so much that I've already ordered an RD RX-78-2 from Mandarake, along with a custom Gouf which I don't think appears in MSG, though there definitely is a Gouf, just not one with two miniguns.

Also, [that OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn27jQAuoWw) is soooo much better than it has any right to be. I fucking love it. 'GINGA E MUKATTE,
TOBEYO GANDAMU! KIDOOUUUU SENSHII GANDAMUUUU! GANDAMU!'
>> ARTICLE
The Gouf custom might be from 08th MS team I would guess. There is a famous fight from that show involving one. And yes ~~that Op~~ ~~pretty much every Gundam Op~~80's mecha openings are fantastic. Not quite on the same level of operatic goodness but oh well. 80's theme songs of that type just blow my mind consistently. I could dump all too many fantastic Gundam openings but it just makes me sadder that I haven't seen the shows for them yet T_T.  So have some [non](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIf6HIRhu-U) [Gundam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5i3H-mgoTE) [ones] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPALe1jTRzk) instead.
>> ARTICLE
[90's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pYduET6PwI) [Mecha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX462lGeoXs) [OP's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4brtDQ4E8UY) are pretty damn awesome too. Technically that last one isn't actually 90's but the theme is so damn similar to GGG's first OP that it's not really a big deal anyway, the first OP was taken down off youtube so it's the only alternative. Edit: Turns out it's actually an edit of multiple GGG OP's into one. Just search up GaoGaiGar on soundcloud or something to find the original and stuff.

I like the Aura Battler Dunbine one especially out of those 3.
>> ARTICLE
Yea I've heard GGG's op before. It's pretty great stuff. 

Dunbine is another Tomino anime for reference. I think he made it between MSG and Zeta perhaps. Ideon of course is Tomino as well with the follow up movie Ideon: Be Invoked being a large inspiration to EoE allegedly. Layzner more obscure than the other two as it's a fairly lukewarmly received (from what I can tell) show by Ryosuke Takahashi, the same guy who most famously directed Armor Trooper Votoms as well as Flag, a post eva show called Gasaraki, and Blue Gender. All three are shows that I really need need to watch at some point T_T.
>> ARTICLE
Gouf Custom is 08th MS Team, only the regular Gouf shows up in First Gundam.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, knew it was primarily from 08th MS Team from looking up reviews of the figure, but I wasn't sure if it made any form of cameo in MSG or not. Thanks! Looks like 08th MS Team is next on my list, just so I can justify my purchase more (though I don't think I need any beyond the fact it looks great).

**[Gintama'](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9969/Gintama) (37-42/51)** - Three hilarious two-part stories, including Gin snowboarding on the Shogun and getting his own harem. [More in the weekly thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2wnr87/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_237243/)

**[Shin Sekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) (15-21/25)** - Daily discussion here and in /r/shinsekaiyori. The pace definitely picked up with the most recent arc [episode 17](/s "and a 12-year jump forward.") At this point I'm not seeing a bright future for Saki, still have no idea where it's going and how it will resolve.

---
**[So Ra No Wo To](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To) (11-12/12 + OVA)** - Daily discussion here. [Episodes 11/12](/s "Last week I said I didn't think the story would take a serious turn, and I was completely wrong. Very different tone compared to the rest of the series but a strong ending.") The TV series wraps up nicely but the OVA epilogue throws a wrench into things by improving the series as a whole and it really made me want to see more. While it didn't feature music as much as I wanted, I still quite enjoyed it overall. **9/10**, want a Rio & Kanata sequel.

---
**[Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari) (8-15/15)** - I said last week I liked Kanbaru and that just keeps going here, though Sengoku didn't really draw my attention. For Hanekawa, I was interested in her from the beginning since she was the bookish girl and, on the surface, was the one normal character in the series. [Minor spoilers](/s "Turns out I was completely wrong about that last part, since Araragi had helped her before the series even started.")

One general thing about this series that I really like is that each arc gets a completely different OP focused on that girl. Staple Stable was okay, but I enjoyed the others more. For the series as a whole, It's mostly chatter with lots of cuts, closeups, and strange angles to make it feel like there's more happening than there really is. A decent first series but not even close to being one of my favorites, **7/10** and I'm carrying on to Nisemonogatari next.
>> ARTICLE
**LotGH 45-58**

I did not expect the events of episode 55 to happen so early in the series, but it makes me even more curious as to what will happen later in the show. The whole situation with Earth is really interesting and I can't wait to see what happens when the cogs start moving again. Also Reinhart's reaction to [the](/s "assassination attempt") was ridiculously badass and selfish at the same time. He's one of my favorite protagonists of all time.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked [episode 55](/s "the conversation between Yang and Reinhart when they finally met. 'People should be able to make their own mistakes, or they will never learn', I've always liked that view from Yang. For someone who constantly critisizes democracy, it's nice to see some justification for the side he fights on.")

Finished [Tantei Opera Milky Holmes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7768/Tantei_Opera_Milky_Holmes) not too long ago. I swear, this anime is stupidly fun to watch. Despite having some cute and funny moments, the story isn't what I wanted, but I guess I had those funny moments. Enjoyable overall. Sucks to see that [ending spoiler](/s "their Toys are gone again...")
>> ARTICLE
Milky Holmes is the most terrible thing I've ever watched. I hated every single part of it to death. 11/10 would kokoro again.

If you want to continue with the madness there's a S2 out there, a spinoff/S3 that everyone says is terrible, and a S4 currently airing.

**Non Non Biyori** (12/12)

Absolutely one of my favorite SoL's to date. I went on at length about how much I loved nnb in the WT! this week, but to reiterate, this is a really, really good show, and I'm very excited that it's slated for another cour. 

**Neon Genesis Evangelion, End of Evangelion** (1/1)

Watched this with the re-watch group on this sub - a great way to cap off a great series. 

**Tamako Love Story** (re-watch) (1/1)

Almost as great the second time around. I could watch it again for the animation quality alone. 

continued:

**The iDOLM@STER** (17/25)

I've said before that I really enjoy the characters in this show - add to that the pacing, which has been very tight over the course of the series. Watching the cast rise through the rungs of idol-dom, interspersed with more character-specific episodes, has been a lot of fun. I will say, while they've added some tension vis a vis the competing idol team, the drama in this show is sort of thin, the curse in part I think of having such a light show with a very obvious outcome.

**Mawaru Penguindrum** (11/24)

Watching this with the sub's watch group - it's been really fucking good so far. A recent spell of unemployment has meant I can spend hours pouring over the themes and symbols in each episode, I'm just trying to get this one wrapped up before I go to Japan.

[A Certain Scientific Railgun S (4-6/24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16049/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_S) - Continued trying to watch Railgun S this week, to come to a not-so-good revelation. The internet in the dorm building I'm in is god awful when it comes to using Hulu (which is the main streaming source I've been using for S. Ironic, since it's the only building on campus with apartment-style housing, being the nicest dorms on campus). So, unfortunately, I've put Railgun S on hold and I'm planning to finish it during our first break, which comes in about two weeks.

[Kyoukai no Kanata (1/12)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18153/Kyoukai_no_Kanata) - Started Kyoukai no Kanata on a whim when trying to find something new to watch. It wasn't bad, but didn't really feel like something I wanted to watch right away.

[Love Live! School Idol Project (1-7/13)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15051/Love_Live!_School_Idol_Project) - And, finally, the series I've decided on as my next series to watch. I've never really been big on a lot of the idol shows, and this is actually the first one I've really sit down and watched. So far, I'm liking what I see. Maybe it's because I watched the former first, but I'm drawing a lot of similarities in both some of the characters and some elements of the overarcing plot to K-On (Umi is literally school idol Mio, this is my firm opinion). It's been an enjoyable experience so far, and looking forward to finishing it up in the next day or two. Also, [**Best girl**](#nico-heart)

This week, planning to finish Love Live in the next day or two, and most likely move on to the second season. After that, most likely going to give Sakura Trick a try.

**the irregular at magic high school(Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei)** 26-26 i hope there will be a s2 , [Spoilers](/s "what issue i have with the series is that it didnt show what happend with him when he was a child, because i think that was necessary to understand the brother-complex, im not a fan of incest, but in this situation i think it could have been more understandable if we knew exactly what happened ")

Yeah, S2 would be great. I loved S1. It was really a shame they didn't expand on why Tatsuya is so good at magic and his past overall. And while I'm no big fan if incest myself, for some reason, I was almost rooting for Miyuki. 

And I also found the ending kinda dumb. I was ok with Tatsuya being awesome throughout the show, but the [Mahouka spoilers](/s "god-more he pulled off in the end") looked stupid.

[**Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (Complete Series)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25159/Inou-Battle_wa_Nichijou-kei_no_Naka_de)

I'd been browsing r/anime for a while, until I stumbled across [a certain clip (Spoilers)](http://a.pomf.se/ieeciu.webm), and within a minute Inou-Battle was on my Plan to watch list. I mention this because when going into the show, this is the type of thing I was expecting to happen throughout. However, it seems I was the only person who expected this because after finishing the show and reading other people's opinions, it seemed that everyone else was expecting an action anime.

**Inou-Battle is not an action anime. I don't care if trigger animated it, it's main focus isn't the superpowers the characters obtain and you shouldn't expect it to be**

Because Inou-Battle *was* what I was expecting, I loved it. Seriously, I'm not quite sure what it was about it that made it so good in my eyes, but I was laughing out loud almost every episode, found all of the characters interesting, with fantastic VA performances, and some moments in it were so heartfelt (see above) that I almost teared up.

The only issues I had with it is that towards the end it tries to establish the harem a bit too hard, even when it's made painfully obvious that only one of the girls can win (she gets far more screen time, and narrates the beginning and end), and also the show doesn't conclude, not that I expected it to (It's a harem, THEY ALMOST NEVER END), but it would have been nice.

I can't give Inou-Battle anything less than a **9/10** because without a doubt it is the best harem anime that I have ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
My main problem with Inou-Battle was the *fairies* subplot. It was so stupid and completely unnecessary. *In this single episode we are going to explain the origin of the magical powers! And then we will never speak of it again because it's completely retarded.* And yeah, the harem got a bit out of hand by the end. But it was fun show nevertheless.

**Higurashi no naku koro ni and Higurashi no naku koro ni kai**  
I went into this show thinkig it would be some Final Destination-level slasher horror based on those gorey death scenes that circulate around the internet. What I experienced, however was the most enthralling mystery anime I have ever seen which hardly relies on the shock value of the gorey scenes, those just compliment the masterfully composed atmosphere and the faces...my god those faces...all their budget went into those creepy faces, which leaves the rest of the shows looking "only" decent, though that is only a little drawback. Oh, and the characters behind the faces: I personally loved the characters, I laughed and cried maniacly with them with Shion takig the cake for me (Psychos are entertaining to watch)closely followed by Rena.And if characters, I have to mention the VAs.Once again, Japan shows us that she has the best voice actors, their performance during certain scenes is nothing short but amazing. I already mentioned that the creepiness comes mainly from the atmosphere, well the music makes it like 10 times better! "Main Theme" (that's the offical name) might very well be the best atmospherical music piece to date!  
TL:DR 1st Season: creepy-intriguing-gorey-wtf shit happens 2nd Season: creepy-intriguin-gorey-wtf shit is explained and given context. **WATCH THEM**  
  
**Inferno Cop**  
13 x 2-4 minutes. Watch it. Just watch it. You won't regret it. Though you should probably leave your brain at the front door first.  
  
**Another**  
Maybe it's just because of the influence of Higurashi, but Another didn't feel as compelling of a mystery as Higurashi did. Don't get me wrong, it's good, it's **PRETTTYYYYYY** beautiful and while most of the caracters are bland, Mei is an excellent waifu material!The soundtrack also does wonders here! If you liked Higurashi, I don't think you will hate it, you should give it a shot!

**Nerawareta Gakuen (7/10)**
This movie was a beautiful piece; some of the smoothest, cleanest animation I've ever seen with immaculate backgrounds. Unfortunately, the plot swerves in odd directions, and at some points makes no sense at all. The characters range from heart-wrenching depth to shallow Shakespeare quoting. It was a fine movie but nothing to write home about.

**The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya (10/10; Rewatch)** While it's true that this movie isn't as good the second time around because you know what's coming, it's still a masterpiece and my second-favorite work by KyoAni. The animation quality is strong throughout, despite being three hours long. Kyon's internal monologues are among the best I've ever heard, and some scenes still got my heart pumping the second time around. It's just so damn good.

**Detective Conan, (8/10, Ep70ish~)** Good show

**Hellsing Ultimate**  
Absolutely awesome show, the English VA in it was absolutely glorious, my friends have been bugging me for months to watch it, glad I finally did. All hail the Fuck-Mothering Vampire Alucard.
  
  
**FLCL**  
Friend has been bugging me for months to watch this as well since it is so short, was almost completely lost the entire show, but I read an old thread on the meaning behind it and it made a lot of sense, really great show.  
  
**Angel Beats**  
Literally just finished this, began watching because of the circlejerk surrounding it, and this was a very well deserved circlejerk. Freaking amazing show where I laughed and cried so much, I haven't done that in a long time. This is going down somewhere in my top ten.

**Sword Art Online**  
Finished this at the beginning of this week, I can understand everyone's hate of it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, though I do think the first half of the first season was hands down better, I still enjoyed the Alfheim arc and the ending of the show left me in tears because I am a massive sucker for love stories. Have not watched SAO II yet, will be soon.

**Steins;Gate (22-24/24)**

Finally got around to finishing this show. I really did enjoy it, although I wasn't a big fan of the cliche where [Major Spoilers](/s "Okabe goes back in time to prevent Kurisu's death and ends up being the one that killed her.")

All, in all, I give it an 8/10. I'm the kind of guy that prefers action and comedy, but this show was really interesting, and I had a good time watching it.

**Fairy Tail (126-127/175)**

And now begins my long trek into 25 episodes of filler. I don't mind Fairy Tail filler, since it's usually pretty humorous, but I will likely only be watching an episode every now and then between shows.

**Rewatched Kill la Kill Episode 1, but this time, with English dub**

I was half asleep while this was on in the background, so I don't remember much, but I thought the dub was pretty good. I thought they nailed most of the voices, except for Mako. Wasn't really a fan of her VA.
>> ARTICLE
You got the Grand Magic Games next, then a short filler and then some epic shit goes down. Fairy Tail has become my favorite anime of all time because of it.
>> ARTICLE
Caught the English dub of the third episode last night. I had watched the battle scene before and was turned off by Senketsu's voice actor, but upon rewatch he sounded a whole lot better (so much so that I'm wondering if they didn't do another pass with his lines).

But yeah, pleasantly surprised by the English Dub. Maybe I'll hate Nui less without her painfully cutesy/high pitched voice.

... Who the fuck am I kidding, of course I won't.
>> ARTICLE
That cliche in Steins;Gate was way too obvious since the first episode, and while I loved that they put it in, it felt really uneeded.
>> ARTICLE
Heads up, the grand magic games arc will make it all worth it in Fairy Tail.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've heard good things about that. It'll be a few months though, since I'm watching the dub.

I would just switch to sub, but I'm a big fan of Rooster Teeth, and someone from there is voicing Sting in the dub.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, no need to rush it anyway, because after the Grand Magic Games arc you get another filler.
>> ARTICLE
totally agree with you i think the grand magic games arc was my favorite behind the edolas arc. that filler arc was just so god damn meh it took me forever to finish

**[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](http://myanimelist.net/anime/849/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu) (25-27/28)**  
I'm not sure when I'll watch the movie so I'm sort of hesitant to finish up the series but I'm so close I might as well!

**[Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun) (1-12/12)**  
7/10. Funny, cute, all that good stuff. Just sort of forgettable, I didn't find myself particularly attached to any of the characters. I think I just don't like comedies though, because I can't say this was poorly made or anything, I just didn't care for it so much.

**[The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2236/Toki_wo_Kakeru_Shoujo)** (rewatch)  
7/10. I haven't seen this in a few years and my friend and I were looking for a movie to watch so we settled on this one. Still really enjoyable but I didn't like it as much as I remember, mostly because I didn't understand it. I think last time I settled to just enjoy it without trying to piece everything together, but this time I realized how some stuff just didn't make that much sense. Still though, I'd recommend this one.

**[Into the Forest of Fireflies' Light](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10408/Hotarubi_no_Mori_e)** (rewatch)  
9/10. Just as good as the first time I watched it, a really great movie. It doesn't try to do too much, it just tells a really sweet story. Sufficiently cheesy and tear-inducing, this is one of my favorite movies for sure.

**[The House of Small Cubes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5365/Tsumiki_no_Ie)**  
8/10. Great short film (12 minutes). This is more impactful than a great amount of 90+ minute movies. Absolutely worth checking out.
>> ARTICLE
I just watched Fireflies the other night... Good god, I was not ready...
>> ARTICLE
I agree on the GWLTT, nice movie but some plot details/holes ticked me off too much to fully enjoy it. I don't remember exactly but there's definitely some stuff wrong with it, something with how certain characters shouldn't remember certain things etc. 

Time travel is hard to do well, I think the only story I've ever read where it was consistent was the Time Traveller's wife (and the parallel timeline treatment in DBZ, though there it's kinda weird that people would care about their timeline if they can just go to a different one)

Summer Wars - 87/100 - Completely caught me by surprise, cried more than once, and that rarely happens. I didn't know I could enjoy a "family" movie.

Accel World - 78/100 - Lots of things I didn't like, (romance drama, fan service) but it didn't get in the way enough, I liked that the MC had flaws, and the villain was understandable while still being hateable. 

>> ARTICLE
Hiya! Midterms are next week so I have't been keeping up with the airing anime. But I did make time to watch some ***Moyashimon*** to help me go to sleep at night. Pretty good - a lot of surface elements are similar to *Silver Spoon*, but it's pretty unique in it's own right, what with the MC being able to see microbes as cute little aliens and all. I generally think it's jokes are better, although it's comedic timing is a little off and lingers occasionally - the mold maze joke in episode 6 took entirely too long. 

Conversely, though, the actual pace of the plot is pretty quick. And I think this might be to the show's detriment, in that it doesn't seem to dig deep into it's characters in the same way that *Silver Spoon* would into Hachiken's inner problems. Granted, our MC here isn't nearly as traumatized as Hachi was going into his agricultural school, but still - it's not as character driven as I'd like, and the quick pace doesn't help it. It's not like a fast paced show *can't* be character-driven: *Ping Pong The Animation* was resoundingly the best show of 2014, and had both stellar character writing and a blistering pace.

On a positive note, though -[ this OP is possible the most adorable thing ever omg.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8xrp5_moyashimon-opening_music) So cute. Fuck K-ON, I want a show about adorable little squishy microbes dancing around everywhere.

P.S. I also want Hasegawa [to step](http://th09.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2014/033/6/4/haruka_hasegawa_1_by_electricmastro-d6e6cp3.jpg) [on me.](https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6vdfqTyZB1qde1k3.png)

**[Soul Eater](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3588/Soul_Eater) (8/51)**

It was better than what I expected overall. It has a common story but art style and characters are good enough to keep me interested.

Oh, characters except Black Star. I read him being really annoying before watching, but he exceeded my expectations. I don't remember any character made me annoy from himself this fast.

Edit: A word

I hated Black Star at that point as well. I got used to him as the series went on. 

My most hated character from that show is still Blair though.

Been watching [The World Only God Knows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_God_Only_Knows), this past week. Great animation and comedic moments, intertwined with some drama and of course, romance. I never noticed it before, but the soundtrack is amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
For me it was Episode 1 and 2 of Baccano!

Having recently binged Hunter X Hunter, I was ready for some different style anime. I watched Durarara last week and was pretty impressed, and then people reccomended Baccano!

So far it's been reasonable. The characters are interesting and the setting seems to be solid. The story just started and most of it is setup, but I'm already hooked. Hope to watch the rest of it next week.

* [**Samurai Flamenco**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19365/Samurai_Flamenco) - **Completed** - I completed this over the week with my friend. First time I watched something with him without having seen it myself first. I gotta say that this was a pretty great series. The following is my opinion with spoilers: [Spoilers](/s "I really loved the beginning and ending of the series. A lot of the middle part where it went full on parody was just ridiculously stupid. Honestly, I can understand that it was a really good set up for doing the later drama but I wish it wasn't so damn cringeworthy. I suffered through some of those early middle episodes. Overall though, I really loved the Universe Guy and how Flamenco has no real meaning. It reminds me of another series where the title has no real meaning. :3 The last arc was really well done too and I'm happy they didn't follow the crazy train too much. The way he ended up naked with Goto at the end which was a throwback to episode 1 I think was great.") There was just so much great drama in this series with constant plot developments that tied really well into each other. The way things would escalate was logical and felt satisfying. The series overall was good. I'd definitely recommend people to watch it with the one piece of advice being to hang in there when you start to get frustrated. It's worth it. [Last Thing from the Final Episode](/s "The last thing I'm disappointed in is the lack of resolution for Goto's missing girlfriend.")

>> ARTICLE
Finished **Planetes**. The first third was pretty average, though interesting slice of life, because it's realistic hard sci-fi in a space work environment with decent characters. ^ninja ^episode ^still ^sucked. 

Then the second third got a bit more interesting, focusing on fullfilling dreams and having goals in life. 

The last part everything got fucking real. It dealt very interestingly with increasing globalization and the flaws of capitalism (monopolies and increase of inequality), and then some serious Lord of the Flies vibes near the end. Ending was a bit dissatisfying to me [spoiler](/s "because Tanabe's survival was a bit contrived and the meet-up with the motorcycle crash not well written"), but in the end I enjoyed it and it made me question some serious things about life, which is always good in an anime.

Also watched some **Gintama** episodes but there's not much to say about that. Time skip arc was pretty funny though, I wish it had lasted longer. The deal with Gintama is that the author never seems able to commit to something fully, halfway through each arc it always seems like he gets bored with the idea. Which is nice if you like subversion, but not nice if you want real character development etc.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching Berserk and I am UTTERLY confused with how it ended. It was a very enjoyable show to watch all the way until the end. It turned into complete chaos, and I seriously have no idea what to say. 9/10 I'd say, if it wasn't for the extremely unexplained ending.

Reading the manga would answer many of your questions, but I'm sorry to say it would also introduce more of them with no ending in sight.

**Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni/ Higurashi When They Cry: Episodes 1-4 (Rewatch)**

So I've been wanting to watch Higurashi again for a while. I even [made a post about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2wfbsy/spoilerswt_better_than_another_higurashi_no_naku/), and why people should watch it, and this only fueled my interest in the series further. I could not wait for the Steam re-release, which doesn't even have a release date yet, so I dived right in. 

I remembered a lot of the series capitalizing on the paranoia that comes with loneliness, but this is just cranked the fuck up. Characters are separating from each other and you think everyone is a serial murderer but you don't know because you're too paranoid and scared to look into it. 

What's interesting is that it's still technically classified as a "game" of sorts, since the viewer is supposed to have an active role in figuring out and solving the mystery. The twist at the end of episode 4, and the beginning of episode 5 provides some more rules as to how this game works, and from there it's up to the player to decide how to interpret the information they're being fed. And Higurashi's nature as a "game" is what makes it so well-written, especially in the second season of the show. 

Ultimately, I'm looking forward to rewatching the rest. Hope some of you decide to look into this little gem.

**Gurren Langan (16-27)**

I finished Gurren Langan and I absolutely loved it. It's the first 10 I've given on MAL. I'm sure it had flaws, but the epicness overwhelmed all my critical thinking facilities.

**Sword of the Stranger (1/1)**

Very entertaining movie. While the plot really wasn't original, and even at times confusing, I still loved the setting and premise. The creators of this movie really took the time to build a detailed world around their characters, from the gray beaches to the ambient sounds of the forest. The characters were very fun, if only a tad bit one-dimensional. However, these minor gripes are the only criticisms I could find with this movie. The animation was gorgeous and fluid. The fight scenes' choreography was extremely visually engaging and entertaining. But my highest praises go to the movie's soundtrack. Being the first thing that really stood out to me about this movie, the soundtrack was incredible for setting the tone of each and every scene. It was very reminiscent and definitely as good as a Studio Ghibli soundtrack. In total, **8.75/10**.

**Katanagatari (1/13)**

Having only seen the first episode with the rewatch club, I'm not *too* impressed. It'll take some time to get used to the long dialogue-driven episodes. I see a lot of potential in this anime, as it's very hyped by the anime community. I did think the choreography was great, however I can't stand the huge monologues that occur in the middle of fight scenes. **(TBA/10)**
>> ARTICLE
Finished Hajime no Ippo, it wasn't bad but I don't get why it's ranked #17 on MAL. Higher than all of Monogatari, all of Fate/Series, and Death Note. It's just not as good as advertised.

**The Flag Anime**

??/10 All of my what. [Very minor spoiler](/s "Regardless of trap-status, Megumu best girl.")

**Death Note**

(rewatch) I might actually prefer the anime for the fantasticly overly dramatic music and writing action. Also I very, very strongly prefer this ending. Though I missed [Ending spoiler](/s "The long line of followers going up the mountain, hoping to re-summon kira."). For some reason I cried at the ending this time. Idk man.

**Code Geass**

(rewatch) I'm rewatching this with two friends. During the ED I re-cap what they just saw and shortly explain some background. Now that they actually understand what they're watching they like it very much. (Small note in their defence: english is our second language and the code geass subtitles are fucking *fast*. When I watched it the first time I had to pause it every once in a while to properly read what the fuck they were saying.)
>> ARTICLE
**Anohana (completed)**  
Okay, I admit it, I cried. This is a really neat little show, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. First of all, this show is just so obvious about what it's trying to be. With a premise such as this one, you can completely predict what the show's going to be about and how it's going to end. But hey, at least it does it's job, and it does so in a well-crafted and satisfying manner.  
It was great to see the characters develop and grow closer to each other, especially since they all came off as complete assholes in the first episode. It still bothers me how Tsuruko and Poppo get almost no development compared to the other characters though. Visual direction is great, and the soundtrack is decent with a few standout pieces (I'll probably never be able to listen to Secret Base without crying again). Overall, a solid 8/10.

**Medaka Box (9/12)**  
I almost feel like I should have watched this before Kill la Kill, because that borrows so many ideas from this show. Anyway, this show continues to be great, the writers have an endless supply of wacky ideas and it's great to see Medaka beating everyone with her general OP-ness.  
edit: I just watched episode 10. This show has gone full shounen now. I don't even know anymore.

**Shigofumi 9-12/12**

Just go this recommended to me not long ago and decided to take a chance and watch it. All things considered it wasn't a bad show but I didn't really like the characters all that much. I actually wish it would have been more episodic show.
>> ARTICLE
**Now and Then, Here and There 13/13**

Jeez this show is dark. I watched the whole thing over the course of this week, but I almost didn't make it because I felt so disgusted by the terrible things done. This show touched on topics like genocide, child soldiers, rape, and so many other things. After finishing it today, I felt empty. That being said, it was a very good show and I am glad I watched it, but if you want a happy show this isn't it. 7/10 or 8/10 (Haven't fully formed my overall thoughts on it yet)

**Baccano! 2/13** 

I started watching this today after finishing Now and Then, Here and There. I cannot believe that I haven't given this show a chance before. I absolutely love it so far. Despite a confusing first episode, it still built an interesting world and filled it with interesting characters. And the second episode was just great. I can't wait to see how the stories unfold and look forward to the ride.

**FLCL 1-6/6**

Fun as hell, felt really disjointed at times, still have no idea who the antagonist really was, or if there actually was one. Damn good soundtrack, good animation, solid dub. Made me want to buy a Gibson EB-0. 9/10

**Sword Art Online 18-25/25+Sword Art Online II 1-18/24**

Most of my thoughts about these arcs are pretty much identical to my thoughts about the Aincrad Arc, though I didn't really like the Alfhiem or Excalibur arcs as much. Felt like they were, hell, I dunno, trying to keep the tension of the Aincrad arc up when there wasn't anywhere near as much danger. I did like the climax of Alfheim, even if it felt like a bit of a Deus ex Machina, and at one point actually shouted "Cut his dick off, Kirito!" out loud.

Gun Gale has probably been my favorite arc so far. I liked Sinon more than Asuna, and Desu Gun was a pretty decent antagonist. I thought that the climax of the Bullet of Bullets was good, and Sinon's [ ](/s "present grenade"), when combined with Kirito's reaction, was kinda cute. The "ASADA-SAN" scene was fucking creepy, though.

Overall, though, I'd still say that it's been worth my time. Good supporting characters, even if Kirito's not the best main. Solid animation, solid visuals, Yuki Kajiura's music, and good fight scene choreography. Maybe not a show that I would recommend to anyone to get them into anime, but it's not bad, even if it has a lot of wasted potential. Currently, 6-6.5/10

It was alright. Tbh I thought it was pretty cliche in many respects, but it was overall enjoyable.

**Mushishi (21/26)**

I need to finish this soon. Great anime, I just haven't been able to motivate myself to get through these last few episodes.

**Katanagatari (1/12)**

Rewatching with the rewatch group here. Good first episode.

**LoGH** (legend of the galactic heroes) **(20/110)**

Not gonna lie, it has been pretty boring up until now. No, I'm not looking for mindless action, but I'm not looking for something that will infodump me to death, either. I'm also not a fan of the characterization - Yang and Reinhard are fine (though they are massive Gary Stus, but they're likeable), but everyone around them is portrayed as either blindly loyal follower who idolizes them, or villain who antagonizes them in the most obnoxious way. The only other characters are subordinates to Yang/Reinhard and are themselves pretty Gary Stu/Mary Sue-ish, although Oberstein is a pretty interesting character. The tactics are not nearly as good as people say either; even the very premise of like 3 or 4 people commanding millions of ships is absurd, but this isn't a big deal. At least the political dialogue is sort of on point. I still have high hopes for this series since people tell me it gets really good in its second arc.
>> ARTICLE
Its more of a chain of command. Obviously its ridiculous to think that 4 admirals are commanding a fleet of thousands of ships. They give orders and they're given further down the chain.

Aria The Origination (8-13/13)

I could not think of a more perfect ending for this series. The way it was done was perfect in every regard. You could feel how this chapter of life ended and how a new one began. The way it handled the characters and their interactions was fantastic and I wasn't able to think of any flaw in Origination.

I just thought it would be like Oreimo but backwards and only a little bit more ecchier. But what happened was, I watched a show that I would consider hentai. On MAL, its only genres are "ecchi, romance, and seinen". Apparently, it was too censored to be considered a hentai. Anyway, I ended up watching a show that has a lot more ecchi than Highschool DxD, a show that I used to think had the most.            

[**Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth** (movie)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion:_Death_&_Rebirth)  - I was thinking of saving the movies for later, so I'd have more to watch but someone here said that it would be better to watch them now so that it's still on my mind. I might watch End of Evangelion later or tomorrow. Death and Rebirth was really great. About half of it was a nice recap of everything that happened, so that was cool. A lot of things happened in the series, so I didn't get all of them. It's really nice since it went over the important points. The second half is the start of End of Evangelion? That was really awesome too. [End of Evangelion/Death and Rebirth huge spoilers](/s "RIP in pieces Asuka :(")

CPed from a post over on r/trueanime: 

Continuing my break from ZZ gundam to re=watch School Rumble. So I think I got to episode 10 of the second season of School Rumble. It's still just as great as I remembered it; hands down the best school life show I've ever seen. The comedy is mostly hits all around. The characters are fantastic and the way they develop can be really interesting sometimes. Sawachika in particular has great character development as well as Ichijou. There isn't really much to say other than that really. Hopefully I'll be able to finish it up this week and move on to some other stuff. I added like 10 fairly short things to my PTW(La Portrait de Petit Cossette, Patlabor OVA's, and Angel's Egg among others) in the last couple of days so hopefully I will have a lot more to say next week.

Sawachika best girl.

That said, Harima is fucking hilarious. He's just such a well-written character. I'll always remember School Rumble as being best in its first season. Second season is fine too, especially the school shootout, but then there's [spoiler](/s "the downer ending")...ugh. I'm just glad the author at least decided to wrap things up a bit better in School Rumble Z.
>> ARTICLE
Yea this is my second watch as I said. I can't quite remember the ending to season 2 so I'll see what I think. That said I guess it's not really a show that lends itself very well to real endings. There are just so many fantastic ships that I would love to see. Harima x Eri, Harima x Tenma, Harima x Yakumo, Miko x Hanai, Miko x Oso... The list just goes on and on. Sawachika is indeed best girl though. That said it's hard to really go against Yakumo since she is basically perfect by definition. I might have to reread some of the manga too so I can cover the rest of the source material. Which as I remembered they actually left a pretty large chunk un-animated. Quite unfortunate.

Watched the first 2 episodes of Golion. Animation quality is quite good, seeing as it came out in 1980 and I am quite liking the premise of it, just waiting for some of mech fights to start to see if I should really continue with it or not.

Finished Kino no Tabi. All I have to say is that last episode... my eyes can't stop sweating... 

Fantastic show. Would recommend.

Haven't watched much this week...

**Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex**. Wow, what a great show. Looks only a bit dated even though it aired in 2002. I'll definitely upload my screenshots for the next Lax Thursdays since there are some great backgounds.

**Sennen Joyuu**. This one is also from early 2000s. My third Satoshi Kon movie. I really liked it but I still think Paprika is my favorite of his works.
>> ARTICLE
**Mobile Suit Gundam I-III**

I wanted to know more of the franchise story, so what better way than to start here. I opted for the movies, which some people may not agree with, but it happens. I'm watching the dub, and while it does get pretty silly sometimes, it's pretty decent. Especially with Char being Steve Blum. I recognized Amuro as Doug Erholtz, who plays Kankuro in Naruto. 

I'm actually only halfway through MSG III right now, but I'll finish it by the end of the day. I can't wait to watch more of the Universal Century continuity

Steins;Gate Movie, OVA, And series- 

I must say that when I was reccomended Steins;Gate, I didn't know what to expect. I've had it on my watch list since I saw the Glass Reflection review of it and Mirai Nikki. I really enjoyed it, even though I had the most emotional scene slightly spoiled for me. (Well, spoiled but I still didn't see it coming).

Lovely Complex...

I dont know if its count but Fairy tail. Started from episode 78~ this week and have caught up with the serie. 

I have enjoy Fairy tail so far, its really a fun serie to watch and i love the characters and theirs interaction. 
The only thing i didnt like about Fairy tail was the repeated pattern in every arc(not much in the Grand magic games) which i got bored of and had to put it on hold for a while. Back than the reason i kept watching was because how much i love the characters interaction and actually wanted Fariy tail to be a SoL serie. But my opinion changed when they introduce the Grand magic games arc, which is my favorite arc. Now im totally hooked on the serie and a bit sad that i need to wait for new episodes :( Otherwise was the serie good. The fillers was ok, they were like 100times  better than Naruto fillers, had a fun time watching them. 

My top 3 favorite arcs: 

1.Grand Magic games
                                 
 2.Tenrou island
                                
 3.Edolas [Mainly](/s "because i love when they meet their Edolas counterpart")

I watched Dusk Maiden of Amnesia. I expected PLOT so my expectations where low. Was pleased when I got actual plot and was taken for a ride on the feels train.

And they fuck it all up when the guy opens the box and she comes back making the previous episode fucking pointless.").

**White Album 2**

Pretty good, but I feel as though they could have condensed the first half of the show. It felt really dragged on and the second half was much more interesting.

**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun**

Pretty funny, if a bit generic.

**When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace**

Kinda funny, but really generic. The daft girl's breakdown was the highlight of the show.

**Ping Pong - The Animation**

Rewatched this - yup, still one of my favourite series of all time.

**YuYuYu** 

Yuuki Yuuna Wa Yuusha De Aru (2/21-2/22)

Started watching yesterday and finished it today. What a train ride that was. 

If I saw it on anicharts that season, I probably wouldn't have paid much attention to it and crossed it off as a stereotypical "cute-girls-doing-cute-things" anime.

It was a pleasant surprise of a show that f**ked me harder than Madoka. 

[Ending Spoilers](/s "The happy ending took me for a whirl there. Not entirely sure how I am supposed to feel after going through the whole depressing plot only to arrive at Christmas-land. Never the less, it was still enjoyable and definitely was worthwhile.")

[**Henneko/The "Hentai" Prince and the Stony Cat \(3-12/12\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15225/Hentai_Ouji_to_Warawanai_Neko)

Since I am only three episodes in my opinion of the show is definitely not final. It is currently better than I expected. Some of the character interactions are quite funny. So far I am not rooting for any character to be with the MC (Youto Yokodera) because I don't really like the MC. I will probably finish this anime this week. 

Also what anime should I watch next from my "Plan to Watch" list on my [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Nelsong95)?

>> ARTICLE
Elfen Lied and Medaka Box.

I enjoyed Elfen Lied because I went into it with little to no context besides that the main female lead was named Lucy and that the show was filled with gore.

The [](/s "beating the dog to death scene") I couldn't look at because I [](/s "have two dogs of my own") and I love them to death. I was incredibly rustled when that took place.

Medaka Box I didn't like but I saw through to the end of the first season. Medaka's overwhelming positivity and surety that she could change people to the greater good just rubbed me the wrong way.

**Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 16/25**

I honestly had much higher hopes for this one. The first season ended so amazingly (even though it was a cliffhanger), yet the beginning of season 2 almost entirely disregards it. It actually get really good as it goes on but it just feels like the second season disregarded all the momentum it had from the first and I couldn't help but roll my eyes. It's worth watching but be prepared to roll your eyes so hard on episode one that they might go 360 degrees and be back to the same position. Some stuff from the first season do get resolved so it's a little annoying that it lost so much of it's momentum, imho.

Forgive my rant, it IS worth watching. This was more like my particular annoyance with it.

Another week, another set of popular anime down.

**Ao no Exorcist**

We have a new leader in the clubhouse, ladies and gentlemen, and it is for the World's Most Boringly Generic Supernatural Combat Anime. The most it ever got from me was eye-rolling of an increasingly painful degree. From the bland characters to the boring plot, I didn't have a single gram of interest in the entire 25-episode run. 

The only thing that might have gotten more than just an eyeroll out of me was a negative: the traditional Japanese misunderstanding of Western theology. It's not the first time this has come across my path, with Toaru Majutsu no Index being a significant example, but it has to be one of the most glaring examples of cultural misunderstanding in my entire suite. From completely wrong references to Faust, demonology, the Church, and just about everything, Ao no Exorcist failed on every single measure.

If you don't know much about those things, then who knows. You just might like this. If, on the other hand, you've drenched your brain with far too much knowledge of exceptionally esoteric subjects, then you probably won't be able to suspend your disbelief for long enough to get interested.

Score: 5/10  
Recommendation Level: Watch it before you know better.

**Another**

I'm not a fan of horror. At all. I have to be in a very specific mood in order to watch anything like this, or else I'm probably not going to like it.

Thank goodness I know exactly how to create that mood. Because Another was definitely worth the ride.

One thing about horror titles that is absolutely necessary for a successful experience is that the writing must be of high quality. The set-up must be believable in order to suspend the disbelief of the viewer. The twists need to come in just the right order. It has to have a connection to the mundane in order to provide a hint as to how to survive. And it also has to have a few other things that would turn this comment into a philosophy of film thesis, but that would have me typing until next Friday and leave me little time for more anime.

And because many of you would prefer that I shut the hell up, I'll go ahead and wind this down.

Another worked well on all of these metrics. With exceptional writing and execution, wonderful suspense moments, and a well-designed hook to get to the resolution, Another made all the correct moves at all the right times. Add in some sympathetic characters (always a plus in horror films) and some interesting references to some of the well-done American horror movies (Omen, Final Destination, and Scream were the ones that stuck in my mind.) gave Another just enough to put it into the very exceptional range.

Of the "Watch A Bunch Of Popular Anime" experiment I've been doing over the last few weeks, this one has to be my favorite so far. 

Score: 9/10  
Recommendation Level: Yes. Unless you hate being scared. Then no. 

**Elfin Lied**  
Status: 6/13

Only at the half-way mark so far, but I'm liking what I'm seeing. More next week, as I've been typing for an hour already.

On-deck: **Bakemonogatari** and the 500th Entry Celebration watch of **Nana**
>> ARTICLE
Another is as much of a horror movie as last destination.. It doesn't really remain creepy after the first three episodes. Becomes all about the silly ways each character will die. 
>> ARTICLE
Is Another really a "popular" anime? I've only just started browsing r/anime, but I haven't seen it mentioned much in other places. Regardless though, totally agree, I loved the series and story/sense of mystery. I'd give it a solid 9/10 and am happy to have it on bluray
>> ARTICLE
For popularity, I generally go by [this page](http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php?type=bypopularity) on MyAnimeList that rates Another at #29 in popularity. That puts it in the same range as Bakemonogatari, One Piece, and Neon Genesis Evangelion. And while MAL isn't exactly the end-all and be-all for anime, it serves me fairly well as a measuring stick.

**Guilty Crown 5-15/22**

Picked it back up because I was curious as to why it was so hated by /r/anime. Especially because my friend really liked it and he even rewatched the show. I thought that the show would get better, but it didn't. Still watching the train wreck, but at this point, I really don't care about anything in the show.

I watched the entirety of **Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood**.  

Through probably the first 40 episodes, i was ready to say this show was a 10/10, I was really enjoying it.

During the final arc, the pacing really slowed down, and I was really disappointed with how the final battle played out because it felt like a massive Deus ex Machina.  The epilogue was pretty good and I felt like enough of the story resolved, but getting through that prolonged final battle was just rough.

I gave it an 8/10.

Shows that are up next is between Eureka Seven, Durarara, Hyouka, FLCL, and K-on Season 2.

EDIT: slight rewording.
>> ARTICLE
Knights of Sidonia - 1-12/12

Really enjoyed the show. Wasn't sure about CG for the entire show, but honestly it worked really well. Liked the characters, liked the story and concept. Was pretty surprised with it. Excited for season 2 this year!
Score: 8/10
Recommend?: Yes

The Devil is a Part-Timer! - 1-13/13

Absolutely loved this show. Great concept, hilarious situations, dialogue, story, and characters. I WANT MORE OF THIS SO BADLY. Ordering the Bluray very soon. The dub was also great. 
Score: 9/10
Recommend?: YES ABSOLUTELY

Noragami - 4-12/12

Got bored after the first 3 episodes about a month back, but finally decided to give it another shot and ended up really liking it. Yato is a great character, and while Yukine pissed me off at points I liked the way they resolved his arc with that extremely intense arc. I also want another season of this.
Score: 8.5/10
Recommend?: Yup.

Ghost Stories - 1/20

I read some stuff about the dub in an old thread on here and wanted to see what it was all about. People weren't kidding when they said it was essentially an officially licensed abridged series and it is pretty damn funny. Not sure if I'll keep watching, as I watched a "best of" video, but we'll see.

Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward OVA - 1/1

Really liked the game, so this was cool to see, but as a standalone thing it wouldn't do much for anyone else.
Score: 6
Recommend?: Only if you liked the game or are planning on playing it soon
>> ARTICLE
**Knights of Sidonia** (11&12/12)

I feel like these two episodes weren't that great. Like most modern anime with on-going source material, the end of the first season is usually anime original (I'm not sure if this is the case here) and/or they'll have to hope that there's a place in the source material that is a good stopping point for the first season. The climatic big battle felt really shoehorned in. Oh well, I still loved the first 9 episodes, and Sidonia season one gets a 8/10 from me. Looking forward to second season. 

**Durarara!!** (13-16/24)

I took a long hiatus from Durarara!! at the end of the first arc since it felt like such a great place to take a break. I like it, but it's not giving me the "I have to keep going hurry up and play the next episode" feeling that its predecessor Baccano! gave me. The end of episode 16 is moving things along again, so we'll see how the rest of the show fares. 

Edit: Just watched 17 of Durarara!!... then 18... now 19... Safe to say, the "I have to keep going hurry up and play the next episode" vibe is here.

**Dragon Ball Z** (113-291)

Pretty cool show. Finally out of the Frieza arc and wow did that take a while. Still fun though. Current arc seems a bit filler-like but still fun. I loved the breather episode with Vegeta the tsundere. Can Chichi just disappear? She is super annoying. I can't wait for more.
>> ARTICLE
**Samurai Champloo 1-9**

Pretty good so far. Love Nujabes, so it's pretty enjoyable. Nothing AMAZING so far, but it's overally just a nice show.

**Darker than Black OVA 1-4**

So I have DTB downloaded and started watching. One thing though, it was out of order and accidentally watch the OVA first. All of it. Fuck. So yeah, i watched that before I started first season on accident...uhh....

**Darker than Black 1-4**

Things starting to make a little bit more sense. Liking the show. Hei is fucking smooth, man. That social engineering. What a guy. The show's been good, and I honestly think watching OVA first wasn't terrible, but definitely not recommended.

**Legend of the Galactic Heroes 1-3**

It's a bit slow right now, but I don't mind too much. I've been told it gets amazing, and the concept seems really cool right now. The scale is MASSIVE, way bigger scale than any show I've seen (except *ahem* Gurren Lagann...). I really like the the commanders, and I can see how this will get political and very interesting the future.

**Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni 15-22**

I'll finish it tonight. I watched the show years ago, but forgot almost everything, so I rewatched it. Love the show. It's a really great show and I highly recommend to anyone who's interested in it.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (64/64)**

Best shounen I've seen. 10/10

**Bakemonogatari (7/15)**

Finally got around to watching again. It's getting easier to process with each passing episode. That train scene where Senjougahara showed Ararararagi her pantsu was so heartwarming :)

**Clannad (8/23)**

Resumed this one, too. I'm getting the feeling that the starfish girl is some sort of ghost? Funny, cute show so far, but nothing extraordinary.

**Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (10/26)**

Holy crap, this show is thrilling. Kaiji has to pay off his massive debts with high-stakes gambling. I have a feeling this will be over quickly because it's so easy to marathon.

**Pale Cocoon (1/1)**

This short OVA takes place in a bleak, sparsely habited world that humans have damaged. The main character discover a visual record that inspires him to visit the dangerous planet surface and make a big discovery. I have a really hard time rating short stories highly, and this is no exception. There is just not enough time for character development or for me to build a deep connection. That said, Pale Cocoon was well-paced and had a slightly ambiguous ending. 6/10

Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion 2. I just realised [my ](/s "views about Lelouch not being dead at the end of series might be wrong.")

The entirety of Raildex, including the specials and the movie. That was a fun ride.

Little Witch Academia, because when I learned it was a short I placed it higher on my animu queue, and I reached that point by this week. IT. WAS. BEAUTIFUL.

Death Billiards followed that because why not. After all it was another short and it spawned the beauty that is Death Parade.

Yuru Yuri. Fun, but sometimes the pacing got slow.

Black Rock Shooter TV. It was really pretty and I liked the story even though it was slightly confusing at the start and the first 3 episodes were misleading. Though knowing Ordet I couldn't stop thinking that the TV release must have looked terrible (watched the BD in 1080p).

Binbougami ga! - Really fun but sometimes the drama dragged on too long.

Yuyushiki. Had trouble staying awake by the final episode. Too slow, probably should have watched it episodically instead of binging it in a few hours.

Cowboy Bebop. Holy fuck that was great. I still have the movie pending though.

And started Oreimo and Baccano. I was really biased against Oreimo because of its fame and that some called it "harem" (I despise harems), but looked interesting. And Baccano looked REALLY interesting, and knowing it's from the writer of Durarara only made me hype it more.

(It wasn't only the past week though, I counted two or three extra days. Started Raildex on two weeks ago's Thursday)
>> ARTICLE
**Spice and Wolf II (12/12)**

While I enjoyed the character interaction between our two protagonists Craft Lawrence and Holo, I can't help but engage myself fully with the anime despite it being one of the better ones handling romance. I guess the economics really just went over my head.

This anime is one of those anime where I can't fully immerse myself into wholly liking it, but the qualities of what makes it a good anime is quite apparent of being granted at the very least a 7/10 - despite my lack of personal engagement with it. Its a shame that I don't like it as much as /r/anime does.

Oh yeah and the [ending] (/s "sucked with that cliffhanger. I mean come on I don't really want a season 3 but the people who loved Spice and Wolf pretty much got blue balled for that cliffhanger ending") and no season 3 in sight.

**Mirai Nikki (16/24)**

I have put this series on hold until the discussion thread catches up to where I am. Hopefully the remainder of the series can impress me enough to grant it a higher grading, because at the moment things aren't looking very bright for Mirai Nikki on my ratings.

Not to say I didn't at least get some entertainment out of it, though critically the plot could be better and it doesn't really offer a whole lot.

**Log Horizon (25/25)**

Great anime if you're an MMO player, especially true if you invested a lot of time into economics and was interested in the political landscape of MMOs (i.e. EVE). Its inevitable that there will be parallels drawn between SAO and Log Horizon, but I'll just go ahead and say that Log Horizon is faithful to MMO, game mechanics and immerses itself into providing an "MMO-like experience" environment - SAO doesn't provide that because it never really intended to and would rather use MMO as a backdrop (not that its a demeaning quality unless you expected it to be like an MMO).

DATABASE DATABASE WOW WOW

I'm slowly watching the second season but something else is holding my attention at the moment, which happens to be the anime below:

**Steins;Gate (4/24)**

I'm not sure how people say the first half of the anime is boring, because the protagonist's personality to be quite hilarious and amusing. I'm enjoying it, but I will find out in due time whether or not its really a masterpiece or well, just worthy enough for me to rate it as a personal 10/10. 

Its never easy for any sort of anime to be given a high rating with lots of hype riding behind it - much like Spice and Wolf which I felt was a good anime but on a bit overrated on a personal level.

Hunter X Hunter!

I'm sad that the anime ends after this Arc as far as I know, but maybe I'll pick up the manga one day.

Finished off:

**K-ON!!**: total moeverload. Cried like a bitch at the end. Currently watching the movie, as an Englishman it's interesting to see how accurate the backgrounds are (they got quite a lot of London spot-on, and the English characters actually have English accents, which is a refreshing change).

**Fate/Zero**: slightly underwhelmed by the end, felt a bit rushed. Could've easily done with another episode or a 45-minute special at the end there. Overall 8/10 though.

Starting:

**Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya** Too. Fucking. Cute.

**Yuru Yuri Nachuyachumi!** Hour-long OVA featuring a camping trip with all the Yurus. Bloody brilliant.

**Legends of Galactic Heroes (47-70/110)**

Not gonna lie, I got a little bit angry at the events of episode 70. I just can't believe it. The bullshit is real. Then again, when Rosen Ritter is involved, enemies cry in fear. They're basically Inaho from Aldnoah.Zero, in context that they can do the job while other regiments just fail, allies or enemies.

Other than that, I really enjoyed the battle between Yang and Reinhard. As usual, tactics that were used by Reinhard we logical, while tactic used by Yang were just random but effective, because it throws everyone off their comfort zone I feel. Too bad Yang is no Nelson, even though I'd hate it [spoiler](/s "if he had managed to kill Reinhard in battle by employing such a bullshit tactic"). 

PS. I don't know why I can't mark the text. It just gives off a link. Even if I copy template, the result is same. For now you'll just have to hover over the spoiler to see what is written there.
 
The meetup after the battle was very interesting as well. You can literally see how both characters understand each other.

Also, Yang gives the best speeches to public.

**Mirai Nikki (3-9/26)(Rewatch)**

It is rather interesting to watch it again, because you can reflect on what you already know and character motivations. To be honest, I thought it would get boring, knowing everything. Glad I was wrong.

I did try Gundam Wing some time ago, but I kinda dropped it. I don't even remember why, maybe dub just didn't work for me so I could try sub. For now I will probably go with Gundam 00 S2 when I am in mood for more "philosophizing on violence."

Right now I just can't go through that.

Thanks for suggestion.

[**Gintama 130-180/201**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama)

Been trying to get caught up on this for the new season obviously. I got stuck in the middle of the Kintaro arc for almost 2 weeks because of how much I hated it. Even though it's only two episodes I couldn't bring myself to finish it up. I was really disappointed with it after how great the rest of the series is. The Otsu arc was also disappointing and felt really dragged out. The Yoshiwara in flames arc however was amazing and is easily my favorite one so far.

[**Hyouka 8/22**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka)

It's okay so far but doesn't really stand out as the stellar series everyone claims it is.

Need something to watch in the background organizing and re downloading a bunch of stuff on my computer so I chose this. Forgot how hilarious it is but was disappointed by the lack of any real conclusion (Silly me assuming a harem anime would have an actual conclusion). Hadn't seen the OVA yet and lost it at the [Spoiler](/s "School Days reference")

[Spice & Wolf] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/5341/Ookami_to_Koushinryou_II)

Just finishing the second season of this and I'm quite conflicted about it. The first season was something I found immensely enjoyable, while the first 6 episodes of the second season were truly appalling. 

For one, that's not how auctions work, yet in the first season it was the economics plot that so appealed to me. For another, where's the amazing witty banter between the leads? Instead you get just cliche tsundere tantrums, screaming and crying and all that irritating shit. Further, they've retconed stuff into the plot of the first season - [](/s "the idea that Lawrence knew all along her destination didn't exist anymore.") This might reinterpret their behavior during it. Next, her motivation doesn't even make that much sense to me - [](/s "sage wolf horo being unprepared to think her pace of origin might no longer exist after centuries of being away? For one this is atypical behavior for her, for such natural effects of the passage of time never phase her otherwise. For another I can't buy her caring about it that much because she had centuries to check up on it yet didn't. I guess she could be tied to the land while protecting it and unable to travel even for a short while, though that seems lame, that wolf form is quick and further we know she appeared in this form to at least talk to people before. Anyhow, I just don't buy her sadness.") Finally, behavior of Lawrence after that is both pointless and appaling. [](/s "he has no power, even if he had the desire, to stop horo from going away anywhere she wants. You know, she not being a slave, she being a huge wolf that can go where she pleases etc. So what's the point or possible reward of playing that auction game to begin with? He's in a perfect situation of being sure to get free money, and all he has to do is sit back and not meddle in the market. And at no point is he in a situation to do anything to limit horo's choices anyhow. Yet the plot is driven by him trying to own horo by crashing a market. A goal as disgusting as it is futile. Yet continues to get respect with anyone he interacts with and suggests his intentions to.") 

Its sadly so often the case that the way these Japanese authors depict romantic behavior seems usually appalling and disgusting to me. Few exceptions I've seen yet are the crescent/banner of the stars, which is so adorable, and kids on the slope. 

Looks like a toxic cocktail of anger, sadness and jealously, expressed in on-screen pointless jelling, pathetic weeping and inexcusable aggression, and I don't get why any leads would drink that poison.

Second half of the second season seems to be making up for this in the wit department, the economics plot is more enjoyable, and art and music and food continue to contribute to great wordlbuilding.

So 8/10 for s1, 6/10 for s2.

[Gunbuster] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/949/Top_wo_Nerae!_Gunbuster)

As someone who had endless disappointments with stuff marked Shounen up to this point, this was one great positive surprise. 

The story is straightforward, but quite hard SF. It does require changes to physics, and makes these changes not randomly but by plausibly depicting the development of the field. It's so amazingly rare to see that done right in hard SF. As a subgenre it usually needs to either stay within known physics or the transition requires quite a big suspension of disbelief. Not nearly so bad here however.

The technobabble portion it gave about it was so great (still babble mind you, but so well done), because much of it was about actually relevant parts of physics and with the right vocabulary. [](/s "for eg, It defined bosons and fermions correctly (and I was about to jump at it with \"but this is obvious, no brilliant physicist would need to spend a sentence on this in a scientific paper\" - but then it turns out the sentence is from a highschool paper, which is quite appropriate), it namedropped for eg, Yangs-Mill gauge theories etc. It didn't use whatever for FTL but rather it described Kerr black holes.") So its a history-of-science hard-SF moment done amazingly right. [] (/s "Temporal dilatation having prominent role in the story is another huge props")

I guess I should rave about this for quite some time. How Noriko is a great lead, especially for a female character depiction that can easily go so terribly wrong, how unique it is to see some time given to the effort needed to even manage to control a mecha well, how amazingly gunbuster looks etc.

But this has been long enough already and beyond maybe my technobabble rant has all been said before quite often.

9/10. Really my 8, 9, 10 and favs are a mess, until I rewatch them all the differences mean little.

[Redline](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6675/Redline)

I'm a bit tired from writing the last two, so I'll keep this brief - pedestrian story, but with well-made dialogues. However, soooo gorgeous! Imagination that drips from every frame is in quite a different league. 8/10

[Ghost in a Shell - Stand alone Complex] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex) both seasons and 
[Ghost in a Shell - Stand alone Complex - Solid State Society] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/1566/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex_-_Solid_State_Society)

Ahh, yes, this is cyberpunk done so right. Tachikoma moments in the first season were a bit irritating, and the setup in the first season was of slightly less socially relevant variety, So I've provisionally given the first season 8 while the film and especially the second season sit on a 9. But subject to change for sure. 

Gritty realism, power plays and politics, a realistic art-style that matches it, a storyline mirroring real world issues -- I can clearly see this is being done by the same director as the great "eden of the east" in these aspects, only with an even stronger premise -- , a rather well-done early take on 2d and 3d blending, though not quite seamless, still one of the better ones I've seen, stellar music - one of those shows where you don't often even skip the opening theme.. 

This is how a well-rounded anime of top quality feels like, with no glaring flaws to the masterpiece.

[Ghost in a Shell - Arise] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/17187/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Arise_-_Border:1_Ghost_Pain) and on. I hate how I can't group series in MAL.

On the other hand, this offers nothing but good looking CG. If this were a live-action show, I'd be raving how amazing a solid piece of cyberpunk is. Given the competition in anime however, the pedestrian if occasionally solid story barely raises it above average. 

6/10

[Rose of Versailles] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/338/Rose_of_Versailles)

I'm still going through this one, and it seems quite great. Provisionally a 9/10. I do have a bit of a problem with [](/s "Oscar defeating so many foes at the start, and how court intrigue suspiciously resembles schoolyard intrigue - though maybe this is not incorrect either. However correct implications to world peace from it are quickly drawn so it immediately rises above the possible triviality,") its take on Marie Antoinette is quite promising. Animation has certainly stood the test of quite a lot of time.

Interesting detail [] (/s "with that blotch on the marriage certificate. I remember Gankutsuou speaking about that historic blotch as a bad omen well. Wonder if the storyboarder there remembered Rose of Versailles and subtly referenced it, or is that minor history detail just generally popular in Japan, as a kind of bad omen for the rule. ")

Since it was not something mentioned in my history lessons for sure, though it is true.

Let's get things kicked off with an unpopular opinion. I finished **White Album 2** this week, and I honestly thought it was one of the most overrated shows I've seen in a long time. It's not that it was awful, but from the way everybody was hyping it up on here, I was expecting it to be a complete revelation complete with engaging, multifaceted characters and a compelling story. It ended up being an alright romance with a few heavy emotional moments that was held down by an unlikable fuck of an MC who deserved every bit of emotional anguish he received and quite a bit more. Again, it wasn't bad, just shallower than I expected. The music was pretty great though.

Moving on to something more positive, I completely devoured all of **Shinsekai Yori**, and it was absolutely incredible. One of the only shows I've seen that I can genuinely say I wish I could go back and watch again for the first time. The setting was unbelievably good, the characters were all compelling and multidimensional, and the story it told raised interesting and complex questions about the nature of humanity. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that this show can serve as the exemplar of how to tell a mature story without having to include an abundance of mature content. It portrayed the consequences and agonies of violence without having to cover my screen in gore, showed the emotional and interpersonal ramifications of sexuality without ever showing so much a single sex act (not to mention portrayed characters of various sexual orientations without making those orientations the focal point of their character). Seriously, if you've never seen this show, you are missing out.

I got about halfway through the first season of **A Certain Magical Index**, which has been a fun show so far. There's really not a whole lot to say about it other than the fact that it's entertaining and consistent without being particularly thought provoking. It's smarter than your average shounen, but I don't think it's going to be rocking my world or anything. That said, Accelerator is cool as hell, and now I'm a little salty that he got kicked off in the first round of Best Guy.

Alas, I've finished the last installment of Monogatari Weekends with **Tsukimonogatari**. I found this one to be the best of the specials, a bit better than Hana- and bounds better than Neko-: Kuro. Ononoki is still as weirdly compelling as she's always been, and I like seeing her get a little more attention. I must say that I did find myself tuning out occasionally, but for the most part, it was pretty interesting. It was also good to see the Fire Sisters get a little bit more love, after they were shamefully neglected in most of Second Season. Now, I need something to fill the Monogatari-shaped void in my life, so I'm thinking about trying Mekakucity Actors, which I've heard is Monogatari-like to an extent, but I doubt it'll be as good. Still, couldn't hurt to try though.

I'm eight episodes into **Sakura Trick**, which cuts the nonsense and delivers all the yuri you could ever ask for without having to bet bogged down in silly things like plot and character development. The thing is, I don't care about the lack of plot because it mesmerizes me with cute girls kissing each other all the time. I like it in much the same way that I like Kiniro Mosaic, in that it's something that just makes me feel nice when I watch it. I'll be sad when it's over.

Lastly, I've been loosely following the rewatch of **The Yuno Gasai Variety Hour**, known in some circles as **Mirai Nikki**. The MC really is an insufferable little twerp. I understand a fourteen year old acting like a bitch when his life is in mortal peril, but he does it even when there's no apparent danger. Also, his Japanese VA has one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard, in an anime or otherwise. I'll probably continue to loosely keep up with it just for Yuno, but part of me wonders how long this show will be able to float past my critical faculties on a balloon made of sold yandere. I guess only time will tell.

I think that nails down why everyone likes it.

Also I agree with everything you said about Shinsekai Yori and I'm sad it'll be ending for me in a few days.

Shakugan no Shana (Season 1 - 3). 

Found this anime as a recommendation of Zero no Tsukaima and have to say it was overall rather decent in enjoyment. The first season is the strongest of the three with the second being the weakest in my opinion (focuses too much on SOL rather than story progression and just feels out of place.) 
First season had me hooked from the very first episode, it opens with a scene that instantly had me wondering what was going on.
Art style - the art is pretty good, nothing to write home about, the spells and battles are rather well done. 
Story line - it's rather predictable at times but overall rather enjoyable. Third season does throw a spanner in the works and completely changes everything which can put people off, however I found it rather more enjoyable than the second season. If you liked ZnT this feels like a bit more serious version of it. Overall 7/10 


Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei.
If you like overpowered characters from the start this is one to watch. At first I found it a bit overbearing with how powerful the main character is and how he just seems to take things in his stride but I found myself getting to a point of just wondering how he can beat this next opponent and what other crazy ideas he can come up with. 
Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is surprisingly rich in explanations on how the magic works and the techniques used without overly boring you and makes it reasonably logical to understand. The world itself is rich and rather well developed and has a lot of characters, from side characters to main they all have some part to play. 
The art style is beautiful in this with fight scenes looking stunning. The general art and locations are also rather well done. 
Take this one with a pinch of salt, let yourself just sit back and enjoy it without analysing everything and this is a fun anime to watch. 7/10

Tayutama - Kiss on my deity
Can't say too much on this one as I didn't manage to finish it. Art style is good with pleasing visuals, there is fan-service in this, but the characters designs are rather good and varied. Storyline is rather basic and a bit lackluster, I managed to get to the 9th episode and just got bored and found it lacked something, overall it's an alright series that just seems to miss something. 6/10

Oda Nobuna no Yabou -
 Only just started this and have watched two episodes and I will say I am enjoying it a lot. Characters seem likeable and the main character's actions keep making me giggle already especially with how he reacts with others.

**One Piece** 1-103/-

Basically I wanted to catch up on this because reasons. I remember watching it as a child and I was a fan. Animation quality is not that great. Story is average but I still like it. Also I discovered that the german dub actually has a different opening than sub. I like both but prefer the (dub opening video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1Xw31qQRGo] The song is really cheasy. The show is really easy to binge watch. 

**Tokyo Ravens** 1-24/24

Talk about average. Story is predictable. The art is just standard. The magic system is completely unexplained. the characters aren't that bad but their choices are sometimes stupid and make no sense. 5/10

**Redline** 1/1

Beautiful art and sound. I love every character. The story is pretty predictable if you have ever seen a racing movie, but the execution is awesome. Best anime movie I watched. 10/10

**[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex season 1](http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex)**

after watching the film i expected more of the same, but the series was actually very different. It just never seemed to have the same
impact that the film did which is surprising since series have more time to elaberate on these things. Its not that i didn't like the series
 just that i much preferd the darker serious tone that the film had. 7/10

**[Kaiji season 1 & 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3002/Gyakkyou_Burai_Kaiji:_Ultimate_Survivor)**

I had already seen Akagi so i had a vague idea of what i was getting into, but kaiji blew all my expectations
 out of the water. A big factor is that unlike Akagi i could actually understand what was happening but to be honest it improved on it 
in almost everyday. Of course the characters were a lot more relatable, kaiji himself was so good, i dont think iv rooted for a character
this hard since gurren lagann. One of the most marathon-able shows around, its addictive, you cant stop watching since the tension is kept 
so high. i would kill for a season 3, i think iv found a new favorate here 9/10 ZAWA ZAWA~

Ah alright it's the new one. I heard the old ones are better actually. They generally seem similar but I get the feeling the old one is probably a lot more of a gorefest. Which is fitting since the manga is pretty much a cheesy 80's gorefest of a manga. Still great though.
